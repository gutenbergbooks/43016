<p class="ac lg150">INTRODUCTION TO THE NOTES</p>

  <p><a name="sect1">§ 1</a>. In the brief Introduction to vol. iv. I have
  given a list of the MSS. of the Canterbury Tales; some account of the
  early printed editions; and some explanation of the methods employed in
  preparing the present edition. I propose here to discuss further certain
  important points of general interest. And first, I would say a few words
  as to the Canon of Chaucer's Works, whereby the genuine works are
  separated from others that have been attributed to him, at various times,
  by mistake or inadvertence.</p>

<p class="ac"><a name="sect2">§ 2</a>. <span class="sc">Canon of Chaucer's Works.</span></p>

  <p>This has already been considered, at considerable length, in vol. i.
  pp. 20-90. But it is necessary to say a few words on the whole subject,
  owing to the extremely erroneous opinions that are so widely
  prevalent.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a poem is claimed for Chaucer because it occurs 'in a
  Chaucer MS.' There is a certain force in this plea in a few cases, as I
  have already pointed out. But it commonly happens that such MSS. (as, for
  example, MS. Fairfax 16, MS. Bodley 638, and others) are mere collections
  of poetry of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, from which nothing
  can safely be inferred as to the authorship of the poems which they
  contain, unless the scribe distinctly gives the author's name<a
  name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. As a rule, however, the
  scribes not only omit to mention names, but they frequently omit the very
  title of the poem, and thus <!-- Page x --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagex"></a>[x]</span>withhold such help as, in many cases, they
  might easily have afforded.</p>

  <p>The celebrated first edition of 'Chaucer's Works,' edited by William
  Thynne in 1532, made no attempt to establish any canon. Thynne simply put
  together such a book as he believed would be generally acceptable; and
  deliberately inserted poems which he knew to be by other authors. Some of
  these poems bear the name of Lydgate; one has the name of Gower; and
  another, by Hoccleve, is dated 1402, or two years after Chaucer's death.
  They were tossed together without much attempt at order; so that even the
  eleventh poem in the volume is 'The Floure of Curtesie, made by Ihon
  lidgate.' The edition, in fact, is a mere collection of poems by Chaucer,
  Lydgate, Gower, Hoccleve, Robert Henrysoun, Sir Richard Ros, and various
  anonymous authors; and the number of poems by other authors almost equals
  the number of Chaucer's. The mere accident of the inclusion of a given
  piece in this volume practically tells us nothing, unless it happens to
  be distinctly marked; though we can, of course, often tell the authorship
  from some remark made by Chaucer himself, or by others. And the net
  result is this; that Thynne neither attempted to draw up a list of
  Chaucer's genuine works, nor to exclude such works as were not his. He
  merely printed such things as came to hand, without any attempt at
  selection or observance of order, or regard to authorship. All that we
  can say is, that he did not knowingly exclude any of the genuine pieces.
  Nevertheless, he omitted Chaucer's A.B.C., of which there must have been
  many copies in existence, for we have twelve still extant.</p>

  <p><a name="sect3">§ 3</a>. The mere repetition of this collection, in
  various reprints, did not confer on it any fresh authority. Stowe indeed,
  in 1561, added more pieces to the collection, but he suppressed nothing.
  Neither did he himself exercise much principle of selection; see vol. i.
  p. 56. He even added The Storie of Thebes, which he must have known to be
  Lydgate's. Later reprints were all edited after the same bewildering
  fashion.</p>

  <p><a name="sect4">§ 4</a>. The first person to exercise any
  discrimination in this matter was Thomas Tyrwhitt, who published a new
  edition of the Canterbury Tales in five volumes, 8vo., in 1775-8; being
  the first edition in which some critical care was exercised. After
  Tyrwhitt had printed the Canterbury Tales, accompanied by <!-- Page xi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi"></a>[xi]</span>a most valuable
  commentary in the shape of Notes, it occurred to him to make a Glossary.
  He had not proceeded far before he decided that such a Glossary ought to
  be founded upon the whole of Chaucer's Works, instead of referring to the
  Tales only; since this would alone suffice to shew clearly the nature of
  Chaucer's vocabulary. He at once began to draw up something in the nature
  of a canon. He rejected the works that were marked with the names of
  other poets, and remorselessly swept away a large number of Stowe's very
  casual additions. And, considering that he was unable, at that date, to
  apply any linguistic tests of any value&mdash;that he had no means of
  distinguishing Chaucer's rimes from those of other poets&mdash;that he
  had, in fact, nothing to guide him but his literary instinct and a few
  notes found in the MSS.&mdash;his attempt was a fairly good one. He
  decisively rejected the following poems found in Thynne's edition, viz.
  no. 4 (Testament of Criseyde, by Henrysoun); 11 (The Floure of Curtesie,
  by Lydgate); 13 (La Belle Dame, by Sir R. Ros); 15 (The Assemblee of
  Ladies); 18 (A Praise of Women); 21 (The Lamentacion of Marie
  Magdaleine); 22 (The Remedie of Love); 25 (The Letter of Cupide, by
  Hoccleve); 26 (A Ballade in commendacion of our Ladie, by Lydgate); 27
  (Jhon Gower to Henry IV); 28 and 29 (Sayings of Dan John, by Lydgate); 30
  (Balade de Bon Conseil, by Lydgate); 32 (Balade with Envoy&mdash;O leude
  booke); 33 (Scogan's poem, except the stanzas on Gentilesse); 40 (A
  balade..., by Dan John lidgat); and in no single instance was he wrong in
  his rejection. He also implied that the following had no claim to be
  Chaucer's, as he did not insert them in his final list; viz. no. 6 (A
  goodlie balade of Chaucer); and 38 (Two stanzas&mdash;Go foorthe, kyng);
  and here he was again quite right. It is also obvious that no. 41 (A
  balade in the Praise of Master Geffray Chauser) was written by another
  hand; and indeed, the first line says that Chaucer 'now lith in grave.'
  It will at once be seen that Tyrwhitt did excellent service; for, in
  fact, he eliminated from Thynne's edition no less than nineteen pieces
  out of forty-one; leaving only twenty-two<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> remaining. Of this remainder, if we
  include The Romaunt of the Rose, all but three are unhesitatingly
  accepted by scholars. The three exceptions are nos. 17, 20, and <!-- Page
  xii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii"></a>[xii]</span>31; i.&nbsp;e.
  The Complaint of the Black Knight<a name="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>; The Testament of Love<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>; and The Cuckoo and the Nightingale.</p>

  <p><a name="sect5">§ 5</a>. When Tyrwhitt came to examine the later
  editions, the only other pieces that seemed to him sufficiently good for
  the purpose of being quoted in his Glossary were the six following, viz.
  Chaucer's A.B.C. (in ed. 1602); The Court of Love (in ed. 1561);
  Chaucer's Dreme (in ed. 1598); The Flower and the Leaf (in ed. 1598);
  Proverbes by Chaucer (in ed. 1561); and Chaucer's Words to his Scrivener
  Adam (in ed. 1561). Of these, we may accept the first and the two last;
  but there is no external evidence in favour of the other three. He also
  added that the Virelai (no. 50, in ed. 1561) may 'perhaps' be
  Chaucer's.</p>

  <p><a name="sect6">§ 6</a>. In 1810 we find an edition of Chaucer's
  Works, by A. Chalmers, F.S.A., in the first volume of the 'English
  Poets,' collected in twenty-one volumes. In this edition, some sort of
  attempt was made, for the first time, to separate the spurious from the
  genuine poems. But this separation was made with such reckless
  carelessness that we actually find no less than six poems (nos. 36, 38,
  39, 42, 43, 44, in vol. i. 32, 33, above) printed twice over, once as
  being genuine, and once as being spurious<a name="NtA_5"
  href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. It is obvious that we cannot accept a
  canon of Chaucer's Works of such a character as this.</p>

  <p><a name="sect7">§ 7</a>. In 1845 appeared the edition in which modern
  critics, till quite recently, put all their trust; and no student will
  ever understand what is really meant by 'the canon of Chaucer's Works'
  until he examines this edition with something like common care. It bears
  this remarkable title:&mdash;'The Poetical Works of Geoffrey Chaucer.
  With an Essay on his Language and Versification, and an <!-- Page xiii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii"></a>[xiii]</span>Introductory
  Discourse; together with Notes and a Glossary. By Thomas Tyrwhitt.
  London: Edward Moxon, Dover Street, 1855<a name="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.'</p>

  <p>In this title, which must be most carefully scanned, there is one very
  slight unintentional misprint, which alters its whole character. The stop
  after the word 'Glossary' should have been a comma only. The difference
  in sense is something startling. The title-page was meant to convey that
  the volume contains, (1) The Poetical Works of Geoffrey Chaucer
  (comprising Tyrwhitt's text of the Canterbury Tales, <i>the remaining
  poems being anonymously re-edited</i>); and that it <i>also</i> contains,
  (2) an Essay, a Discourse, Notes, and a Glossary, all by Thomas Tyrwhitt.
  Such are the facts; and such would have been the (possible) sense of the
  title-page, if the comma after 'Glossary' had not been misprinted as a
  full stop. But as the title actually appears, even serious students have
  fallen into the error of supposing that Tyrwhitt edited these Poetical
  Works; an error of the first magnitude, which has produced disastrous
  results. A moment's reflection will shew that, as Tyrwhitt edited the
  Canterbury Tales only, and died in 1786, he could not have edited the
  Poetical Works in 1845, fifty-nine years after his death. It would have
  been better if a short explanation, to this effect, had been inserted in
  the volume; but there is nothing of the kind.</p>

  <p>It must therefore be carefully borne in mind, that this edition of
  1845, on the title-page of which the name of Tyrwhitt is so conspicuous,
  was really edited anonymously, or may even be said not to have been
  edited at all. The Canterbury Tales are reprinted from Tyrwhitt; and so
  also are the Essay, the Discourse, the Notes, and the Glossary; and it is
  most important to observe that 'the Glossary' is preceded by Tyrwhitt's
  'Advertisement,' and by his 'Account of the Works of Chaucer to which
  this Glossary is adapted; and of those other pieces<a name="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> which have been improperly intermixed
  with his in the Editions.' The volume is, in fact, made up in this way.
  Pages i-lxx and 1-209 are all due to Tyrwhitt; and contain a Preface, an
  Appendix to the Preface, an Abstract of Passages of the Life of Chaucer,
  an Essay, an Introductory Discourse to the Tales, and the Tales
  themselves. <!-- Page xiv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexiv"></a>[xiv]</span>Again, pp. 441-502 are all due to
  Tyrwhitt, and contain an Advertisement to the Glossary, an Account of
  Chaucer's Works (as above), and a Glossary. Moreover, this Glossary
  contains a large number of words from most of Chaucer's Works, including
  even his <i>prose</i> treatises; besides a handful of words from spurious
  works such as 'Chaucer's Dream.'</p>

  <p>In this way, all the former part and all the latter part of the volume
  are due to Tyrwhitt; it is the <i>middle part</i> that is wholly
  independent of him. It is here that we find no less than twenty-five
  poems, <i>which he never edited</i>, reprinted (inexactly) from the old
  black-letter editions or from Chalmers. It thus becomes plain that the
  words 'By Thomas Tyrwhitt' on the title-page refer only to the second
  clause of it, but have no reference to the former clause, consisting of
  the words, 'The Poetical Works of Geoffrey Chaucer.' It remains to be
  said that the twenty-five poems which are here appended to the Canterbury
  Tales are well selected; and that the anonymous editor or superintendent
  was guided in his choice by Tyrwhitt's 'Account of the Works.'</p>

  <p><a name="sect8">§ 8</a>. This somewhat tedious account is absolutely
  necessary, every word of it, in order to enable the reader to understand
  what has always been meant (since 1845) by critics who talk about some
  works as being 'attributed to Chaucer.' They really mean (in the case,
  for example, of The Cuckoo and the Nightingale) that it happens to be
  included in a certain volume <i>by an anonymous editor</i>, published in
  1845, in which the suggestions made by Tyrwhitt in 1778 were practically
  adopted without any important deviation. In the case of any other author,
  such a basis for a canon would be considered rather a sandy one; it
  derives its whole value from the fact that Tyrwhitt was an excellent
  literary critic, who may well be excused for a few mistakes, considering
  how much service he did in thus reducing the number of poems in
  'Chaucer's Works' from 64 to little more than 26<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. Really, this was a grand achievement,
  especially as it clearly emphasised the absurdity of trusting to the old
  editions. But it is an abuse of language to say that 'The Cuckoo and
  Nightingale' has 'always been attributed to Chaucer,' merely <!-- Page xv
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexv"></a>[xv]</span>because it
  happens to have been printed by Thynne in 1532, and had the good luck to
  be accepted by Tyrwhitt in 1778. On the contrary, such a piece remains on
  its trial; and it must be rejected absolutely, both on the external and
  on the internal evidence. Externally, because no scribe or early writer
  connects it with him in any way. Internally, for reasons given in vol. i.
  p. 39<a name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>; and for other
  reasons given in Lounsbury's Studies in Chaucer.</p>

  <p><a name="sect9">§ 9</a>. The chief value of the anonymous edition in
  1845 is, that it gave practical expression to Tyrwhitt's views. The later
  editions by Bell and Morris were, in some respects, retrogressive. Both,
  for example, include The Lamentation of Mary Magdalene, which Tyrwhitt
  rightly denounced in no dubious terms; (see vol. i. above, pp. 37, 38).
  But, of late years, the question of constructing a canon of Chaucer's
  genuine works has received proper attention, and has been considered by
  such scholars as Henry Bradshaw, Bernhard ten Brink, Dr. Koch, Dr.
  Furnivall, Professor Lounsbury, and others; with a fairly unanimous
  result. The whole question is well summed up in Lounsbury's Studies in
  Chaucer, Chapter IV, on 'The Writings of Chaucer.' His conclusion is,
  that his 'examination leaves as works about which there is no dispute
  twenty-six titles.' By these titles he means The Canterbury Tales,
  Boethius, Troilus, The House of Fame, The Legend of Good Women, The
  Astrolabe, and the nineteen Minor Poems which I denote by the numbers
  I-XI, XIII-XX (no. XX being counted as <i>two</i>). His examination did
  not at first include no. XII (To Rosemounde); but, in his Appendix (vol.
  iii. pp. 449, 450), he calls attention to it, and accepts it without
  hesitation. He also says of no. XXII, that 'it may be Chaucer's own
  work.'</p>

  <p><a name="sect10">§ 10</a>. I may add a few words about the other Minor
  Poems which I now print, numbered XXI, XXIII, and XXIV-XXVI; the last
  three of which appear in vol. iv. pp. xxv-xxxi.</p>

  <p>As regards no. XXI, or 'Against Women Unconstaunt,' <!-- Page xvi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvi"></a>[xvi]</span>I observe that
  Mr. Pollard, in his 'Chaucer Primer,' has these words. The authenticity
  of this poem 'has lately been reasserted by Prof. Skeat, on the triple
  ground that it is (1) a good poem; (2) perfect in its rhymes<a
  name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>; (3) found in conjunction
  with poems undoubtedly by Chaucer in two MSS.' This account, however,
  leaves out my chief argument, viz. its obvious dependence upon a Ballade
  by Machault, whom Chaucer is known to have imitated, and who is not known
  to have been imitated by any other Englishman. I also lay stress on the
  very peculiar manner in which the poem occurs in MS. Ct. See above, vol.
  i. p. 88. It should also be compared with the Balade to Rosemounde, which
  it resembles in tone. It seems to me that the printing of this poem in an
  Appendix is quite justifiable. We may some day learn more about it.</p>

  <p><a name="sect11">§ 11</a>. As regards no. XXIV (vol. iv. p. xxv), the
  external evidence is explicit. It occurs in the same MS. as that which
  authenticates no. VI (A Compleint to his Lady); and the MS. itself is one
  of Shirley's. Internally, we observe the great peculiarity of the rhythm.
  Not only is the poem arranged in nine-line stanzas, but the whole is a
  <i>tour de force</i>. In the course of 33 lines, there are but 3
  rime-endings; and we may particularly notice the repetition of the first
  two lines at the end of the poem, just as in the Complaint of Anelida,
  which likewise begins and ends with a line in which <i>remembraunce</i>
  is the last word. We have here a specimen of the kind of nine-line stanza
  (examples of which are very scarce) which Hoccleve endeavoured to imitate
  in his Balade to my Lord of York<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>; but Hoccleve had to employ three rimes
  in the stanza instead of two. The poem is chiefly of importance as an
  example of Chaucer's metrical experiments, and as being an excellent
  specimen of a Complaint. There is a particular reason for taking an
  interest in all poems of this character, because few Complaints are
  extant, although Chaucer assures us that he wrote many of them.</p>

  <p><a name="sect12">§ 12</a>. As to the poems numbered XXIII (A Balade of
  Compleynt), XXV (Complaint to my Mortal Foe, vol. iv. p. xxvii), and XXVI
  (Complaint to my Lodesterre, vol. iv. p. xxix), there are two points of
  interest: (1) that they are Complaints, and <!-- Page xvii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvii"></a>[xvii]</span>(2) that they have
  never been printed before. That they are genuine, I have no clear proof
  to offer; but they certainly illustrate this peculiar kind of poem, and
  are of some interest; and it is clearly a convenience to be able to
  compare them with such Complaints as we know to be genuine, particularly
  with no. VI (A Complaint to his Lady). They may be considered as
  relegated to an Appendix, for the purposes of comparison and
  illustration. I do not think I shall be much blamed for thus rendering
  them accessible. It may seem to some that it must be an easy task to
  discover unprinted poems that are reasonably like Chaucer's in
  vocabulary, tone, and rhythm. Those who think so had better take the task
  in hand; they will probably, in any case, learn a good deal that they did
  not know before. The student of original MSS. sees many points in a new
  light; and, if he is capable of it, will learn humility.</p>

<p class="ac"><a name="sect13">§ 13</a>. <span class="sc">The Text of the Canterbury Tales.</span></p>

  <p>On this subject I have already said something above (vol. iv. pp.
  xvii-xx); and have offered a few remarks on the texts in former editions
  (vol. iv. pp. xvi, xvii; cf. p. viii). But I now take the opportunity of
  discussing the matter somewhat further.</p>

  <p>It is unfortunate that readers have hitherto been so accustomed to
  inaccurate texts, that they have necessarily imbibed several erroneous
  notions. I do not hereby intend any reflection upon the editors, as the
  best MSS. were inaccessible to them; and it is only during the last few
  years that many important points regarding the grammar, the
  pronunciation, and the scansion of Middle-English have been sufficiently
  determined<a name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>. Still, the
  fact remains, and is too important to be passed over.</p>

  <p>In particular, I may call attention to the unfortunate prejudice
  against a certain habit of Chaucer's, which it taxed all the ingenuity of
  some of the editors to suppress. Chaucer frequently allows the first foot
  of his verse to consist of a single accented syllable, as has been
  abundantly illustrated above with respect to his Legend of Good Women
  (vol. iii. pp. xliv-xlvii). It was a natural mistake on Tyrwhitt's part
  to attribute the apparent fault to the scribes, and to amend the lines
  which seemed to <!-- Page xviii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexviii"></a>[xviii]</span>be so strangely defective. It will be
  sufficient to enumerate the lines of this character that occur in the
  Prologue, viz. ll. 76, 131, 170, 247, 294, 371, and 391.</p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt alters <i>Al</i> to <i>Alle</i>, meaning no doubt
  <i>Al-le</i> (dissyllabic), which would be ungrammatical. For
  <i>That</i>, he has <i>Thatte</i>, as if for <i>That-te</i>; whereas
  <i>That</i> is invariably a monosyllable. For <i>Gingling</i>, he has
  <i>Gingeling</i>, evidently meant to be lengthened out to a trisyllable.
  For <i>For</i>, he prints <i>As for</i>. For <i>Twenty</i>, he has <i>A
  twenty</i>. The next line is untouched; he clearly took <i>Everich</i> to
  be thoroughly trisyllabic; which may be doubted. For <i>In</i>, he has
  <i>All in</i>. And the same system is applied, throughout all the Tales.
  The point is, of course, that the MSS. do not countenance such
  corrections, but are almost unanimously obstinate in asserting the
  'imperfection' of the lines<a name="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The natural result of altering <i>twenty</i> to <i>A twenty</i> (not
  only here, but again in D. 1695), was to induce the belief in students
  that <i>A twenty bookes</i> is a Chaucerian idiom. I can speak feelingly,
  for I believed it for some years; and I have met with many who have done
  the same<a name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. And the
  unfortunate part of the business is, that the restoration of the true
  reading shocks the reader's sense of propriety. This is to be regretted,
  certainly; but the truth must be told; especially as the true readings of
  the MSS. are now, thanks to the Chaucer Society, accessible to many. The
  student, in fact, has something to unlearn; and he who is most familiar
  with the old texts has to unlearn the most. The restoration of the text
  to the form of it given in the seven best MSS. is, consequently, in a few
  instances, of an almost revolutionary character; and it is best that this
  should be said plainly<a name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>.

  <p>The editions by Wright and Morris do not repeat the above amendments
  by Tyrwhitt; but strictly conform to the Harleian MS. Even so, they are
  not wholly correct; for this MS. blunders over two lines out of the
  seven. It gives l. 247 in this extraordinary form:&mdash;'For to delen
  with such poraile'; where the omission of <i>no</i> renders all scansion
  hopeless. And again, it gives l. 371 in the form:&mdash;'Euery man for
  the wisdom that he can'; which is hardly pleasing. And in a great many
  places, the faithful following of this treacherous MS. has led the
  editors into sad trouble.</p>

  <p><a name="sect14">§ 14</a>. <span class="sc">The Harleian MS.</span>
  The printing of this MS. for the Chaucer Society enables us to see that
  Mr. Wright did not adhere so closely to the text of the MS. as he would
  have us believe. As many readers may not have the opportunity of testing
  this statement for themselves, I here subjoin a few specimens of lines
  from this MS., to shew the nature of its errors.</p>

  cite this line because it is, practically, correct, and agrees with other
  MSS., it being remembered that 'viság-e' is trisyllabic. But readers have
  not, as yet, been permitted to see this line in its correct form. The
  black-letter editions insert <i>sore</i> before <i>aferd</i>. Tyrwhitt
  follows them; Wright follows Tyrwhitt; and Morris follows Wright, but
  prints <i>sore</i> in italics, to shew that there is here a deviation
  from the MS. of some sort or other.</p>

  <p>These examples shew that the Harleian MS. requires very careful
  watching. There is no doubt as to its early age and its frequent
  helpfulness in difficult passages; but it is not the kind of MS. that
  should be greatly trusted.</p>

  <p><a name="sect15">§ 15</a>. <span class="sc">The Ellesmere MS.</span>
  The excellence of this MS. renders the task of editing the Tales much
  easier than that of editing The House of Fame or the Minor Poems. The
  text here given only varies from it in places where variation seemed
  highly desirable, as explained in the footnotes. As to my general
  treatment of it, I have spoken above (vol. iv. pp. xviii-xx).</p>

  <p>One great advantage of this MS., quite apart from the excellence of
  its readings, is the highly phonetic character of the spelling. The
  future editor will probably some day desire to normalise the spelling of
  Chaucer throughout his works. If so, he must very carefully study the
  spelling of the Ellesmere and Hengwrt MSS., which resemble each other
  very closely. By their help, it becomes possible to regulate the use of
  the final <i>e</i> to a very great extent, which is extremely helpful for
  the scansion of the lines.</p>

  <p><a name="sect16">§ 16</a>. This matter is best illustrated by
  referring, for a while, to the old black-letter editions; moreover, the
  whole matter will appear in a clearer light if we consider, at the same
  time, the remarkable argument put forward by Prof. Morley (Eng. Writers,
  v. 126) in favour of the genuineness of The Court of Love. <!-- Page xxi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxi"></a>[xxi]</span></p>

  <p>'Chaucer (he says) could not have written verse that would scan
  without sounding in due place the final <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i>. But when the final <i>e</i> came to be dropped,
  a skilful copyist of later time would have no difficulty whatever in
  making the lines run without it.... If Chaucer wrote&mdash;"But that I
  liké, may I not come by"<a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>&mdash;it was an easy change
  to&mdash;"But that I like, <i>that</i> may I not come by." With <i>so</i>
  or <i>and</i>, or <i>well</i>, or <i>gat</i>, or <i>that</i>, and many a
  convenient monosyllable, lines that seemed short to the later ear were
  readily eked out.' He then proceeds to give a specimen from the beginning
  of the Canterbury Tales, suggesting, by way of example, that l. 9 can
  easily be made to scan in modern fashion by writing&mdash;'And when the
  small fowls maken melodye.'</p>

  <p>Such a theory would be perfectly true, if it had any basis in facts.
  The plain answer is, that later scribes easily <i>might</i> have eked out
  lines which seemed deficient; only, as a matter of fact, they <i>did not
  do so</i>. The notion that Chaucer's lines run smoothly, and can be
  scanned, is quite a modern notion, largely due to Tyrwhitt's common
  sense. The editors of the sixteenth century <i>did not know</i> that
  Chaucer's lines ran smoothly, and did not often attempt to mend them, but
  generally gave them up as hopeless; and we ought to be much obliged to
  them for doing so. Whenever they actually make amendments here and there,
  the patching is usually plain enough. The fact is, however, that they
  commonly let the texts alone; so that if they followed a good MS., the
  lines will frequently scan, not by their help, but as it were in spite of
  them.</p>

  <p><a name="sect17">§ 17</a>. Let us look for a moment, at the very
  edition by Stowe (in 1561), which contains the earliest copy of The Court
  of Love. The 9th line of the tales runs thus:&mdash;'And smale fowles
  maken melodie,' which is sufficiently correct. We can scan it now in the
  present century, but it is strongly to be suspected that Stowe could not,
  and did not care to try. For this is how he presents some of the
  lines.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Redie to go in my pilgrimage; A. 21.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>For him, <i>wenden</i> or <i>wende</i> was a monosyllable; and
  <i>go</i> would do just as well.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The chambres and stables weren wyde; A. 28.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He omits <i>the</i> before <i>stables</i>; it did not matter to him.
  So that, <!-- Page xxii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxii"></a>[xxii]</span>instead of <i>filling up</i> an
  imperfect line, as Prof. Morley says he would be sure to do, he leaves a
  gap.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>To tel you al the condicion; A. 38.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Tel</i> should be <i>tel-le</i>. As it is, the line halts. But
  where is the filling up by the help of some convenient monosyllable?</p>

  <p>I add a few more examples, from Stowe, without comment.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For to tell you of his aray; A. 73.</p>
      <p>In hope to stande in his ladyes grace; A. 88.</p>

      <p>Her mouth smale, and therto softe and reed; A. 153.</p>

      <p>His barge was called the Maudelain; A. 410.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is needless to proceed; it is obvious that Stowe was not the man
  who would care to eke out a line by filling it up with convenient
  monosyllables. And it is just because these old editors usually let the
  text alone, that the old black-letter editions still retain a certain
  value, and represent some lost manuscript.</p>

  <p><a name="sect18">§ 18</a>. One editor, apparently Speght, actually had
  an inkling of the truth; but he was promptly put down by Dryden (Pref. to
  the Fables). 'The verse of Chaucer, I confess, is not harmonious to us;
  ... there is the rude sweetness of a Scotch tune in it, which is natural
  and pleasing, though not perfect. It is true, I cannot go so far as he
  who published the last edition of him; for he would make us believe the
  fault is in our ears, and that there were really ten syllables in a verse
  where we find but nine; but this error is not worth confuting; it is so
  gross and obvious an error<a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>, that common sense (which is a rule in
  everything but matters of faith and revelation) must convince the reader,
  that equality of numbers in every verse which we call Heroic, was either
  not known, or not always practised in Chaucer's age. It were an easy
  matter to produce some thousands of verses, which are lame for want of
  half a foot, and sometimes a whole one, and which no pronunciation can
  make otherwise.' We cannot doubt that such was the prevalent opinion at
  that time. <!-- Page xxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect19">§ 19</a>. For such readers as do not wish to study
  the language or the grammar of Chaucer, but merely wish to read the text
  with some degree of comfort, and to come by the stories and their general
  literary expression with the least possible trouble, the Ellesmere MS.
  furnishes quite an ideal text. Such a reader has only to observe the
  following empirical rules<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>1. Pronounce every final <i>e</i> like the final <i>a</i> in
  <i>China</i>, except in a few very common words like <i>wolde</i>,
  <i>sholde</i>, <i>were</i>, and the like, which may be read as
  <i>wold'</i>, <i>shold'</i>, <i>wer'</i>, unless the metre seems to
  demand that they should be fully pronounced. The commonest clipped words
  of this character are <i>have</i>, <i>hadde</i> (when a mere auxiliary),
  <i>were</i>, <i>nere</i> (were not), <i>wolde</i>, <i>nolde</i> (would
  not), <i>thise</i> (like mod. E. <i>these</i>), <i>othere</i>, and a few
  others, that are easily picked up by observation.</p>

  <p>2. Always pronounce final <i>-ed</i>, <i>-es</i>, <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i>, as distinct syllables, unless it is
  particularly convenient to clip them. Such extra syllables, like the
  final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>, are especially to be preserved
  at the end of the line; a large number of the rimes being double (or
  feminine).</p>

  <p>3. But the final <i>-e</i> is almost invariably elided, and other
  light syllables, especially <i><span class="nw">-en</span></i>, <i><span
  class="nw">-er</span></i>, <i><span class="nw">-el</span></i>, are
  frequently treated as being redundant, whenever the next word following
  begins with a vowel or is one of the words (beginning with <i>h</i>) in
  the following list, viz. <i>he</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>him</i>, <i>her</i>,
  <i>hir</i> (their), <i>hem</i> (them), <i>hath</i>, <i>hadde</i>,
  <i>have</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>heer</i>.</p>

  <p>These three simple rules will go a long way. An attentive reader will
  thus catch the swing of the metre, and will be carried along almost
  mechanically. The chief obstacle to a succession of smooth lines is the
  jerk caused by the occasional occurrence of a line defective in the first
  foot, as explained above. Perhaps it may be further noted that an
  <i>e</i> sometimes occurs, as a distinct syllable, in the middle of a
  word as well as at the end of it. Exx.: <i>Eng-e-lond</i> (A. 16);
  <i>wod-e-craft</i> (A. 110); <i>sem-e-ly</i> (A. 136).</p>

  <p><a name="sect20">§ 20</a>. We must also remember that the accentuation
  of many words, especially of such as are of French origin, was quite
  different then from what it is now. A word like 'reason' was then
  properly pronounced <i>resóun</i> (rezuun), i.&nbsp;e. somewhat like a modern
  <i>ray-zóon</i>; but even in Chaucer's day the habit of throwing back the
  accent was beginning to prevail, and there was a tendency to <!-- Page
  xxiv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>say
  <i>réson</i> (reezun), somewhat like a modern <i>ráy-zun</i>. Chaucer
  avails himself of this variable accent, and adopts the sound which comes
  in more conveniently at the moment<a name="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>. Thus while we find <i>resóun</i>
  (rezuun) in l. 37, in l. 274 we find résons (reezunz).</p>

  <p><a name="sect21">§ 21</a>. I give a few examples of the three rules
  stated above.</p>

  <p>The following words are properly dissyllabic, in the Prologue to the
  Canterbury Tales:&mdash;(l. 1) <i>shou-res</i>, <i>so-te</i>; (2)
  <i>drogh-te</i>, <i>Mar-che</i>, <i>per-ced</i>, <i>ro-te</i>; (3)
  <i>ba-thed</i>, <i>vey-ne</i>; (5) <i>swe-te</i>; (7) <i>crop-pes</i>,
  <i>yon-ge</i>, <i>son-ne</i>; (8) <i>half-e</i>; (9) <i>sma-le</i>,
  <i>fow-les</i>, <i>ma-ken</i>; (10) <i>sle-pen</i>, <i>o-pen</i>,
  <i>y-ë</i>; (13) <i>straun-ge</i>, <i>strond-es</i>; (14) <i>fer-ne</i>,
  <i>hal-wes</i>, <i>lon-des</i>; (15) <i>shi-res</i>, <i>end-e</i>; and so
  on.</p>

  <p>In the same way, there are three syllables in (1) <i>A-pril-le</i>;
  (4) <i>en-gend-red</i>; (5) <i>Zéph-i-rús</i>; (6) <i>In-spi-red</i>; (8)
  <i>y-ron-ne</i>; &amp;c. And there are four syllables in (9)
  <i>mél-o-dý-ë</i>; (12) <i>pil-grim-á-ges</i>.</p>

  <p>Elision takes place of the <i>e</i> in <i>drogh-te</i> and of the
  <i>e</i> in <i>couth-e</i> in l. 14; of the <i>e</i> in <i>nyn-e</i> in
  l. 24; &amp;c. In such cases, the words may be read as if spelt
  <i>droght</i>, <i>couth</i>, <i>nyn</i>, for convenience. There are some
  cases in which the scribe actually fails to write a final <i>e</i>, owing
  to such elision; but they are not common. I have noted a few in the
  Glossarial Index.</p>

  <p>The final <i>e</i> is ignored, before a consonant, in <i>were</i> (59,
  68, 74, 81); and even, which is not common, in <i>hope</i> (88) and
  <i>nose</i> (152).</p>

  <p>As examples of accents to which we are no longer accustomed, we may
  notice <i>A-príl-le</i> (1); <i>ver-tú</i> (4); <i>cor-á-ges</i> (11);
  <i>á-ven-túre</i> (25); <i>tó-ward</i> (27); <i>re-sóun</i> (37);
  <i>hon-óur</i> (46); <i>hon-óur-ed</i> (50); <i>a-ry´-ve</i> (60);
  <i>sta-tú-re</i> (83); <i>Cur-téys</i> (99).</p>

  <p>The lines were recited deliberately, with a distinct pause near the
  middle of each, at which no elision could take place. At this medial
  pause there is often a redundant syllable (as is more fully explained in
  vol. vi). Thus, in l. 3, the <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> in
  <i>veyn-e</i> should be preserved, though modern readers are sure to
  ignore it. Cf. <i>carie</i> in l. 130; <i>studie</i> in l. 184;
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect22">§ 22</a>. By help of the above hints, some notion of
  the melody of Chaucer may be gained, even by such as adopt the modern
  English pronunciation. It is right, however, to bear in mind that most of
  the vowels had, at that time, much the same powers as in modern French
  and Italian; and it sometimes makes a <!-- Page xxv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxv"></a>[xxv]</span>considerable
  difference. Thus the word <i>charitable</i> in l. 143 was really
  pronounced more like the modern French <i>charitable</i>; only that the
  initial sound was that of the O. F. and E. <i>ch</i>, as in
  <i>church</i>, not that of the modern French <i>ch</i> in <i>cher</i>.
  For further remarks on the pronunciation, see vol. vi.</p>

  <p><a name="sect23">§ 23</a>. The feeble suggestion is sometimes made
  that Chaucer's spelling ought to be modernised, like that of Shakespeare.
  This betrays a total ignorance of the history of English spelling. It is
  not strictly the case, that Shakespeare's spelling has been modernised;
  for the fact is the other way, viz. that in all that is most essential,
  it is the spelling of Shakespeare's time that has been adopted in modern
  English. The so-called 'modern' spelling is really a survival, and is
  sadly unfit, as we all know to our cost, for representing modern English
  sounds. By 'modernising,' such critics usually mean the cutting off of
  final <i>e</i> in places where it was just as little required in
  Elizabethan English as it is now; the freër use of 'v' and of 'j'; and so
  forth; nearly all of the alterations referring to unessential details.
  Such alterations would have been useful even in Shakespeare's time, and
  would not have touched the character of the spelling. But the spelling of
  Chaucer's time refers to quite a different age, when a large number of
  inflections were still in use that have since been discarded; so that it
  involves changes in essential and vital points. As it happens, the
  spelling of the Ellesmere MS. is phonetic in a very high degree.
  Pronounce the words <i>as they are spelt</i>, but with the Italian
  vowel-sounds and the German final <i>e</i>, and you come very near the
  truth. If this is too much trouble, pronounce the words <i>as they are
  spelt</i>, with modern English vowels (usually adding a final <i>e</i>,
  pronounced like <i>a</i> in <i>China</i>, when it is visibly present);
  and, even so, it is easy to follow. The alteration of a word like
  <i>quene</i> to <i>queene</i> does not make it any easier; and the
  further alteration to <i>queen</i> destroys its dissyllabic nature.
  Besides, those who want the spelling modernised can get it in Gilfillan's
  edition.</p>

  <p>Surely, it is better to stick to the true old phonetic spelling. Boys
  at school, who have learnt Attic Greek, are supposed to be able to face
  the spelling of Homer without wincing, though it is not their native
  language; and the number of Englishwomen who are fairly familiar with
  Middle-English is becoming considerable.</p>

  <p><a name="sect24">§ 24</a>. As regards the Notes in the present volume,
  it will be <!-- Page xxvi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>readily understood that I have copied
  them or collected them from many sources. Many of those on the Prologue
  and Knightes Tale were really written by Dr. Morris; but, owing to the
  great kindness he shewed me in allowing me to work in conjunction with
  him on terms of equality, I should often be hard put to it to say which
  they are. A large number are taken from the editions by Tyrwhitt, Wright,
  and Bell; but these are usually acknowledged. Others I have adopted from
  the various works published by the Chaucer Society; from the excellent
  notes by Dr. Köppell, Dr. Kölbing, and Dr. Koch that have appeared in
  Anglia, and in similar publications; and from Professor Lounsbury's
  excellent work entitled Studies in Chaucer. I have usually endeavoured to
  point out the sources of my information; and, if I have in several cases
  failed to do this, I hope it will be understood that, as Chaucer's fox
  said, 'I dide it in no wikke entente.' Perhaps this may seem an unlucky
  reference, for the fox was not speaking the strict truth, as we all know
  that he ought to have done. If I may take any credit for any part of the
  Notes, I think it may be for my endeavour to hunt up, as far as I could,
  a large number of the very frequent allusions to Le Roman de la Rose<a
  name="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>, and to such authors as
  Ovid and Statius; besides undertaking the more difficult task involved in
  tracing out some of the mysterious references which occur in the margins
  of the manuscripts. For the Tale of Melibeus, I naturally derived much
  help and comfort from the admirable edition of Albertano's Liber
  Consolationis by Thor Sundby, and the careful notes made by Mätzner. As
  for the references in the Persones Tale, I should never have found out so
  many of them, but for the kind assistance of the Rev. E. Marshall. To all
  my predecessors in the task of annotation, and to all helpers, I beg
  leave to express my hearty thanks. For further remarks on this and some
  other subjects, see vol. vi.</p>

  <p>As it frequently happens that it is highly desirable to be able to
  recover speedily the whereabouts of a note on some particular word or
  subject, an Index to the Notes is appended to this volume. <!-- Page

  important. The reading should here be <i>terved</i>, not <i>torned</i>;
  and again, in G 1274, read <i>terve</i>, not <i>torne</i>. The Ellesmere
  MS. is really right in both places, though <i>terued</i> appears as
  <i>terned</i> in the Six-text edition. These readings are duly noted in
  the Errata to vol. iv, at p. xxvi. The verb <i>terve</i> means 'to
  strip,' or 'to roll back' the edge of a cuff or the like. The Bremen
  Wörterbuch has: '<i>um tarven, up tarven</i>, den Rand von einem
  Kleidungstücke umschlagen, das innerste auswärts kehren.' Hence read
  <i>tirueden</i> in Havelok, 603; <i>teruen of</i> in the Wars of
  Alexander, 4114; <i>tyrue</i> in Allit. Poems, ed. Morris, B. 630; and

  <p>'When that April, with his sweet showers.' <i>Aprille</i> is here
  masculine, like Lat. <i>Aprilis</i>; cf. l. 5.</p>

  <p><i>shoures</i> (shuu·rez), showers; pl. of <i>shour</i>, A.S.
  <i>sc&#x16B;r</i> (skuur). The etymology of all words of this character,
  which are still in use, can be found by looking out the modern form of
  the word in my Etymological Dictionary. I need not repeat such
  information here.</p>

  <p><i>sote</i>, sweet, is another form of <i>swete</i>, which occurs just
  below in l. 5. The <i>e</i> is not, in this case, the mark of the plural,
  as the forms <i>sote</i>, <i>swete</i> are dissyllabic, and take a final
  <i>e</i> in the singular also. <i>Sote</i> is a less correct form of
  <i>swote</i>; and the variation between the long <i>o</i> in <i>swote</i>
  and the long <i>e</i> in <i>swete</i> is due to confusion between the
  adverbial and adjectival uses. <i>Swote</i> corresponds to A.S.
  <i>sw&#x14D;t</i>, adv., sweetly, and <i>swete</i> to A.S.
  <i>sw&#x113;te</i>, adj., sweet. The latter exhibits mutation of
  <i>&#x14D;</i> to <i>&#x113;</i>; cf. mod. E. <i>goose</i>, pl.
  <i>geese</i> (A.S. <i>g&#x14D;s</i>, pl. <i>g&#x113;s</i>).</p>

  <p>In this Introduction, Chaucer seems to have had in his mind the <!--
  Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[2]</span>passage
  which begins Book IV. of Guido delle Colonne's Historia Troiae, which is
  as follows:&mdash;'Tempus erat quo sol maturans sub obliquo zodiaci
  circulo cursum suum sub signo iam intrauerat Arietis ... celebratur
  equinoxium primi veris, tunc cum incipit tempus blandiri mortalibus in
  aeris serenitate intentis, tunc cum dissolutis ymbribus Zephiri flantes
  molliciter (<i>sic</i>) crispant aquas ... tunc cum ad summitates arborum
  et ramorum humiditates ex terre gremio examplantes extollunt in eis;
  quare insultant semina, crescunt segetes, virent prata, variorum colorum
  floribus illustrata ... tunc cum ornatur terra graminibus, cantant
  volucres, et in dulcis armonie modulamine citharizant. Tunc quasi medium
  mensis Aprilis effluxerat'; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>We may also note the passage in Vincent of Beauvais, <i>Speculum
  Naturale</i>, lib. xv. c. 66, entitled <i>De Vere</i>:&mdash;'Sol vero ad
  radices herbarum et arborum penetrans, humorem quem ibi coadunatum hyeme
  reperit, attrahit; herba vero, vel arbor suam inanitionem sentiens a
  terra attrahit humorem, quem ibi sui similitudine adiuuante calore Solis
  transmutat, sicque reuiuiscit; inde est quod quidam mensis huius temporis
  <i>Aprilis</i> dicitur, quia tunc terra praedicto modo aperitur.'</p>

  <p>2. <i>droght-e</i>, dryness; A. S. <i>dr&#x16B;gathe</i>; essentially
  dissyllabic, but the final <i>e</i> is elided. Pron. (druuht').
  <i>perced</i>, pierced, <i>rot-e</i>, dat. of <i>root</i>, a root; Icel.
  <i>r&#x14D;t</i>; written for <i>roote</i>. The double <i>o</i> is not
  required to shew vowel-length, when a single consonant and an <i>e</i>
  follow.</p>

  <p>4. <i>vertu</i>, efficacy, productive agency, vital energy. 'And
  bathed every vein (of the tree or herb) in such moisture, by means of
  which quickening power the flower is generated.' Pron. (vertü').</p>

  <p>5. <i>Zephirus</i>, the zephyr, or west wind. Cf. Chaucer's Book of
  the Duchess, l. 402, and the note. There are two more references to
  Zephirus in the translation of Boethius, bk. i. met. 5; bk. ii. met.
  3.</p>

  <p>6. <i>holt</i>, wood, grove; A. S. <i>holt</i>; cf. G.
  <i>Holz</i>.</p>

  <p>7. <i>croppes</i>, shoots, extremities of branches, especially towards
  the top of a tree; hence simply tree-tops, tops of plants, &amp;c. Hence
  <i>to crop</i> is 'to cut the tops off.' Cf. A. 1532; tr. of Boethius,
  bk. iii. met. 2. 24; Rom. Rose, 1396; and note to P. Plowman, B. xvi.
  69.</p>

  <p><i>yonge sonne</i> (yungg&#x259; sunn&#x259;); see the next note. The
  <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> in <i>yong-e</i> denotes the definite
  form of the article. <i>Sonn-e</i>, A.&nbsp;S. <i>sunna</i>, is essentially
  dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>8. <i>the Ram.</i> The difficulty here really resides in the
  expression 'his halfe cours,' which means what it says, viz. 'his
  half-course,' and not, as Tyrwhitt unfortunately supposed, 'half his
  course.' The results of the two explanations are quite different. Taking
  Chaucer's own expression as it stands, he tells us that, a little past
  the middle of April, 'the young sun has run his half-course in the Ram.'
  Turning to Fig. 1 in The Astrolabe (see vol. iii.), we see that, against
  the month 'Aprilis,' there appears in the circle of zodiacal signs, the
  <i>latter</i> half (roughly speaking) of Aries, and the <i>former</i>
  half of Taurus. Thus the sun in April runs a half-course in the Ram and a
  half-course in the Bull. 'The former of these was completed,' says the
  poet; which is as much <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>[3]</span>as to say, that <i>it was past the eleventh of
  April</i>; for, in Chaucer's time, the sun entered Aries on March 12, and
  left that sign on April 11. See note to l. 1.</p>

  <p>The sun had, in fact, only just completed his course through the first
  of the twelve signs, as the said course was supposed to begin at the
  vernal equinox. This is why it is called 'the yonge sonne,' an expression
  which Chaucer repeats under similar circumstances in the Squyeres Tale,
  F. 385. <i>Y-ronne</i>, for A.&nbsp;S. <i>gerunnen</i>, pp. of <i>rinnan</i>,
  to run (M. E. <i>rinnen</i>, <i>rinne</i>). The M.&nbsp;E. <i>y-</i>, A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>ge-</i>, is a mere prefix, mostly used with past participles.</p>

  <p>9. Pron. (&#x259;nd smaa·l&#x259; fuu·lez maa·ken melodii·&#x259;);
  'and little birds make melody.' Cf. <i>fowel</i> (fuul), a bird, in l.
  190.</p>

  <p>10. <i>open ye</i>, open eye. Cf. the modern expression 'with one eye
  open.' This line is copied in the Sowdone of Babylon, ll. 41-46.</p>

  <p>11. 'So nature excites them, in their feelings (instincts).'
  <i>hir</i>, their; A. S. <i>hira</i>, lit. 'of them,' gen. pl. of
  <i>h&#x113;</i>, he. <i>corage</i> (kuraa·j&#x259;); mod. E. courage; see
  l. 22.</p>

  <p>12, 13. According to ordinary English construction, the verb
  <i>longen</i> must be supplied after <i>palmers</i>. In fact, l. 13 is
  parenthetical. Note that <i>Than</i>, in l. 12, answers to <i>Whan</i> in
  l. 1.</p>

  <p>13. <i>palmer</i>, originally, one who made a pilgrimage to the Holy
  Land and brought home a <i>palm</i><span class="nw">-branch</span> as a
  token. Chaucer, says Tyrwhitt, seems to consider all pilgrims to foreign
  parts as palmers. The essential difference between the two classes of
  persons here mentioned, the palmer and the pilgrim, was, that the latter
  had 'some dwelling-place, a palmer had none; the pilgrim travelled to
  some certain place, the palmer to all, and not to any one in particular;
  the pilgrim might go at his own charge, the palmer must profess wilful
  poverty; the pilgrim might give over his profession, the palmer must be
  constant'; Blount's Glossographia (taken from Speght). See note to P.
  Plowman, B. v. 523.</p>

  <p>The fact is, that palmers did not always reach the Holy Land. They
  commonly went to Rome first, where not unfrequently the Pope 'allowed
  them to wear the palm as if they had visited Palestine'; Rock, Church of
  our Fathers, vol. iii. pt. 1. p. 439.</p>

  <p><i>to seken</i>, to seek; the A. S. gerund, <i>t&#x14D;
  s&#x113;canne</i>; expressive of purpose. <i>strondes</i>, strands,
  shores.</p>

  <p>14. <i>ferne halwes</i>, distant saints, i.&nbsp;e. shrines. Here
  <i>ferne</i> = <i>ferrene</i> = distant, foreign. 'To <i>ferne</i>
  poeples'; Chaucer's Boethius, bk. ii. met. 7. See Mätzner's M.&nbsp;E. Dict.
  <i>Ferne</i> also means 'ancient,' but not here.</p>

  <p><i>halwes</i>, saints; cf. Scotch <i>Hallow-e'en</i>, the eve of All
  Hallows, or All Saints; the word is here applied to their shrines.</p>

  <p>Chaucer has, 'to go seken <i>halwes</i>,' to go (on a pilgrimage) to
  seek <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>[4]</span>saints' shrines; D. 657. <i>couthe</i>
  (kuudh'), well known; A.&nbsp;S. <i>c&#x16B;ð</i>, known, pp. of
  <i>cunnan</i>, to know. <i>sondry</i> (sun·dri), various.</p>

  <p>16. <i>wende</i>, go; pret. <i>wente</i>, Eng. <i>went</i>. The use of
  the present tense in modern English is usually restricted to the phrase
  'he <i>wends</i> his way.'</p>

  <p>17. <i>The holy blisful martir</i>, Thomas à Becket. On pilgrimages,
  see Saunders, Chaucer, p. 10; and Erasmus, <i>Peregrinatio religionis
  ergo</i>. There were numerous places in England sought by pilgrims, as
  Durham, St. Alban's, Bury, St. David's, Glastonbury, Lincoln, York,
  Peterborough, Winchester, Holywell, &amp;c.; but the chief were
  Canterbury and Walsingham.</p>

  <p>18. <i>holpen</i>, pp. of <i>helpen</i>. The older preterites of this
  verb are <i>heolp</i>, <i>help</i>, <i>halp</i>. <i>seke</i>, sick, rimes
  to <i>seke</i>, seek; this apparent repetition is only allowed when the
  repeated word is used in two different senses.</p>

  <p><i>seke</i>, pl. of <i>seek</i>, A.&nbsp;S. <i>s&#x113;oc</i>, sick, ill.
  For <i>hem</i>, see n. to l. 175.</p>

  <p>19. <i>Bifel</i>, it befell. <i>seson</i> (saesun), time. <i>on a
  day</i>, one day.</p>

  <p>20. <i>Tabard</i>. Of this word Speght gives the following account in
  his Glossary to Chaucer:&mdash;'Tabard&mdash;a jaquet or sleveless coate,
  worne in times past by noblemen in the warres, but now only by heraults
  (heralds), and is called theyre "coate of armes in servise." It is the
  signe of an inne in Southwarke by London, within the which was the
  lodging of the Abbot of Hyde by Winchester. This is the hostelry where
  <i>Chaucer</i> and the other pilgrims mett together, and, with Henry
  Baily their hoste, accorded about the manner of their journey to
  Canterbury. And whereas through time it hath bin much decayed, it is now
  by Master <i>J. Preston</i>, with the Abbot's house thereto adgoyned,
  newly repaired, and with convenient rooms much encreased, for the receipt
  of many guests.' The inn is well described in Saunders (on Chaucer), p.
  13. See also Stow, Survey of London (ed. Thoms, p. 154); Nares' Glossary,
  s.&nbsp;v. <i>Tabard</i>; Dyce's Skelton, ii. 283; Furnivall's Temporary
  Preface to Chaucer, p. 18.</p>

  <p>The tabard, however, was <i>not</i> sleeveless, though the sleeves, at
  first, were very short. See the plate in Boutell's Heraldry, ed. Aveling,
  p. 69; cf. note to P. Plowman, C. vii. 203.</p>

  <p><i>lay</i>; used like the modern 'lodged,' or 'was stopping.'</p>

  <p>23. <i>come</i> (kum'), short for <i>comen</i>, pp. of <i>comen</i>.
  <i>hostelrye</i>, a lodging, inn, house, residence. <i>Hostler</i>
  properly signifies the keeper of an inn, and not, as now, the servant of
  an inn who looks after the horses.</p>

  <p>24. <i>wel</i> is here used like our word, <i>full</i> or
  <i>quite</i>.</p>

  <p>25. <i>by aventure y-falle</i>, by adventure (chance) fallen (into
  company). Pron. (av·entü·r').</p>

  <p>26. <i>felawshipe</i>, company; from M.&nbsp;E. <i>felawe</i>, companion,
  fellow.</p>

  <p>27. <i>wolden ryde</i>, wished to ride. The latter verb is in the
  infinitive mood, as usual after <i>will</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>shall</i>,
  <i>may</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>29. <i>esed atte beste</i>, accommodated or entertained in the best
  manner. <i>Easement</i> is still used as a law term, signifying
  accommodation. Cf. F. <i>bien aise</i>. Pron. (aezed). <!-- Page 5
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>[5]</span></p>

  <p><i>atte</i>, i.&nbsp;e. at the, was shortened from <i>atten</i>, masc. and
  neut., from A. S. <i>æt th&#x101;m</i>. We also find M.&nbsp;E. <i>atter</i>,
  fem., from A.&nbsp;S. <i>æt th&#x1E3;re</i>.</p>

  <p>30. <i>to reste</i>, i.&nbsp;e. gone to rest, set.</p>

  <p>31. <i>everichon</i>, for <i>ever-ich oon</i>, every one, lit. ever
  each one.</p>

  <p>32. <i>of hir felawshipe</i>, (one) of their company.</p>

  <p>33. <i>forward</i>, agreement. 'Fals was here <i>foreward</i> so forst
  is in May,' i.&nbsp;e. their agreement was as false as a frost in May;
  Ritson's Ancient Songs, i. 30. A.&nbsp;S. <i>fore-weard</i>, lit. 'fore ward,'
  a precaution, agreement.</p>

  <p>34. <i>ther as I yow devyse</i>, to that place that I tell you of (sc.
  Canterbury); <i>ther</i> in M.&nbsp;E. frequently signifies 'where,' and
  <i>ther as</i> signifies 'where that.' <i>devyse</i>, speak of, describe;
  lit. 'devise.'</p>

  <p>35. <i>natheles</i>, nevertheless; lit. 'no the less'; cf. A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>n&#x101;</i>, no. <i>whyl</i>, whilst. The form in <i><span
  class="nw">-es</span></i> (<i>whiles</i>, the reading of some MSS.) is a
  comparatively modern adverbial form, and may be compared with M. E.
  <i>hennes</i>, <i>thennes</i>, hence, thence; <i>ones</i>, <i>twyes</i>,
  <i>thryes</i>, once, twice, thrice; of which older forms are found in
  <i><span class="nw">-enne</span></i> and <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i> respectively.</p>

  <p>37. 'It seemeth to me it is reasonable.'</p>

  <p><i>Me thinketh</i> = <i>me thinks</i>, where <i>me</i> is the dative
  before the impersonal vb. <i>thinken</i>, to appear, seem; cp. <i>me
  liketh</i>, <i>me list</i>, it pleases me. So the phrase <i>if you
  please</i> = if it <i>please you</i>, you being the <i>dative</i> and not
  the nominative case. <i>semed me</i> = it seemed to me, occurs in l. 39.
  The personal verb is properly <i>thenken</i>, as in the Clerkes Tale, E.
  116, 641; or <i>thenchen</i>, as in A. 3253.</p>

  <p><i>accordaunt</i>, accordant, suitable, agreeable (to).</p>

  <p>40. <i>whiche</i>, what sort of men; Lat. <i>qualis</i>.</p>

  <p>41. <i>inne.</i> In M. E., <i>in</i> is the preposition, and
  <i>inne</i> the adverb.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Knight.</b></p>

  <p>43. <i>Knight.</i> It was a common thing in this age for knights to
  seek employment in foreign countries which were at war. Cf. Book of the
  Duchesse, 1024, and my note. Tyrwhitt cites from Leland's
  <i>Itinerary</i>, v. iii. p. cxi., the epitaph of a knight of this
  period, Matthew de Gourney, who had been at the battle of Benamaryn, at
  the siege of Algezir, and at the Battles of Crecy, Poitiers, &amp;c. See
  note to l. 51.</p>

  <p><i>worthy</i>, worthy, is here used in its literal signification of
  distinguished, honourable. See ll. 47, 50. Pron. (wur·dhi).</p>

  <p>For notes on the dresses, &amp;c. of the pilgrims, see Todd's
  Illustrations of Chaucer, p. 227; Fairholt's Costume in England, 1885, i.
  129; and Saunders, on the Canterbury Tales, where some of the MS.
  drawings are reproduced. Also Warton, Hist. Eng. Poetry, sect. 17.</p>

  <p>45. <i>chivalrye</i> (chiv·alrii·&#x259;), knighthood; also the
  manners, exercises, and exploits of a knight.</p>

  <p>47. <i>in his lordes werre</i>, i.&nbsp;e. in the king's service. 'The
  knight, by his tenure, was obliged to serve the king on horseback in his
  wars, and maintain a soldier at his own proper charge,' &amp;c.; Strutt,
  Manners and Customs, iii. 15. <i>werre</i>, war. <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[6]</span></p>

  <p>48. <i>therto</i>, moreover, besides that; see l. 153 below,
  <i>ferre</i>, the comp. of <i>fer</i>, far. Cf. M.&nbsp;E. <i>derre</i>,
  dearer (A. 1448); <i>sarre</i>, sorer, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>49. <i>hethenesse</i>, heathen lands, as distinguished from
  <i>Cristendom</i>, Christian countries. The same distinction occurs in
  English Gilds, ed. Toulmin Smith, p. 36, l. 1.</p>

  <p>50. Pron. (&#x259;nd ae·vr onuu·red for iz wur·dhines·s&#x259;).</p>

  <p>51. <i>Alisaundre</i>, in Egypt, 'was won, and immediately after
  abandoned in 1365, by Pierre de Lusignan, King of Cyprus'; Tyrwhitt.
  Froissart (Chron. bk. iii. c. 22) gives the epitaph of Pierre de
  Lusignan, king of Cyprus, who 'conquered in battle ... the cities of
  Alexandria in Egypt, Tripoli in Syria, Layas in Armenia, Satalia in
  Turkey, with several other cities and towns, from the enemies of the
  faith of Jesus Christ'; tr. by Johnes, vol. ii. p. 138. 'To this I may
  add, from "Les Tombeaux des Chevaliers du noble Ordre de la Toison d'Or,"
  the exploits recorded on a monument also of a French knight, who lived in
  Chaucer's age, and died in 1449, Jean, Seigneur de Roubais, &amp;c. "qui
  en son temps visita les Saints lieux de Ierusalem, ... S. Iacques en
  Galice, ... et passa les perils mortels de plusieurs batailles arrestées
  contre les Infidels, c'est a sçavoir en Hongrie et Barbarie, ... en
  Prusse contre les Letaux, ... avec plusieurs autres faicts exercice
  d'armes tant par mer que par terre,"' &amp;c.&mdash;Todd, Illust. of Ch.,
  p. 227. <i>wonne</i> (wunn&#x259;), won.</p>

  <p>52. <i>he hadde the bord bigonne.</i> Here <i>bord</i> = board, table,
  so that the phrase signifies 'he had been placed at the head of the dais,
  or <i>table</i> of state.' Warton, in his Hist. of Eng. Poetry, ed. 1840,
  ii. 209 (ed. 1871, ii. 373), aptly cites a passage from Gower which is
  quite explicit as to the sense of the phrase. See Gower, Conf. Amantis,
  bk. viii. ed. Pauli, iii. 299. We there read that a knight was honoured
  by a king, by being set at the head of the middle table in the hall.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And he, <i>which had his prise deserved</i>,</p>
      <p>After the kinges owne word,</p>
      <p>Was maad <i>beginne a middel bord</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The context shews that this was at supper-time, and that the knight
  was placed in this honourable position by the marshal of the hall.</p>

  <p>Further illustrations are also given by Warton, ed. 1840, i. 174,
  footnote, shewing that the phrases <i>began the dese</i> (daïs) and
  <i>began the table</i> were also in use, with the same sense. I can add
  another clear instance from Sir Beves of Hamptoun, ed. Kölbing, E. E. T.
  S., p. 104, where we find in one text (l. 2122)&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>53, 54. <i>Pruce.</i> When our English knights wanted employment, 'it
  was usual for them to go and serve in Pruce, or Prussia, with the knights
  of the Teutonic order, who were in a state of constant warfare with their
  heathen neighbours in <i>Lettow</i> (Lithuania), <i>Ruce</i> (Russia),
  and elsewhere.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. Cf. Gower, Conf. Amant. ii. 56.</p>

  <p>The larger part of Lithuania now belongs to Russia, and the remainder
  to Prussia; but in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the natives
  long maintained their independence against the Russians and Poles (Haydn,

  <p><i>reysed</i>, made a military expedition. The O. F. <i>reise</i>,
  sb., a military expedition, was in common use on the continent at that
  time. Numerous examples of its use are given in Godefroy's O.&nbsp;F. Dict. It
  was borrowed from O. H. G. <i>reisa</i> (G. <i>Reise</i>), an expedition.
  Pron. (reized).</p>

  <p>Warton, Hist. Eng. Poetry, ed. 1840, ii. 210, remarks&mdash;'Thomas
  duke of Gloucester, youngest son of Edw. III, and Henry earl of Derby,

  grand Masters and Knights of Prussia and Livonia, fought the infidels of
  Lithuania. Lord Derby was greatly instrumental in taking Vilna, the
  capital of that country, in the year 1390. Here is a seeming compliment
  to some of these expeditions.' Cf. Walsingham, Hist., ed. Riley, ii. 197.
  Hackluyt, in his Voyages, ed. 1598, i. 122, cites and translates the
  passage from Walsingham referred to above. However, the present passage

  life of Rd. Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick (born 1381, died 1439), I
  find&mdash;'Here shewes how erle Richard from Venise took his wey to

  coostes of Almayn toward Englond.'&mdash;Strutt, Manners and Customs.</p>

  <p>56-8. <i>Gernade</i>, Granada. 'The city of Algezir was taken from the
  Moorish King of <i>Granada</i> in 1344.'&mdash;T. The earls of Derby and
  Salisbury assisted at the siege; Weber, Met. Rom. iii. 306. It is the
  modern <i>Algeciras</i> on the S. coast of Spain, near Cape
  Trafalgar.</p>

  <p><i>Belmarye</i> and <i>Tramissene</i> (Tremezen), l. 62, were Moorish
  kingdoms in Africa, as appears from a passage in Froissart (bk. iv. c.
  24) cited by Tyrwhitt. Johnes' translation has&mdash;'Tunis, Bugia,
  Morocco, Benmarin, Tremeçen.' Cf. Kn. Tale, l. 1772 (A. 2630). Benmarin
  is called <i>Balmeryne</i> in Barbour's Bruce, xx. 393, and
  <i>Belmore</i> in the Sowdone of Babylon, 3122. The Gulf of Tremezen is
  on the coast of Algiers, to the west.</p>

  <p><i>Lyeys</i>, in Armenia, was taken from the Turks by Pierre de
  Lusignan <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>[8]</span>about 1367. It is the <i>Layas</i> mentioned
  by Froissart (see note to l. 51) and the modern <i>Ayas</i>; see the
  description of it in Marco Polo, ed. Yule, i. 15. Cf. 'Laiazzo's gulf,'
  Hoole's tr. of Ariosto's Orlando; bk. xix. l. 389.</p>

  <p><i>Satalye</i> (Attalia, now Adalia, on the S. coast of Asia Minor)
  was taken by the same prince soon after 1352.&mdash;T. See Acts xiv.
  25.</p>

  <p><i>Palatye</i> (Palathia, see l. 65), in Anatolia, was one of the
  lordships held by Christian knights after the Turkish conquest.&mdash;T.
  Cf. Froissart, bk. iii. c. 23.</p>

  <p>59. <i>the Grete See.</i> The Great Sea denotes the Mediterranean, as
  distinguished from the two so-called inland seas, the Sea of Tiberias and
  the Dead Sea. So in Numb. xxxiv. 6, 7; Josh. i. 4; also in Mandevile's
  Travels, c. 7.</p>

  <p>60. <i>aryve</i>, arrival or disembarkation of troops, as in the
  Harleian and Cambridge MSS. Many MSS. have <i>armee</i>, army, which
  gives no good sense, and probably arose from misreading the spelling
  <i>ariue</i> as <i>arme</i>. Perhaps the following use of <i>rive</i> for
  'shore' may serve to illustrate this passage:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>be</i> = <i>ben</i>, been. Cf. <i>ydo</i> = <i>ydon</i>, done,

  <p>62. <i>foghten</i> (f&#x1EB;uhten), pp. fought; from the strong verb
  <i>fighten</i>.</p>

  <p>63. 'He had fought thrice in the lists in defence of our faith'; i.&nbsp;e.
  when challenged by an infidel to do so. Such combats were not uncommon.
  <i>slayn</i>, slain, <i>hadde</i> must be supplied from l. 61.</p>

  <p>64. <i>ilke</i>, same; A. S. <i>ylca</i>.</p>

  <p>65. <i>Somtyme</i>, once on a time; not our 'sometimes.' See l.

  <p>66. <i>another hethen</i>, a heathen army different from that which he
  had encountered at Tremezen.</p>

  <p>67. <i>sovereyn prys</i> (suv·rein priis), exceeding great renown.</p>

  <p>69. 'As courteys as any mayde'; Arthur, ed. Furnivall (E. E. T. S.),
  l. 41. Cf. B. 1636.</p>

  <p>70. <i>vileinye</i>, any utterance unbecoming a gentleman. Cf. Trench,
  English Past and Present, ch. 7, on the word <i>villain</i>.</p>

  <p>71. <i>no maner wight</i>, no kind of person whatever. In M. E. the
  word <i>maner</i> is used without <i>of</i>, in phrases of this
  character.</p>

  <p>72. <i>verray</i>, very, true. <i>parfit</i>, perfect; F.
  <i>parfait</i>. <i>gentil</i>, gentle; see D. 1109-1176.</p>

  <p>74. 'His horses were good, but he himself was not gaudily dressed.'
  <i>Hors</i> is plural as well as singular. In fact, the knight had
  <i>three</i> horses; one for himself, one for his son, and one for the
  yeoman. Perhaps we should read&mdash;'but hé ne was not gay,' supplying
  <i>ne</i> from Hl. and Hn. This makes <i>he</i> emphatic; and we may then
  treat the <i>e</i> in <i>god-e</i> as a light extra syllable, at the
  caesural pause; for doing which there is ample authority. <!-- Page 9

  <p>75. <i>fustian</i>; see Babees Book, ed. Furnivall, p. 224.
  <i>gipoun</i> (jipuu·n), a diminutive of <i>gipe</i>, a tight-fitting
  vest, a doublet; also called a <i>gipell</i>, as in Libeaus Disconus,
  224. See Fairholt, s.&nbsp;v. <i>fustian</i>, and s.&nbsp;v. <i>gipon</i>. The
  O.&nbsp;F. <i>gipe</i> (whence F. <i>jupe</i>) meant a kind of frock or
  jacket. <i>wered</i> is the A.&nbsp;S. <i>werede</i>, pt. t. of the weak verb
  <i>werian</i>, to wear. It is now strong; pt. t. <i>wore</i>. See l.
  564.</p>

  <p>76. This verse is defective in the first foot, which consists solely
  of the word <i>Al</i>. Such verses are by no means uncommon in the Cant.
  Tales and in the Leg. of Good Women. Pron. (al· bismut·erd widh·iz
  ha·berjuu·n). 'His doublet of fustian was all soiled with marks made by
  the habergeon which he had so lately worn over it.' <i>Bismotered</i> has
  the same sense as mod. E. <i>besmutted</i>.</p>

  <p><i>habergeoun</i>, though etymologically a diminutive of
  <i>hauberk</i>, is often used as synonymous with it. 'It was a defence of
  an inferior description to the hauberk; but when the introduction of
  plate-armour, in the reign of Edward III, had supplied more convenient
  and effectual defences for the legs and thighs, the long skirt of the
  hauberk became superfluous; from that period the <i>habergeon</i> alone
  appears to have been worn.'&mdash;Way, note to Promptorium Parvulorum, p.

<p class="ac"><b>The Squyer.</b></p>

  <p>79. <i>squyer</i> = esquire, one who attended on a knight, and bore
  his lance and shield. See Strutt, Sports and Pastimes, Introd. § 8.
  'Esquires held land by the service of the shield, and were bound by their
  fee to attend the king, or their lords, in the war, or pay
  escuage.'&mdash;Strutt, Manners and Customs, iii. 15. And see Ritson,
  Met. Romances, iii. 345.</p>

  <p>As to the education and accomplishments of a squire, see note to Sir
  Topas, B. 1927.</p>

  <p>80. <i>lovyere</i>, lover. The <i>y</i> in this word is not euphonic
  as in some modern words; <i>lovyere</i> (luv·yer) is formed from the verb
  <i>lovi-en</i>, A.S. <i>lufian</i>, to love.</p>

  <p><i>bacheler</i>, a young aspirant to knighthood. There were bachelors
  in arms as well as in arts. Cf. The Sowdone of Babylone, 1211. <!-- Page
  10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[10]</span></p>

  <p>81. <i>lokkes</i>, locks (of hair). <i>crulle</i> (krull'), curly,
  curled; cf. Mid. Du. <i>krul</i>, a curl. In mod. E., the <i>r</i> has
  shifted its place. In King Alisaunder, ed. Weber, 4164, we
  find&mdash;'And his lokkes buth noght so crolle.' <i>as they</i>,
  &amp;c., as if they had been laid in an instrument for curling them by
  pressure. Curling-tongs seem to be meant; or, possibly, curling-papers.
  For <i>presse</i>, cf. l. 263.</p>

  <p>82. <i>yeer</i>. In the older stages of the language, <i>year</i>,
  <i>goat</i>, <i>swine</i>, &amp;c., being neuter nouns, underwent no
  change in the nom. case of the plural number. We have already had
  <i>hors</i>, pl., in l. 74.</p>

  <p><i>I gesse</i>, I should think. In M. E., <i>gesse</i> signifies to
  judge, believe, suppose, imagine. See Kn. Tale, l. 192 (A. 1050).</p>

  <p>83. <i>of evene lengthe</i>, of ordinary or moderate height.</p>

  <p>84. <i>deliver</i>, active. Cotgrave gives: '<i>delivre de sa
  personne</i>, an active, nimble wight.'</p>

  <p>85. <i>chivachye.</i> Fr. <i>chevauchée</i>. 'It most properly means
  an expedition with a small party of <i>cavalry</i>; but is often used
  generally for any military expedition.'&mdash;T. We should call it a
  'raid.' Cf. H. 50.</p>

  <p>87. <i>born him wel</i>, conducted himself well (behaved bravely),
  considering the short time he had served.</p>

  <p>88. <i>lady grace</i>, lady's grace. Here <i>lady</i> represents A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>hlæfdigan</i>, gen. case of <i>hlæfdige</i>, lady; there is therefore
  no final <i>s</i>. See l. 695, and G. 1348. Cf. the modern phrase
  'Lady-day,' as compared with 'Lord's day.'</p>

  <p>89. 'That was with floures swote enbrouded al'; Prol. to Legend of
  Good Women, l. 119; and cf. Rom. Rose, 896-8. <i>Embrouded</i>
  (embruu·ded <i>or</i> embr&#x1EB;u·ded), embroidered; from O.&nbsp;F.
  <i>brouder</i>, variant of <i>broder</i>, to embroider; confused with
  A.&nbsp;S. <i>brogden</i>, pp. of <i>bregdan</i>, to braid. <i>mede</i>, mead,
  meadow.</p>

  <p>91. <i>floytinge</i>, playing the flute. Cf. <i>floute</i> (ed. 1532,
  <i>floyte</i>), a flute; Ho. of Fame, 1223. Hexham gives Du.
  '<i>Fluyte</i>, a Flute.'</p>

  <p>96. 'Joust (in a tournament) and dance, and draw well and write.'</p>

  <p>97. <i>hote</i>, adv. hotly; from <i>hoot</i>, adj. hot.
  <i>nightertale</i>, night-time, time (or reckoning) of night. So also
  <i>wit nighter-tale</i>, lit. with night-time, Cursor Mundi, l. 2783;
  <i>on nightertale</i>, id. 2991; <i>be</i> [by] <i>nychtyrtale</i>,
  Barbour's Bruce, xix. 495. The word is used by Holinshed in his account
  of Joan of Arc (under the date 1429), but altered in the later edition to
  'the dead of the night'; it also occurs in Palladius on Husbandry, ed.
  Lodge, bk. i. l. 910; and in The Court of Love, l. 1355. Cf. Icel.
  <i>náttar-tal</i>, a tale, or number, of nights; and the phrase <i>á
  náttar-þeli</i>, at dead of night.</p>

  <p>98. <i>sleep</i>, also written <i>slep</i>, <i>slepte</i>. Cf.
  <i>weep</i>, <i>wepte</i>; <i>leep</i>, <i>lepte</i>, &amp;c.; such
  verbs, once strong, became weak. See l. 148; and Kn. Ta. 1829 (A.
  2687).</p>

  <p>100. <i>carf</i>, the past tense of <i>kerven</i>, to carve (pp.
  <i>corven</i>). The allusion is to what was then a common custom; cf. E.
  1773; Barbour's Bruce, i. 356. <i>biforn</i>, before; A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>biforan</i>. <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Yeman.</b></p>

  <p>101. <i>Yeman</i>, yeoman. 'As a title of service, it denoted a
  servant of the next degree above a <i>garson</i> or groom.... The title
  of <i>yeoman</i> was given in a secondary sense to people of middling
  rank not in service. The appropriation of the word to signify a small
  landholder is more modern.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. In ed. 1532, this paragraph
  is headed&mdash;'The Squyers yoman,' so that <i>he</i> (in this line)
  means the Squire, as we should naturally suppose from the context.
  Tyrwhitt, indeed, objects that 'Chaucer would never have given the son an
  attendant, when the father had none'; but he overlooks the fact that both
  the squire and the squire's man were necessarily servants to the knight,
  who, in this way, really had <i>two</i> servants; just as, in the note to
  l. 74, I have shewn that he had <i>three</i> horses. Warton, Strutt, and
  Todd all take this view of the matter, as might be expected. For further
  information as to the status of a <i>yeoman</i>, see Blackstone;
  Spelman's Glossary, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Socman</i>; Strutt, Manners and Customs,
  iii. 16; the Glossary to the Babees Book, ed. Furnivall; Waterhous,
  Comment. on Fortescue's De Laudibus Legum Angliæ, ed. 1663, p. 391;
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>na-mo</i>, no more (in number). In M. E., <i>mo</i> relates to
  number, but <i>more</i> to size; usually, but not always; see l. 808.</p>

  <p>102. <i>him liste</i>, it pleased him. <i>liste</i> is the past tense;
  <i>list</i>, it pleaseth, is the present. See note on l. 37.</p>

  <p>103. Archers were usually clad in 'Lincoln green'; cf. D. 1382.</p>

  <p>104. <i>a sheef of pecok-arwes</i>, a sheaf of arrows with peacocks'
  feathers. Ascham, in his Toxophilus, ed. Arber, p. 129, does not say much
  in favour of 'pecock fethers'; for 'there is no fether but onely of a
  goose that hath all commodities in it. And trewelye at a short but, which
  some man doth vse, the <i>pecock fether</i> doth seldome kepe vp the
  shaft eyther ryght or level, it is so roughe and heuy, so that many men
  which haue taken them vp for gaynesse, hathe layde them downe agayne for
  profyte; thus for our purpose, the goose is best fether for the best
  shoter.' In the Geste of Robyn Hode, pr. by W. Copland, we

  bought for the king, 12 <i>d.</i>... MS. Cotton, Nero c.
  viii.'&mdash;Strutt, Sports and Pastimes, bk. ii. ch. i. § 12. In the

  ... j. shaffe of pakok-fedird arrows: also I wyte them a dagger harnest

  Warton's note on this passage; Hist. E. Poet. 1840, ii. 211. <!-- Page 12
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>[12]</span></p>

  <p>106. <i>takel</i>, lit. 'implement' or 'implements'; here the set of
  arrows. For <i>takel</i> in the sense of 'arrow,' see Rom. Rose, 1729,
  1863. 'He knew well how to arrange his shooting-gear in a yeomanlike
  manner.' Strutt, Sports and Pastimes, bk. ii. c. 1. § 16, quotes a ballad
  in which Robin Hood proposes that each man who misses the mark shall lose
  'his <i>takell</i>'; and one of the losers says&mdash;'Syr abbot, I
  deliver thee myne <i>arrowe</i>.' Fairholt (s. v. <i>Tackle</i>) quotes
  from A Lytell Geste of Robyn Hood&mdash;</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the Cursor Mundi, l. 3600, Isaac sends Esau to hunt,
  saying:&mdash;'Ga lok thi <i>tacle</i> be puruaid.' Cotgrave
  gives&mdash;'<i>Tacle</i>, m. any (headed) shaft, or boult whose feathers
  be not waxed, but glued on.' Roquefort says the same.</p>

  <p>107. The sense is&mdash;'His arrows did not present a draggled
  appearance owing to the feathers being crushed'; i.&nbsp;e. the feathers stood
  out erect and regularly, as necessary to secure for them a good
  flight.</p>

  <p>109. <i>not-heed</i>, a head closely cut or cropped. Cf. 'To
  <i>Notte</i> his haire, <i>comas recidere</i>'; Baret's Alvearie, 1580.
  Shakespeare has <i>not-pated</i>, i.&nbsp;e. crop-headed, 1 Henry IV, ii. 4.
  78. Cooper's Thesaurus, 1565, has:&mdash;'<i>Tondere</i>, to cause his
  heare to be <i>notted</i> or polled of a barbour'; also, 'to <i>notte</i>
  his heare shorte'; also, '<i>Tonsus homo</i>, a man rounded, polled, or
  <i>notted</i>.' Cotgrave explains the F. <i>tonsure</i> as 'a sheering,
  clipping, powling, <i>notting</i>, cutting, or paring round.' Florio, ed.
  1598, explains Ital. <i>zucconare</i> as 'to poule, to <i>nott</i>, to
  shave, or cut off one's haire,' and <i>zuccone</i> as 'a shauen pate, a
  <i>notted</i> poule.' And more illustrations might be adduced, as e.g.
  the explanation of <i>Nott-pated</i> in Nares' Glossary. In later days
  the name of Roundhead came into use for a like reason. Cf. 'your
  <i>nott-headed</i> country gentleman'; Chapman, The Widow's Tears, Act i.
  sc. 4.</p>

  <p>110. 'He understood well all the usage of woodcraft.'</p>

  <p>111. <i>bracer</i>, a guard for the arm used by archers to prevent the
  friction of the bow-string on the coat. It was made like a glove with a
  long leathern top, covering the fore-arm (Fairholt). See it described in
  Ascham's Toxophilus, ed. Arber, pp. 107, 108. Cf. E. <i>brace</i>.</p>

  Sports and Pastimes, bk. iii. c. 6. § 22; Brand, Pop. Antiquities, ed.

  <p>114. <i>Harneised</i>, equipped. 'A certain girdle, <i>harnessed</i>
  with silver' is spoken of in Riley's Memorials of London, p. 399, with
  reference to the year 1376; cf. Riley's tr. of Liber Albus, p. 521. 'De j
  daggar harnisiat' x<i>d</i>.'; (1439) York Wills, iii. 96. 'De vj paribus

  harnest with sylver'; id. i. 419. And see note to l. 104.</p>

  <p>115. <i>Christofre.</i> 'A figure of St. Christopher, used as a
  brooch.... The figure of St. Christopher was looked upon with particular
  reverence <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>[13]</span>among the middle and lower classes; and was
  supposed to possess the power of shielding the person who looked on it
  from hidden dangers'; note in Wright's Chaucer. This belief is clearly
  shewn by a passage in Wright's History of Caricature. It is of so early
  an origin that we already meet with it in Anglo-Saxon in Cockayne's
  Shrine, p. 77, where we are told that St. Christopher 'prayed God that
  every one who has any relic of him should never be condemned in his sins,
  and that God's anger should never come upon him'; and that his prayer was
  granted. There is a well-known early woodcut exhibiting one of the
  earliest specimens of block-printing, engraved at p. 123 of Chambers'
  Book of Days, vol. ii, and frequently elsewhere. The inscription beneath
  the figure of the saint runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Hence the Yeoman wore his brooch for good luck. St. Christopher's day
  is July 25. For his legend, see Mrs. Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art,
  ii. 48; &amp;c. <i>shene</i>; see n. to l. 160.</p>

  <p>116. Riley, in his Memorials of London, p. 115, explains
  <i>baldric</i> as 'a belt passing mostly round one side of the neck, and
  under the opposite arm.' In 1314, a baldric cost 12<i>d.</i> (same
  reference). See Spenser, F. Q. i. 7. 29.</p>

  <p>117. <i>forster</i>, forester. Hence the names Forester, Forster, and
  Foster.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Prioresse.</b></p>

  <p>118. 'A nunne, y wene a pryores'; Rob. of Brunne, Hand. Synne,
  7809.</p>

  <p>120. In this line, as in ll. 509 and 697, the word <i>se-ynt</i> seems
  to be dissyllabic. Six MSS. agree here; and the seventh (Harleian) has
  <i>nas</i> for <i>was</i>, which keeps the same rhythm. Edd. 1532, 1550,
  and 1561 have the same words, omitting <i>but</i>.</p>

  <p><i>seynt Loy. Loy</i> is from <i>Eloy</i>, i.&nbsp;e. St. <i>Eligius</i>,
  whose day is Dec. 1; see the long account of him in Butler's Lives of the
  Saints. He was a goldsmith, and master of the mint to Clotaire II.,
  Dagobert I., and Clovis II. of France; and was also bishop of Noyon. He
  became the patron saint of goldsmiths, farriers, smiths, and carters. The
  Lat. <i>Eligius</i> necessarily became <i>Eloy</i> in O. French, and is
  <i>Eloy</i> or <i>Loy</i> in English, the latter form being the commoner.
  The Catholicon Anglicum (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1483) gives:
  '<i>Loye</i>, elegius (<i>sic</i>), nomen proprium.' Sir T. More, Works,
  ed. 1577, p. 194, says: '<i>St. Loy</i> we make an horse-leche.' Barnaby
  Googe, as cited in Brand, Pop. Antiq. i. 364 (ed. Ellis),

  <p>There is a district called <i>St. Loye's</i> in Bedford; a <i>Saint
  Loyes</i> chapel <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>[14]</span>near Exeter; &amp;c. Churchyard mentions
  'sweete <i>Saynct Loy</i>'; Siege of Leith, st. 50. In Lyndesay's
  Monarchè, bk. ii. lines 2299 and 2367, he is called 'sanct <i>Eloy</i>.'
  In D. 1564, the carter prays to God and Saint Loy, joining the names
  according to a common formula; but the Prioress dropped the divine name.
  Perhaps she invoked <i>St. Loy</i> as being the patron saint of
  goldsmiths; for she seems to have been a little given to a love of gold
  and corals; see ll. 158-162. Warton's notion, that <i>Loy</i> was a form
  of <i>Louis</i>, only shews how utterly unknown, in his time, were the
  phonetic laws of Old French.</p>

  <p>Many more illustrations might be added; such as&mdash;'<i>By St.
  Loy</i>, that draws deep'; Nash's Lenten Stuff, ed. Hindley, p. xiv. 'God
  save her and <i>Saint Loye</i>'; Jack Juggler, ed. Roxburgh Club, p. 9;
  and see <i>Eligius</i> in the Index to the Parker Society's
  publications.</p>

  <p>We already find, in Guillaume de Machault's Confort d'Ami, near the
  end, the expression:&mdash;'Car je te jur, par <i>saint Eloy</i>'; Works,
  ed. 1849, p. 120.</p>

  <p>The life of St. Eligius, as given in Alban Butler's Lives of the
  Saints, contains a curious passage, which seems worth citing:&mdash;'St.
  Owen relates many miracles which followed his death, and informs us that
  <i>the holy abbess</i>, St. Aurea, who was swept off by a pestilence, ...
  was advertised of her last hour some time before it, by a comfortable
  vision of <i>St. Eligius</i>.' See also Mrs. Jameson's Sacred and
  Legendary Art, 3rd ed., p. 728.</p>

  <p>There is, perhaps, a special propriety in selecting <i>St. Loy</i> for
  mention in the present instance. In an interesting letter in <i>The
  Athenæum</i> for Jan. 10, 1891, p. 54, Prof. Hales drew attention to the
  story about St. Eligius cited in Maitland's Dark Ages, pp. 83-4, ed.
  1853. When Dagobert asked Eligius to swear upon the relics of the saints,
  the bishop <i>refused</i>. On being further pressed to do so, he burst
  into tears; whereupon Dagobert exclaimed that he would believe him
  <i>without an oath</i>. Hence, to swear by St. Loy was to swear by one
  who refused to swear; and the oath became (at second-hand) no oath at
  all. See Hales, Folia Literaria, p. 102. At any rate, it was a very mild
  one for those times. Cf. Amis and Amiloun, 877:&mdash;'Than answered that
  maiden bright, And swore "by Jesu, ful of might."'</p>

  <p>126. <i>Frensh.</i> Mr. Cutts (Scenes and Characters of the Middle
  Ages, p. 58) says very justly:&mdash;'She spoke French correctly, though
  with an accent which savoured of the Benedictine convent at
  Stratford-le-Bow, where she had been educated, rather than of Paris.'
  There is nothing to shew that Chaucer here speaks slightingly of the
  French spoken by the Prioress, though this view is commonly adopted by
  newspaper-writers who know only this one line of Chaucer, and cannot
  forbear to use it in jest. Even Tyrwhitt and Wright have thoughtlessly
  given currency to this idea; and it is worth remarking that Tyrwhitt's
  conclusion as to Chaucer thinking but meanly of Anglo-French, was derived
  (as he tells us) from a remark in the Prologue to the Testament of Love,
  <i>which Chaucer did not write</i>! But Chaucer merely states a
  <i>fact</i>, viz. that the Prioress spoke the usual Anglo-French of the
  English court, of the English law-courts, and of the English
  ecclesiastics of the higher rank. The poet, however, had been himself in
  France, and knew precisely the difference between the two dialects; but
  he had no special reason for thinking <i>more highly</i> of the Parisian
  than of the Anglo-French. He merely states that the French which she
  spoke so 'fetisly' was, <i>naturally</i>, such as was spoken in England.
  She had never travelled, and was therefore quite satisfied with the
  French which she had learnt at home. The language of the King of England
  was quite as good, in the esteem of Chaucer's hearers, as that of the
  King of France; in fact, king Edward called himself king of France as
  well as of England, and king John was, at one time, merely his prisoner.
  Warton's note on the line is quite sane. He shews that queen Philippa
  wrote business letters in French (doubtless Anglo-French) with 'great
  propriety.' What Mr. Wright means by saying that 'it was similar to that
  used <i>at a later period</i> in the courts of law' is somewhat puzzling.
  It was, of course, not <i>similar to</i>, but the <i>very same</i>
  language as was used <i>at the very same period</i> in the courts of law.
  In fact, he and Tyrwhitt have unconsciously given us the view
  entertained, not by Chaucer, but by unthinking readers of the present
  age; a view which is <i>not</i> expressed, and was probably not intended.
  At the modern Stratford we may find Parisian French inefficiently taught;
  but at the ancient Stratford, the very important Anglo-French was taught
  efficiently enough. There is no parallel between the cases, nor any such
  jest as the modern journalist is never weary of, being encouraged by
  critics who ought to be more careful. The 'French of Norfolk' as spoken
  of in P. Plowman (B. v. 239) was no French at all, but <i>English</i>;
  and the alleged parallel is misleading, as the reader who cares to refer
  to that passage will easily see.</p>

  <p>'Stratford-at-Bow, a Benedictine nunnery, was famous even then for its
  antiquity.'&mdash;Todd, Illustrations of Chaucer, p. 233. It is said by
  Tanner to have been founded by William, bp. of London, before 1087; but
  Dugdale says it was founded by one Christiana de Sumery, and <!-- Page 16

  foundation was confirmed by King Stephen. It was dedicated to St.
  Leonard.</p>

  <p><i>unknowe</i>, short for <i>unknowen</i>, unknown.</p>

  <p>127. <i>At mete.</i> Tyrwhitt has acutely pointed out how Chaucer,
  throughout this passage, merely reproduces a passage in his favourite
  book, viz. Le Roman de la Rose, ed. Méon, l. 13612, &amp;c., which may be
  thus translated:&mdash;'and takes good care not to wet her fingers up to
  the joints in broth, nor to have her lips anointed with soups, or garlic,
  or fat flesh, nor to heap up too many or too large morsels and put them
  in her mouth. She touches with the tips of her fingers the morsel which
  she has to moisten with the sauce (be it green, or brown, or yellow), and
  lifts her mouthful warily, so that no drop of the soup, or relish or
  pepper may fall on her breast. And so daintily she contrives to drink, as
  not to sprinkle a drop upon herself ... she ought to wipe her lip so
  well, as not to permit any grease to stay there, at least upon her upper
  lip.' Such were the manners of the age. Cf. also Ovid, Ars Amatoria, iii.
  755, 756.</p>

  <p>134. <i>ferthing</i> signifies literally a fourth part, and hence a
  small portion, or a spot. In Caxton's Book of Curtesye, st. 27, such a
  spot of grease is called a 'fatte ferthyng.'</p>

  <p><i>sen-e</i>, visible, is an adjective, A. S. <i>ges&#x113;ne</i>, and
  takes a final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>. This distinguishes it
  from the pp. <i>seen</i>, which is monosyllabic, and cannot rime with
  <i>clen-e</i>. The fuller form <i>y-sen-e</i> occurs in l. 592, where it
  rimes with <i>len-e</i>.</p>

  <p>147. <i>wastel-breed</i>. Horses and dogs were not usually fed on
  <i>wastel-breed</i> or cake-bread (bread made of the best flour), but on
  coarse lentil bread baked for that purpose. See Our English Home, pp. 79,
  80. <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>148. The syllable <i>she</i> is here very light; <i>she if oon</i>
  constitutes the third foot in the line. After <i>she</i> comes the
  caesural pause. <i>weep</i>, wept; A. S. <i>w&#x113;op</i>.</p>

  <p>149. <i>men smoot</i>, one smote. If <i>men</i> were the ordinary
  plural of <i>man</i>, <i>smoot</i> ought to be <i>smiten</i> (pl. past);
  but <i>men</i> is here used like the Ger. <i>man</i>, French <i>on</i>,
  with the singular verb. It is, in fact, merely the <i>unaccented</i> form
  of <i>man</i>. <i>yerde</i>, stick, rod; mod. E. <i>yard</i>.
  <i>smerte</i>, sharply; adv.</p>

  <p>151. <i>wimpel.</i> The <i>wimple</i> or <i>gorger</i> is stated first

  <p>159. <i>bedes.</i> The word <i>bede</i> signifies, (1) a prayer; (2) a
  string of grains upon which the prayers were counted, or the grains
  themselves. The beads were made of coral, jet, cornelian, pearls, or

  the smaller beads, each for an Ave Maria. The common number was 55, for
  50 Aves and 5 Paternosters. The full number was 165, for 150 Aves and 15
  Paternosters, also called a Rosary or Our Lady's Psalter; see the poem on

  <i>Gaudez</i> in Cotgrave.</p>

  <p>160. <i>broche</i> = <i>brooch</i>, signified, (1) a pin; (2) a
  breast-pin; (3) a buckle or clasp; (4) a jewel or ornament. It was an
  ornament common to both sexes. The brooch seems to have been made in the
  shape of a capital A, surmounted by a crown. See the figure of a
  silver-gilt brooch in the shape of an A in the Glossary to Fairholt's
  Costume in England. The 'crowned A' is supposed to represent <i>Amor</i>
  or <i>Charity</i>, the greatest of all the Christian graces. 'Omnia

<p class="ac"><b>The Nonne and Three Preestes.</b></p>

  <p>163. <i>Another Nonne.</i> It was not common for Prioresses to have
  female chaplains; but Littré gives <i>chapelaine</i>, fem., as an old
  title of dignity in a nunnery. Moreover, it is an office still held in
  most Benedictine convents, as is fully explained in a letter written by a
  modern Nun-Chaplain, and printed in Anglia, iv. 238. See also N. and Q. 7
  S. vi. 485; The Academy, Aug. 23, 1890, p. 152.</p>

  <p>164. The mention of <i>three priests</i> presents some difficulty. To
  make up the twenty-nine mentioned in l. 24, we only want <i>one</i>
  priest, and it is afterwards assumed that there was but <i>one</i>
  priest, viz. the Nonnes Preest, who tells the tale of the Cock and Fox.
  Chaucer also, in all other cases, supposes that there was but <i>one</i>
  representative of each class.</p>

  <p>The most likely solution is that Chaucer wrote a character of the
  Second Nun, beginning&mdash;</p>

  gap, either by himself (temporarily), or indeed by some one else.</p>

  <p>If we are to keep the text (which stands alike in all MSS.), we must
  take '<i>wel</i> nyne and twenty' to mean '<i>at least</i> nine and
  twenty.'</p>

  <p>The letter from the Nun-Chaplain mentioned in the last note shews that
  an Abbess might have as many as <i>five</i> priests, as well as a
  chaplain. See Essays on Chaucer (Ch. Soc.), p. 183. The difficulty is,
  merely, how to reconcile this line with l. 24.</p>

  see his note in N. and Q. 7 S. vi. 425. The same vol. of Visitations also
  shews that, in the same abbey, another monk, 'Thomas Stonham tertius
  prior' was devoted to hunting; 'communis venator ... solet exire solus ad
  venatum mane in aurora.' There is also a complaint of the great number of
  dogs kept there&mdash;'superfluus numerus canum est in domo.' In the
  Rolls of Parliament (1406), vol. iii. p. 598, the sheriffs collect
  payments for the repair of roads and bridges 'par lour Ministres appellez
  Outryders'; N. and Q. 8 S. ii. 39. Note that this fully explains the use
  of <i>outryders</i> in P. Plowman, C. v. 116.</p>

  <p><i>venerye</i>, hunting; cf. A. 2308. 'The monks of the middle ages
  were extremely attached to hunting and field-sports; and this was a
  frequent subject of complaint with the more austere ecclesiastics, and of
  satire with the laity.'&mdash;Wright. See Strutt's Sports and Pastimes,
  bk. i. c. 1. §§ 9, 10; Our Eng. Home, p. 23. From Lat. <i>uenari</i>, to
  hunt.</p>

  <p>168. <i>deyntee</i>, dainty, i.&nbsp;e. precious, valuable, rare; orig. a
  sb., viz. O. F. <i>deintee</i>, dignity, from Lat. acc.
  <i>dignitatem</i>. Cf. l. 346.</p>

  <p>170. <i>Ginglen</i>, jingle. (The line is deficient in the first
  foot.) Fashionable riders were in the habit of hanging small bells on the
  bridles and harness of their horses. Wyclif speaks of 'a worldly preest
  ... in pompe and pride, coveitise and envye ... with fatte hors, and
  jolye and gaye sadeles, and bridelis <i>ryngynge be the weye</i>, and
  himself in costy clothes and pelure' [fur]; Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 519,
  520.</p>

  <p>'Vincent of Beauvais, speaking of the Knights Templars, and their
  gorgeous horse-caparisons, says they have&mdash;in pectoralibus
  campanulas infixas magnum emittentes sonitum'; Hist. lib. xxx. c. 85
  (cited by Warton, Hist. E. P. i. 167). See B. 3984; and Spenser, F.&nbsp;Q. i.
  2. 13; also Englische Studien, iii. 105.</p>

  <p>172. <i>Ther as</i> = where that. <i>keper</i>, principal, head, i.&nbsp;e.
  prior. <i>celle</i>, cell; a 'cell' was a small monastery or nunnery,
  dependent on a larger one. '<i>Celle</i>, a religious house, subordinate
  to some great <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>[21]</span>abby. Of these <i>cells</i> some were
  altogether subject to their respective abbies, who appointed their
  officers, and received their revenues; while others consisted of a stated
  number of monks, who had a prior sent them from the abby, and who paid an
  annual pension as an acknowledgment of their subjection; but, in other
  matters, acted as an independent body, and received the rest of their
  revenues for their own use. These <i>priories</i> or <i>cells</i> were of
  the same order with the abbies on whom they depended. See Tanner, Pref.
  Not. Monast. p. xxvii.'&mdash;Todd, Illustrations of Chaucer, p.326. Cf.
  note to l. 670, and especially the note to D. 2259.</p>

  <p>173. <i>The reule</i> (rule) <i>of seint Maure</i> (St. Maur) and that
  of <i>seint Beneit</i> (St. Benet or Benedict) were the oldest forms of
  monastic discipline in the Romish Church. St. Maur (Jan. 15) was a
  disciple of St. Benet (Dec. 4), who founded the Benedictine order, and
  died about <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 542.</p>

  <p>174. Note that <i>streit</i>, mod. E. <i>strait</i>, A. F.
  <i>estreit</i>, from Lat. <i>strictus</i>, is quite distinct from mod. E.
  <i>straight</i>, of A.&nbsp;S. origin.</p>

  <p>175. The Harl. MS. reads, 'This ilke monk leet forby hem pace'
  (<i>error for</i> leet hem forby him pace?), 'This same monk let them
  pass by him unobserved.' <i>hem</i> refers to the rules of St. Maur and
  St. Benet, which were too <i>streit</i> (strict) for this 'lord' or
  superior of the house, who preferred a milder sort of discipline.
  <i>Forby</i> is still used in Scotland for <i>by</i> or <i>past</i>.
  <i>pace</i>, pass by, remain in abeyance; cf. <i>pace</i>, pass on,
  proceed, in l. 36. <i>hem</i>, them; originally dat. pl. of
  <i>he</i>.</p>

  <p>176. <i>space</i>, course (Lat. <i>spatium</i>); 'and held his course
  in conformity with the new order of things.'</p>

  <p>177. <i>yaf not of</i>, gave not for, valued not. <i>yaf</i> is the
  pt. t. of <i>yeven</i> or <i>yiven</i>, to give.</p>

  <p><i>a pulled hen</i>, lit. a plucked hen; hence, the value of a hen
  without its feathers; see l. 652. In D. 1112, the phrase is 'not worth a
  <i>hen</i>.' Tyrwhitt says, 'I do not see much force in the epithet
  <i>pulled</i>'; but adds, in his Glossary&mdash;'I have been told since,
  that a hen whose feathers are pulled, or plucked off, will not lay any
  eggs.' Becon speaks of a 'polled hen,' i.&nbsp;e. pulled hen, as one unable to
  fly; Works, p. 533; Parker Soc. It is only one of the numerous old
  phrases for expressing that a thing is of small value. See l. 182. I may
  add that <i>pulled</i>, in the sense of 'plucked off the feathers,'
  occurs in the Manciple's Tale; H. 304. And see Troil. v. 1546.</p>

  <p><i>text</i>, remark in writing; the word was used of any written
  statement that was frequently quoted. The allusion is to the legend of
  Nimrod, 'the mighty hunter' (Gen. x. 9), which described him as a very
  bad man. 'Mikel he cuth [much he knew] o sin and scham'; Cursor Mundi, l.
  2202. It was he (it was said) who built the tower of Babel, and
  introduced idolatry and fire-worship. All this has ceased to be familiar,
  and the allusion has lost its point. 'We enjoin that a priest be not a
  hunter, nor a hawker, nor a dicer'; Canons of King Edgar, translated; no.
  64. See my note to P. Plowman, C. vi. 157. <!-- Page 22 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>[22]</span></p>

  <p>179. <i>recchelees</i> (in MS. E.) means careless, regardless of rule;
  but 'a careless monk' is not necessarily 'a monk out of his cloister.'
  But the reading <i>cloisterless</i> (in MS. Harl.) solves the difficulty;
  being <i>a coined word</i>, Chaucer goes on to explain it in l. 181. See
  the quotation from Jehan de Meung in the next note.</p>

  <p>179-81. This passage, says Tyrwhitt, 'is attributed by Gratian
  (<i>Decretal.</i> P. ii. Cau. xvi. q. l. c. viii.) to a pope Eugenius:
  <i>Sicut piscis sine aqua caret vita, ita sine monasterio monachus.</i>'
  Joinville says, 'The Scriptures do say that a monk cannot live out of his
  cloister without falling into deadly sins, any more than a fish can live
  out of water without dying.' Cf. Piers Plowman, B. x. 292; and my
  note.</p>

  <p>Wyclif (Works, ed. Matthew), p. 449, has a similar remark:&mdash;'For,
  as they seyn that groundiden [<i>founded</i>] these cloystris, thes men
  myghten no more dwelle out ther-of than fizs myghte dwelle out of water,
  for vertu that they han ther-ynne.' The simile is very old; in The
  Academy, Nov. 29, 1890, Prof. Albert Cook traced it back to Sozomen,
  Eccl. Hist. bk. i. c. 13 (Migne, Patr. Graec. 67. 898):&mdash;<span

  <p>Moreover, the poet was thinking of a passage in Le Testament de Jehan
  de Meung, ed. Méon, l. 1166:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Qui les voldra trover, si les quiere en leur cloistre ...</p>
      <p>Car ne prisent le munde la montance d'une oistre.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. 'whoever would find them, let him seek them in their cloister;
  for they do not prize the world at the value of an oyster.' Chaucer turns
  this passage just the other way about.</p>

  <p>182. <i>text</i>, remark, saying (as above, in l. 177). <i>held</i>,
  esteemed.</p>

  <p>183. 'And <i>I</i> said.' This is a very realistic touch; as if
  Chaucer had been talking to the monk, obtaining his opinions, and
  professing to agree with them.</p>

  <p>184. <i>What</i> has here its earliest sense of <i>wherefore</i>, or
  <i>why</i>.</p>

  <p><i>wood</i>, mad, foolish, is frequently employed by Spenser; A. S.
  <i>w&#x14D;d</i>.</p>

  <p>186. <i>swinken</i>, to toil; whence '<i>swinked</i> hedger,' used by
  Milton (Comus, l. 293). But <i>swinken</i> is, properly, a strong verb;
  A.&nbsp;S. <i>swincan</i>, pt. t. <i>swanc</i>, pp. <i>swuncen</i>. Hence
  <i>swink</i>, s., toil; l. 188.</p>

  <p>187. <i>bit</i>, the 3rd pers. sing. pres. of <i>bidden</i>, to
  command. So also <i>rit</i>, rideth, A. 974, 981; <i>fynt</i>, findeth,
  A. 4071; <i>rist</i>, riseth, A. 4193; <i>stant</i>, standeth, B. 618;
  <i>sit</i>, sitteth, D. 1657; <i>smit</i>, smiteth, E. 122; <i>hit</i>,
  hideth, F. 512.</p>

  <p>187, 188. <i>Austin</i>, St. Augustine. The reference is to St.
  Augustine <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>[23]</span>of Hippo, after whom the Augustinian Canons
  were named. Their rule was compiled from his writings. Thus we read that
  'bothe monks and chanouns forsaken the reules of Benet and Austyn';
  Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 511. And again&mdash;'Seynt Austyn
  techith munkis <i>to labore with here hondis</i>, and so doth seint Benet
  and seynt Bernard'; Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, p. 51. See Cutts, Scenes
  and Characters, &amp;c.; ch. ii. and ch. iii.</p>

  <p>189. <i>a pricasour</i>, a hard rider. <i>priking</i>, hard riding (l.
  191).</p>

  <p>190. Cf. 'Also fast so the fowl in flyght'; Ywaine and Gawin, 630.</p>

  <p>192. <i>for no cost</i>, for no expense. Dr. Morris explains <i>for no
  cost</i> by 'for no reason,' and certainly M.&nbsp;E. <i>cost</i> sometimes
  has such a force; but see ll. 213, 799, where it clearly means
  'expense.'</p>

  <p>193. <i>seigh</i>, saw; A. S. <i>s&#x113;ah</i>, pt. t. of
  <i>s&#x113;on</i>, to see.</p>

  <p><i>purfiled</i>, edged with fur. The M. E. <i>purfil</i> signifies the
  embroidered or furred hem of a garment, so that <i>purfile</i> is to work
  upon the edge. <i>Purfiled</i> has also a more extended meaning, and is
  applied to garments overlaid with gems or other ornaments. '<i>Pourfiler
  d'or</i>, to <i>purfle</i>, tinsell, or overcast with gold thread,'
  &amp;c.: Cotgrave. Spenser uses <i>purfled</i> in the Fairy Queene, i. 2.
  13; ii. 3. 26. Cf. note to P. Plowman, C. iii. 10.</p>

  <p>194. <i>grys</i>, a sort of costly grey fur, formerly very much
  esteemed; O. F. <i>gris</i>, Rom. de la Rose, 9121, 9307; Sir Tristrem,
  l. 1381. 'The <i>grey</i> is the back-fur of the northern squirrel'; L.
  Gautier, Chivalry (Eng. tr.), p. 323. Such a dress as is here described
  must have been very expensive. In 1231 (Close Roll, 16 Hen. III.), king
  Henry III. had a skirt (<i>iupa</i>) of scarlet, furred with red
  <i>gris</i>. See Gloss. to Liber Custumarum, ed. Riley, s.&nbsp;v.

  <p>The Council of London (1342) reproaches the religious orders with
  wearing clothing 'fit rather for knights than for clerks, that is to say,
  short, very tight, with excessively wide sleeves, not reaching the
  elbows, but hanging down very low, lined with fur or with silk'; see J.
  Jusserand, English Wayfaring Life (1889). Cf. Wyclif, Works, ed. Matthew,

  <p>196. 'He had an elaborate brooch, made of gold, with a love-knot in
  the larger end.' <i>love-knotte</i>, a complicated twist, with loops.</p>

  <p>198. <i>balled</i>, bald. See Specimens of Early English, ii. 15.
  408.</p>

  <p>199. <i>anoint</i>, anointed; O. F. <i>enoint</i>, Lat.
  <i>inunctus</i>.</p>

  <p>200. <i>in good point</i>, in good case, imitated from the O. F. <i>en
  bon point</i>. Cotgrave has: '<i>En bon poinct</i>, ou, <i>bien en
  poinct</i>, handsome: faire, fat, well liking, in good taking.' <!-- Page
  24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[24]</span></p>

  <p>201. <i>stepe</i>, E. E. <i>steap</i>, does not here mean
  <i>sunken</i>, but <i>bright</i>, burning, fiery. Mr. Cockayne has
  illustrated the use of this word in his Seinte Marherete, pp. 9, 108:
  'His twa ehnen [semden] <i>steappre</i> þene steorren,' his two eyes
  seemed <i>brighter</i> than stars. So also: 'schininde and schenre, of
  &#x21D;imstanes <i>steapre</i> then is eni steorre,' shining and clearer,
  brighter with gems than is any star; St. Katherine, l. 1647. The
  expression 'eyen gray and <i>stepe</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. bright, has already been
  quoted in the note to l. 152. So also 'Eyyen <i>stepe</i> and graye';
  King of Tars, l. 15 (in Ritson, Met. Rom. ii. 157); and again, 'thair een
  <i>steep</i>'; Palladius on Husbandry, bk. iv. l. 800. Cf. <i>stemed</i>
  in the next line; and see l. 753.</p>

  <p>202. <i>stemed as a forneys of a leed</i>, shone like the fire under a
  cauldron. Here <i>stemed</i> is related to the M.&nbsp;E. <i>st&#x113;m</i>, a
  bright light, used in Havelok, 591. Cf. 'two <i>stemyng</i> eyes,' two
  bright eyes; Sir T. Wiat, Sat. i. 53. <i>That</i> refers to <i>eyen</i>,
  not to <i>heed</i>.</p>

  <p>A kitchen-copper is still sometimes called a <i>lead</i>. As to the
  word <i>leed</i>, which is the same as the modern E. <i>lead</i> (the
  metal), Mr. Stevenson, in his edition of the Nottingham Records, iii.
  493, observes&mdash;'That these vessels were really made of <i>lead</i>
  we have ample evidence'; and refers us to the Laws of Æthelstán, iv. 7
  (Schmid, Anhang, xvi. § 1); &amp;c. He adds&mdash;'The <i>lead</i> was
  frequently fixed, like a modern domestic copper, over a grate. The grate
  and flue were known as a <i>furnace</i>. Hence the frequent
  expression&mdash;<i>a lead in furnace</i>.' See also <i>led</i> in
  Havelok, l. 924; and <i>lead</i> in Tusser's Husbandrie, E. D. S.</p>

  <p>203. <i>botes souple</i>, boots pliable, soft, and close-fitting.</p>

  <p>'This is part of the description of a smart abbot, by an anonymous
  writer of the thirteenth century: "Ocreas habebat in cruribus quasi
  innatae essent, sine plica porrectas."&mdash;MS. Bodley, James, no. 6. p.
  121.'&mdash;T. See Rom. of the Rose, 2265-70 (vol. i. p. 173).</p>

  <p>205. <i>for-pyned</i>, 'tormented,' and hence 'wasted away'; from
  <i>pine</i>. The <i>for-</i> is intensive, as in Eng.
  <i>forswear</i>.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Frere.</b></p>

  <p>208. <i>Frere</i>, friar. The four orders of mendicant friars
  mentioned in l. 210 were:&mdash;(1) The Dominicans, or friars-preachers,
  who took up their abode in Oxford in 1221, known as the Black Friars. (2)
  The Franciscans, founded by St. Francis of Assisi in 1209, and known by
  the name of Grey Friars. They made their first appearance in England in
  1224. (3) The Carmelites, or White Friars. (4) The Augustin (or Austin)
  Friars. The friar was popular with the mercantile classes on account of
  his varied attainments and experience. 'Who else so welcome at the houses
  of men to whom scientific skill and information, scanty as they might be,
  were yet of no inconsiderable service and attraction. He alone of learned
  and unlearned possessed some knowledge of foreign countries and their
  productions; he alone was acquainted with the composition and
  decomposition of bodies, with the art of distillation, <!-- Page 25
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[25]</span>with the
  construction of machinery, and with the use of the laboratory.' See
  Professor Brewer's Preface to Monumenta Franciscana, p. xlv; and, in
  particular, the poem called 'Pierce the Ploughman's Crede,' and the
  satirical piece against the Friars entitled Jack Upland, formerly printed
  with Chaucer's Works. Several pieces against them will also be found in
  Political Poems, ed. Wright (Record Series); and there are numerous
  outspoken attacks upon them in Wyclif's various works, as, e.g. in the
  Select Eng. Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 366, and in his Works, ed. Matthew,
  p. 47. See also the chapter on Friars in the E. translation of Jusserand,
  Eng. Wayfaring Life; p. 293.</p>

  <p>Many of the remarks concerning the Frere are ultimately due to Le
  Roman de la Rose. See The Romaunt of the Rose, ll. 6161-7698; in vol. i.
  pp. 234-259.</p>

  <p><i>wantown</i>, sometimes written <i>wantowen</i>, literally signifies
  untrained, and hence wild, brisk, lively. <i>wan-</i> is a common M.&nbsp;E.
  prefix, equivalent to our <i>un-</i> or <i>dis-</i>, as in
  <i>wanhope</i>, despair; <i>towen</i> or <i>town</i> occurs in M.&nbsp;E.
  writers for well-behaved, well-taught; from A.&nbsp;S. <i>togen</i>, pp. of
  <i>t&#x113;on</i>, to educate.</p>

  <p><i>merye</i>, pleasant; cf. M. E. <i>mery wether</i>, pleasant
  weather.</p>

  <p>209. <i>limitour</i> was a begging friar to whom was assigned a
  certain district or <i>limit</i>, within which he was permitted to
  solicit alms; it was also his business to solicit persons to purchase a
  partnership, or <i>brotherhood</i>, in the merits of their conventual
  services. See Tyndale's Works, i. 212 (Parker Soc.); and note to P.
  Plowman, B. v. 138. Hence in later times the verb <i>limit</i> signifies
  to beg.</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>210. <i>ordres foure</i>, four orders (note to l. 208). <i>can</i>,
  i.&nbsp;e. 'knows.'</p>

  <p>211. <i>daliaunce and fair langage</i>, gossip and flattery.
  <i>daliaunce</i> in M. E. signifies 'tittle-tattle' or 'gossip.' The verb
  <i>dally</i> signifies not only to loiter or idle, but to play, sport.
  Godefroy gives O.&nbsp;F. '<i>dallier</i>, v. a., railler.'</p>

  <p>212. 'He had, at his own expense, well married many young women.' This
  is less generous than might appear; for it almost certainly refers to
  young women who had been his concubines. As Dr. Furnivall remarks in his
  Temporary Preface, p. 118&mdash;'the true explanation lies in the
  following extract from a letter of Dr. Layton to Cromwell, in 1535 <span
  class="sm">A. D.</span>, in Mr. Thos. Wright's edition of Letters on the
  Suppression of the Monasteries (Camden Soc.), p. 58: [At Maiden Bradley,
  near Bristol] "is an holy father prior, and hath but vj. children, and
  but one dowghter mariede yet of the goodes of the monasterie, trystyng
  shortly to mary the reste. His sones be tall men, waittyng upon him; and

  class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>[26]</span>but all with madens, the
  faireste cowlde be gottyn, and <i>always marede them ryght
  well</i>."'</p>

  <p>214. <i>post</i>, pillar or support, as in Troil. i. 1000. See Gal.
  ii. 9.</p>

  <p>216. <i>frankeleyns</i>, wealthy farmers; see l. 331. <i>over-al</i>,
  everywhere.</p>

  <p>217. <i>worthy</i>, probably 'wealthy'; or else, 'respectable.' Cf. l.
  68.</p>

  <p>219. The word <i>mór-e </i>occupies the fourth foot in the line; cf.
  n. to l. 320. It is an adj., with the sense of 'greater.'</p>

  <p>220. <i>licentiat.</i> He had a licence from the Pope 'to hear
  confessions, &amp;c., in all places, independently of the local
  ordinaries.'&mdash;T. The <i>curate</i>, or parish priest, could not
  grant absolution in all cases, some of which were reserved for the
  bishop's decision. See Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 394.</p>

  <p>224. <i>wiste to han</i>, knew (he was sure) to have.</p>

  <p><i>pitaunce</i> here signifies a mess of victuals. It originally
  signified an extraordinary allowance of victuals given to monastics, in
  addition to their usual commons, and was afterwards applied to the whole
  allowance of food for a single person, or to a small portion of
  anything.</p>

  <p>225. 'For the giving (of gifts) to a poor order.' <i>povre</i>, O.&nbsp;F.
  <i>povre</i>, poor; cf. <i>pover-ty</i>. See <i>pov-re</i> in l. 232.</p>

  <p>226. <i>y-shrive</i> = <i>y-shriven</i>, confessed, <i>shriven</i>.
  The final <i>n</i> is dropped; cf. <i>unknowe</i> for <i>unknowen</i> in
  l. 126.</p>

  <p>227. <i>he dorste</i>, he durst make (it his) boast, i.&nbsp;e. confidently
  assert.</p>

  <p><i>avaunt</i>, a boast, is from the O. F. vb. <i>avanter</i>, to
  boast, an intensive form of <i>vanter</i>, whence E. <i>vaunt</i>.</p>

  <p>230. <i>he may not</i>, he is not able to. <i>him sore smerte</i>, it
  may pain him, or grieve him, sorely.</p>

  <p>232. <i>Men moot</i>, one ought to. Here <i>moot</i> is singular; cf.
  l. 149.</p>

  <p>233. <i>tipet</i>, a loose hood, which seems to have been used as a
  pocket. 'When the Order [of Franciscans] degenerated, the friar combined
  with the spiritual functions the occupation of pedlar, huxter,
  mountebank, and quack doctor.' (Brewer.) 'Thei [the friars] becomen
  pedderis [pedlars], berynge knyues, pursis, pynnys, and girdlis, and
  spices, and sylk, and precious pellure and forrouris [<i>sorts of
  fur</i>] for wymmen, and therto smale gentil hondis [<i>dogs</i>], to
  gete love of hem, and to haue many grete yiftis for litil good or
  nought.'&mdash;Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, p. 12. As to the
  <i>tipet</i>, cf. notes to ll. 682, 3953.</p>

  <p>In an old poem printed in Brewer's Monumenta Franciscana, we have the
  following allusion to the dealings of the friar:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'For thai have noght to lyve by, they wandren here and there,</p>
      <p>And dele with dyvers marche, right as thai pedlers were;</p>
      <p>Thei dele with pynnes and knyves,</p>
      <p>With gyrdles, gloves for wenches and wyves,</p>
      <p>Ther thai are haunted till.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a poem in MS. Camb., Ff. 1. 6, fol. 156, it is explained that the
  limitour craftily gives 'pynnys, gerdyllis, and knyeffis' to wommen, in
  order to receive better things in return. He could get knives for <!--
  Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>[27]</span>less
  than a penny a-piece. Cf. 'De j. doss. cultellorum dict. penyware.
  x<i>d.</i>'; York Wills, iii. 96.</p>

  <p>Women used to wear knives sheathed and suspended from their girdles;
  such knives were often given to a bride. See the chapter on
  <i>Bride-knives</i> in Brand's Popular Antiquities.</p>

  <p><i>farsed</i>, stuffed; from F. <i>farcir</i>. Cf. E.
  <i>farce</i>.</p>

  <p>236. <i>rote</i> is a kind of fiddle or 'crowd,' not a hurdy-gurdy, as
  it is explained by Ritson, and in the glossary to Sir Tristrem. Cf.
  Spenser, F. Q. ii. 10. 3; iv. 9. 6; Sir Degrevant, l. 37 (see Halliwell's
  note, at p. 289 of the Thornton Romances). See my Etym. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>237. <i>yeddinges</i>, songs embodying some popular tales or romances.
  In Sir Degrevant, l. 1421, we are told that a lady 'song yeddyngus,'
  i.&nbsp;e. sang songs. For singing such songs, he was in the highest
  estimation. From A.&nbsp;S. <i>geddian</i>, to sing. Cf. P. Plowman, A. i.
  138:&mdash;'Ther thou art murie at thy mete, whon me biddeth the
  <i>yedde</i>.'</p>

  <p><i>prys</i> answers both to E. <i>prize</i> and <i>price</i>; cf. l.
  67.</p>

  <p>239. <i>champioun</i>, champion; i.&nbsp;e. a professional fighter in
  judicial lists. Cf. P. Plowman, C. xxi. 104; and see Britton, liv. i. ch.
  23. § 15.</p>

  <p>241. <i>tappestere</i>, a female tapster. In olden times the retailers
  of beer, and for the most part the brewers also, appear to have been
  females. The <i><span class="nw">-stere</span></i> or <i><span
  class="nw">-ster</span></i> as a feminine affix (though in the fourteenth
  century it is not always or regularly used as such) occurs in M. E.
  <i>brewstere</i>, <i>webbestere</i>, Eng. <i>spinster</i>. In
  <i>huckster</i>, <i>maltster</i>, <i>songster</i>, this affix has
  acquired the meaning of an agent; and in <i>youngster</i>,
  <i>gamester</i>, <i>punster</i>, &amp;c., it implies contempt. See Skeat,
  Principles of Etymology, pt. i. § 238. Cf. <i>beggestere</i>, female
  beggar, 242.</p>

  <p>242. <i>Bet</i>, better, adv.; as distinguished from <i>bettre</i>,
  adj. (l. 524).</p>

  <p><i>lazar</i>, a leper; from <i>Lazarus</i>, in the parable of Dives
  and Lazarus; hence <i>lazaretto</i>, a hospital for lepers, a
  lazar-house.</p>

  <p>244. 'It was unsuitable, considering his ability.'</p>

  <p>246. 'It is not becoming, it may not advance (profit) to deal with
  (associate with) any such poor people.' Cf. Rom. of the Rose, 6455, 6462;
  and note to P. Plowman, C. xiii. 21.</p>

  <p>247. The line is imperfect in the first foot.</p>

  <p><i>poraille</i>, rabble of poor people; from O. F. <i>povre</i>,
  poor.</p>

  <p>248. <i>riche</i>, i.&nbsp;e. rich people.</p>

  <p>249, 250. 'And everywhere, wherever profit was likely to accrue,
  courteous he was, and humble in offering his services.'</p>

  <p>251. <i>vertuous</i>, (probably) energetic, efficient; cf.
  <i>vertu</i> in l. 4.</p>

  <p>252, 253. Between these two lines the Hengwrt MS. inserts the two
  lines marked 252 <i>b</i> and 252 <i>c</i>, which are omitted in the
  other MSS., though they certainly appear to be genuine, and are found in
  all the black-letter editions, which follow Thynne. In the Six-text
  edition, which is here followed, they are not counted in. Tyrwhitt both
  inserts and numbers them; hence a slight difference in the methods of
  numbering the lines after this line. Tyrwhitt's numbering is given, <!--
  Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[28]</span>at every
  tenth line, within marks of parenthesis, for convenience of reference.
  The sense is&mdash;'And gave a certain annual payment for the grant (to
  be licensed to beg; in consequence of which) none of his brethren came
  with his limit.'</p>

  <p><i>ferme</i> is the mod. E. <i>farm</i>; cf. 'to <i>farm</i>
  revenues.'</p>

  <p>253. <i>sho</i>, shoe; not <i>sou</i> (as has been suggested), which
  would (in fact) give <i>a false rime</i>. So also 'worth his olde
  <i>sho</i>'; D. 708.</p>

  <p>The friars were not above receiving even the smallest articles; and
  <i>ferthing</i>, in l. 255, may be explained by 'small article,' of a
  farthing's value. See l. 134.</p>

  iii. 61, Parker Soc.):&mdash;'Such is the limiter's saying of <i>In

  <p>258. <i>love-dayes.</i> 'Love-days (<i>dies amoris</i>) were days
  fixed for settling differences by umpire, without having recourse to law
  or violence. The ecclesiastics seem generally to have had the principal
  share in the management of these transactions, which, throughout the
  Vision of Piers Ploughman, appear to be censured as the means of
  hindering justice and of enriching the clergy.'&mdash;Wright's Vision of

  <i>For</i> in Chaucer also means 'against,' or 'to prevent,' but not (I

  <p>277. <i>Middelburgh and Orewelle.</i> '<i>Middelburgh</i> is still a
  well-known port of the island of Walcheren, in the Netherlands, almost

  rivers Stoure and <i>Orwell</i>. This spot was formerly known as the port
  of <i>Orwell</i> or <i>Orewelle</i>.'&mdash;Saunders, p. 229.</p>

  <p>This mention of Middelburgh 'proves that the Prologue must have been

<p class="ac"><b>The Clerk.</b></p>

  <p>285. <i>Clerk</i>, a university student, a scholar preparing for the

  name="page31"></a>[31]</span>Anstey's Munimenta Academica for much
  interesting information on early Oxford life and studies.</p>

  <i>Oxnaford</i>); and it has not been proved that this etymology is
  wrong.</p>

  <p><i>y-go</i>, gone, betaken himself.</p>

  <p>287. Hence 'Leane as a rake' in Skelton, Philip Sparowe, l. 913; 'A
  villaine, leane as any rake, appeares'; W. Browne, Brit. Past. bk. ii.
  song 1.</p>

  <p>290. 'His uppermost short cloak (of coarse cloth).' The syllable

  <p>296. In the Milleres Tale, Chaucer describes a clerk of a very
  opposite character, who loved dissipation and played upon a 'sautrye' or
  psaltery. See A. 3200-20.</p>

  <p><i>fithel</i> is the mod. E. <i>fiddle</i>. <i>sautrye</i> is an O. F.
  spelling of our <i>psaltery</i>.</p>

  <p>297. <i>philosophre</i> is used in a double sense; it sometimes meant
  an alchemist, as in G. 1427. The clerk knew philosophy, but he was no
  alchemist, and so had but little gold.</p>

  <p>298. <i>Hadde</i>, possessed; as <i>hadde</i> is here emphatic, the
  final <i>e</i> is not elided. So also in l. 386.</p>

  <p>301. Chaucer often imitates his own lines. He here imitates Troil. iv.
  1174&mdash;'And pitously gan for the soule preye.' <i>gan</i>, did.</p>

  <p>302. <i>yaf him</i>, 'gave him (money) wherewith to attend school.' An
  allusion to the common practice, at this period, of poor scholars in the
  Universities, who wandered about the country begging, to raise money to
  support them in their studies. Luther underwent a similar experience. Cf.

  London, ed. Riley, p. 48.</p>

  <p>329. <i>ceint of silk</i>, &amp;c., a girdle of silk, with small
  ornaments. The <i>barres</i> were called <i>cloux</i> in French (Lat.
  <i>clavus</i>), and were the usual ornaments of a girdle. They were
  perforated to allow the tongue of the buckle to pass through them.
  'Originally they were attached transversely to the wide tissue of which
  the girdle was formed, but subsequently were round or square, or
  fashioned like the heads of lions, and similar devices, the name of
  <i>barre</i> being still retained, though improperly.'&mdash;Way, in

  <p>333. 'He was sanguine of complexion.' The old school of medicine,
  following Galen, supposed that there were four 'humours,' viz. hot, cold,
  moist, and dry (see l. 420), and four complexions or temperaments of men,
  viz. the sanguine, the choleric, the phlegmatic, and the melancholy. The

  French word <i>enviné</i> in the same sense.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt.</p>

  <p>343. <i>bake mete</i> = <i>baked meat</i>; the old past participle of
  <i>bake</i> was <i>baken</i> or <i>bake</i>, as it was a strong verb.
  <i>Baked meats</i> = meats baked in <i>coffins</i> (pies). Cf. Hamlet, i.

  <p>345. The verb <i>snewed</i> may be explained as a metaphor from
  snowing; in fact, the M.&nbsp;E. <i>snewe</i>, like the Prov. Eng. <i>snie</i>
  or <i>snive</i>, also signifies <i>to abound, swarm</i>. Camb. MS. reads
  'It snowede in his mouth of mete and drynk.' Cf. 'He was with yiftes

  <p>349. <i>mewe.</i> The <i>mewe</i> was the place where the hawks were
  kept while moulting; it was afterwards applied to the <i>coop</i> wherein
  fowl were fattened, and lastly to a place of confinement or secrecy.</p>

  <p>350. <i>stewe</i>, fish-pond. 'To insure a supply of fish, stew-ponds
  were attached to the manors, and few monasteries were without them; the
  moat around the castle was often converted into a fish-pond, and well
  stored with luce, carp, or tench.'&mdash;Our English Home, p. 65.</p>

  <p><i>breem</i>, bream; <i>luce</i>, pike, from O. F. <i>luce</i>, Low
  Lat. <i>lucius</i>.</p>

  <p>351. <i>Wo was his cook</i>, woeful or sad was his cook. We now only
  use <i>wo</i> or <i>woe</i> as a substantive. Cf. B. 757, E. 753; and 'I
  am <i>woe</i> for 't'; Tempest, v. 1. 139.</p>

  <p>'Who was <i>woo</i> but Olyvere then?'&mdash;Sowdone of Babyloyne, l.
  1271. Rob. of Brunne, in his Handlyng Synne, l. 7250, says that a rich
  man's cook 'may no day Greythe hym hys mete to pay.'</p>

  <p><i>but-if</i>, unless.</p>

  <p>351, 352. <i>sauce&mdash;Poynaunt</i> is like the modern phrase
  <i>sauce piquante</i>. Cf. B. 4024. 'Our forefathers were great lovers of
  "piquant sauce." They made it of expensive condiments and rare
  spices.'&mdash;Our English Home, p. 62.</p>

  <p>353. <i>table dormant</i>, irremoveable table. 'Previous to the
  fourteenth century a pair of common wooden trestles and a rough plank was
  deemed a table sufficient for the great hall.... Tables, with a board
  attached to a frame, were introduced about the time of Chaucer, and, from
  remaining in the hall, were regarded as indications of a ready
  hospitality.'&mdash;Our English Home, p. 29. Most tables were removeable;
  such a table was called a <i>bord</i> (board).</p>

  <p>355. <i>sessiouns.</i> At the Sessions of the Peace, at the meeting of
  the Justices of the Peace. Cf. '<i>At Sessions</i> and at Sises we bare
  the stroke and swaye.'&mdash;Higgins' Mirrour for Magistrates, ed. 1571,
  p. 2.</p>

  <p>356. <i>knight of the shire</i>, the designation given to the
  representative in parliament of an English county at large, as
  distinguished from the representatives of such counties and towns as are
  counties of themselves (Ogilvie). Chaucer was knight of the shire of Kent
  in 1386.</p>

  <p><i>tym-e</i> here represents the A. S. <i>t&#x12B;man</i>, pl. of
  <i>t&#x12B;ma</i>, a time.</p>

  <p>357. <i>anlas</i> or <i>anelace</i>. Speght defines this word as a
  <i>falchion</i>, or wood-knife. It was, however, a short two-edged knife
  or dagger usually worn at the girdle, broad at the hilt and tapering to a
  point. See the New Eng. Dictionary; Liber Albus, p. 75; Knight, Pict.
  Hist. of England, i. 872; Gloss. to Matthew Paris, s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>anelacius</i>; Riley's <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>[35]</span>Memorials of London, p. 15. The etymology is
  unknown; I <i>guess</i> it to be from M.&nbsp;E. <i>an</i>, on, and
  <i>las</i>, a lace, i.&nbsp;e. 'on a lace,' a dagger that hung from a lace
  attached to the girdle. Cf. A.&nbsp;S. <i>bigyrdel</i> (just below); and
  'hanging on a laas' in l. 392.</p>

  <p><i>gipser</i> was properly a pouch or budget used in hawking, &amp;c.,
  but commonly worn by the merchant, or with any secular
  attire.&mdash;(Way.) It answers to F. <i>gibecière</i>, a pouch; from
  O.&nbsp;F. <i>gibe</i>, a bunch (Scheler). In Riley's Memorials of London, p.
  398, under the date 1376, there is a mention of 'purses called
  <i>gibesers</i>.' In the Bury Wills, p. 37, l. 16, under the date 1463,
  we find&mdash;'My best <i>gypcer</i> with iij. bagges.' The A. S. name
  was <i>bigyrdel</i>, from its hanging <i>by the girdle</i>, as said in l.
  358; it occurs in the A.&nbsp;S. version of Matt. x. 9; and in P. Plowman, B.
  viii. 87.</p>

  <p>358. <i>Heng</i> (or <i>Heeng</i>), the past tense of <i>hongen</i> or
  <i>hangen</i>, to hang.</p>

  <p><i>morne milk</i> = morning-milk; as in A. 3236. 'As white as milke';
  Ritson's Met. Romances, iii. 292.</p>

  <p>359. <i>shirreve</i>, the <i>reve</i> of a <i>shire</i>, governor of a
  county; our modern word <i>sheriff</i>.</p>

  <p><i>countour</i>, O. Fr. <i>comptour</i>, an accountant, a person who
  audited accounts or received money in charge, &amp;c.; ranked with
  pleaders in Riley's Memorials of London, p. 58. It occurs in Rob. of
  Gloucester, l. 11153. In the Book of the Duch. 435, it simply means
  'accountant.' Perhaps it here means 'auditor.' 'Or stewards,
  <i>countours</i>, or pleadours'; Plowman's Tale, pt. iii. st. 13.</p>

  <p>360. <i>vavasour</i>, or <i>vavaser</i>, originally a sub-vassal or
  tenant of a vassal or tenant of the king's, one who held his lands in
  fealty. '<i>Vavasor</i>, one that in dignities is next to a Baron';
  Cowel. Strutt (Manners and Customs, iii. 14) explains that a
  <i>vavasour</i> was 'a tenant by knight's service, who did not hold
  immediately of the king <i>in capite</i>, but of some mesne lord, which
  excluded him from the dignity of baron by tenure.' Tyrwhitt says 'it
  should be understood to mean the whole class of middling landholders.'
  See Lacroix, Military Life of Middle Ages, p. 9. Spelt <i>favasour</i> in
  King Alisaunder, ed. Weber, l. 3827. A. F. <i>uauassur</i>; Laws of Will.

<p class="ac"><b>The Haberdassher and others.</b></p>

  <p>361. <i>Haberdassher.</i> Haberdashers were of two kinds: haberdashers
  of small wares&mdash;sellers of needles, tapes, buttons, &amp;c.; and
  haberdashers of hats. The stuff called <i>hapertas</i> is mentioned in
  the Liber Albus, p. 225.</p>

  <p>362. <i>Webbe</i>, properly a male weaver; <i>webstere</i> was the
  female weaver, but there appears to have been some confusion in the use
  of the suffixes <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> and <i><span
  class="nw">-stere</span></i>; see Piers Plowman, ed. Skeat, B. v. 215:
  'mi <i>wyf</i> was a <i>webbe</i>.' Hence the names <i>Webb</i> and
  <i>Webster</i>. Cf. <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>[36]</span>A. S. <i>webba</i>, m., a weaver;
  <i>webbestere</i>, fem. <i>tapicer</i>, upholsterer; F. <i>tapis</i>,
  carpet.</p>

  <p>363. <i>liveree</i>, livery. 'Under the term "livery" was included
  whatever was dispensed (<i>delivered</i>) by the lord to his officials or
  domestics annually or at certain seasons, whether money, victuals, or
  garments. The term chiefly denoted external marks of distinction, such as
  the <i>roba estivalis</i> and <i>hiemalis</i>, given to the officers and
  retainers of the court.... The Stat. 7 Hen. IV expressly permits the
  adoption of such distinctive dress by fraternities and "<i>les gentz de
  mestere</i>," the trades of the cities of the realm, being ordained with
  good intent; and to this prevalent usage Chaucer alludes when he
  describes five artificers of various callings, who joined the pilgrimage,
  clothed all <i>in o lyveré of a solempne and greet
  fraternité</i>.'&mdash;Way, note to Prompt. Parv., p. 308. We still speak
  of the Livery Companies.</p>

  <p><i>And they were clothed alle</i> (Elles., &amp;c.); <i>Weren with vss
  eeke clothed</i> (Harl.) The former reading leaves the former clause of
  the sentence without a verb.</p>

  <p>364. <i>fraternitee</i>, guild: see English Gilds, ed. Toulmin Smith,
  pp. xxx, xxxix, cxxii. Each guild had its own livery; Rock, Church of our
  Fathers, ii. 412.</p>

  <p>365. <i>gere</i>, gear, apparel. <i>apyked</i>, signifies cleaned,
  trimmed, like Shakespeare's <i>picked</i>. Cotgrave gives as senses of F.
  <i>piquer</i>, 'to quilt,' and 'to stiffen a coller.'</p>

  <p>366. <i>y-chaped</i>, having <i>chapes</i> (i.&nbsp;e. plates or
  <i>caps</i> of metal at the point of the sheath or scabbard). Tradesmen
  and mechanics were prohibited from using knives adorned with silver,
  gold, or precious stones. So that Chaucer's pilgrims were of a superior
  estate, as is indicated in l. 369. Cf. <i>chapeless</i>, Taming of the
  Shrew, iii. 2. 48.</p>

  <p>370. <i>deys</i>, <i>dese</i>, or <i>dais</i> (Fr. <i>deis</i>, from
  Lat. <i>discum</i>, acc.), is used to denote the raised platform which
  was always found at the upper end of a hall, on which the high table was
  placed; originally, it meant the high table itself. In modern French and
  English, it is used of a canopy or 'tester' over a seat of state.
  Tyrwhitt's account of the word is confused, as he starts with a false
  etymology.</p>

  <p><i>yeld-halle</i>, guild-hall. See <i>Gildhall</i> in the Index to E.
  Gilds, ed. Toulmin Smith.</p>

  <p>371. <i>that he can</i>, that he knows; so also <i>as he couthe</i>,
  as he knew how, in l. 390. This line is deficient in the first foot.</p>

  <p>372. <i>shaply</i>, adapted, fit; sometimes comely, of good
  <i>shape</i>. The mention of <i>alderman</i> should be noted. It was the
  invariable title given to one who was chosen as the head or principal of
  a guild (see English Gilds, ed. Toulmin Smith, pp. ciii, 36, 148, 276,
  446). All these men belonged to a fraternity or guild, and each of them
  was a fit man to be chosen as head of it.</p>

  <p>373. 'For they had sufficient property and income' (to entitle them to
  undertake such an office).</p>

  <p>376. <i>y-clept</i>, called; pp. of <i>clepen</i>; see l. 121. <!--

  <p>377. <i>And goon to vigilyes al bifore.</i> 'It was the manner in
  times past, upon festival evens, called <i>vigiliæ</i>, for parishioners
  to meet in their church-houses or church-yards, and there to have a
  drinking-fit for the time. Here they used to end many quarrels betwixt
  neighbour and neighbour. Hither came the wives in comely manner, and they
  which were of the better sort had their mantles carried with them, as
  well for show as to keep them from cold at table.'&mdash;Speght, Gl. to
  Chaucer.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Cook.</b></p>

  <p>379. <i>for the nones</i> = <i>for the nonce</i>; this expression, if
  grammatically written, would be <i>for then once</i>, M.&nbsp;E. <i>for þan
  anes</i>, for the once, i.&nbsp;e. for the occasion; where the adv.
  <i>anes</i> (orig. a gen. form) is used as if it were a sb. in the dat.
  case. Cf. M.&nbsp;E. <i>atte</i> = <i>atten</i>, A.&nbsp;S. <i>æt

  <p>381. <i>poudre-marchaunt tart</i> is a sharp (tart) kind of flavouring
  powder, twice mentioned in Household Ordinances and Receipts (Soc. Antiq.
  1790) at pp. 425, 434: 'Do therto <i>pouder marchant</i>,' and 'do thi
  flessh therto, and gode herbes and <i>poudre marchaunt</i>, and let hit
  well stew.'&mdash;Notes and Queries, Fourth Series, iii. 180. See
  <i>Powder</i> in the Glossary to the Babees Book.</p>

  <p>'<i>Galingale</i>, which Chaucer, pre-eminentest, economioniseth above
  all junquetries or confectionaries whatsoever.'&mdash;Nash's Lenten
  Stuff, p. 36, ed. Hindley. <i>Galingale</i> is the root of sweet cyperus.
  Harman (ed. Strother) notices three varieties: <i>Cyperus rotundus</i>,
  <i>Galanga major</i>, <i>Galanga minor</i>; Babees Book, ed. Furnivall,
  pp. 152, 216. See also Marco Polo, ed. Yule, ii. 181; Prompt. Parv., p.
  185, note 4; Rogers, Hist. of Agriculture and Prices, i. 629; &amp;c. And
  see Dr. H. Fletcher Hance's and Mr. Daniel Hanbury's Papers on this spice
  in the Linnæan Society's Journal, 1871.</p>

  <p>382. <i>London ale.</i> London ale was famous as early as the time of
  Henry III., and much higher priced than any other ale; cf. A. 3140.</p>

  <p><i>Wel coude he knowe</i>, he well knew how to distinguish. In fact,
  we find, in the Manciple's Prologue (H. 57), that the Cook loved good ale
  only too well.</p>

  <p>384. <i>mortreux</i> or <i>mortrewes</i>. There were two kinds of
  'mortrews,' 'mortrewes de chare' and 'mortrewes of fysshe.' The first was
  a kind of soup in which chickens, fresh pork, crumbs of bread, yolks of
  eggs, and saffron formed the chief ingredients; the second kind was a
  soup containing the roe (or milt) and liver of fish, bread, pepper, ale.
  The ingredients were first stamped or brayed in a <i>mortar</i>, whence
  it probably derived its name. Lord Bacon (Nat. Hist. i. 48) speaks of 'a
  <i>mortresse</i> made with the brawne of capons stamped and strained.'
  See Babees Book, pp. 151, 170, 172; Liber Cure Cocorum, ed. Morris, pp.
  9, 19; and the note to P. Plowman, C. xvi. 47. This line, like ll. 371
  and 391, is deficient in the first foot.</p>

  <p>386. <i>mormal</i>, a cancer or gangrene. Ben Jonson, in imitation of
  <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  'old <i>mortmal</i> on his shin'; Sad Shepherd, act ii. sc. 2. Lydgate
  speaks of 'Goutes, <i>mormalles</i>, horrible to the sight'; Falls of
  Princes, bk. vii. c. 10. In Polit. Religious and Love Poems, ed.
  Furnivall, p. 218, we are told that the sin of Luxury 'ys a lyther
  <i>mormale</i>.' In Skelton's Magnificence, l. 1932, Adversity is made to
  say&mdash;'Some with the <i>marmoll</i> to halte I them make'; and it is
  remarkable that Palsgrave gives both&mdash;'<i>Mormall</i>, a sore,' and
  '<i>Marmoll</i>, a sore'; the latter being plainly a corrupt form. See
  also Prompt. Parvulorum, p. 343, note 5. In MS. Oo. i. 20, last leaf, in
  the Camb. Univ. Library, are notices of remedies 'Por la maladie que est
  apele <i>malum mortuum</i>.' The MS. says that it comes from melancholy,
  and shows a broad hard scurf or crust.</p>

  <p>387. <i>blank-manger</i>, a compound made of capon minced, with rice,
  milk, sugar, and almonds; see Liber Cure Cocorum, ed. Morris, p. 9. Named
  from its white colour.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Shipman.</b></p>

  <p>See the essay on Chaucer's Shipman in Essays on Chaucer, p. 455.</p>

  <p>388. <i>woning</i>, dwelling; from A. S. <i>wunian</i>, to dwell.</p>

  <p><i>by weste</i> = <i>westward</i>. A good old expression, which was
  once very common as late as the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>389. Dartmouth was once a very considerable port; see Essays on
  Chaucer, p. 456. Compare the account of the Shipman's Gild at Lynn; E.
  Gilds, p. 54.</p>

  <p>390. <i>rouncy</i>, a common hackney horse, a nag. Cf.
  <i>Rozinante</i>. '<i>Rocinante</i>&mdash;significativo de lo que habia
  sido cuando fué <i>rocin, antes</i> de lo que ahora era.' Don Quijote,
  cap. 1. 'From <i>Rozin</i>, a drudge-horse, and <i>ante</i>, before.'
  Jarvis's note. The O.&nbsp;F. form is <i>roncin</i>; Low Lat. <i>runcinus</i>.
  The <i>rouncy</i> was chiefly used for agricultural work; see Essays on
  Chaucer, p. 494.</p>

  <p><i>as he couthe</i>, as he knew how; but, as a sailor, his knowledge
  this way was deficient.</p>

  <p>391. <i>a goune of falding</i>, a gown (robe) of coarse cloth. The
  term <i>falding</i> signifies 'a kind of frieze or rough-napped cloth,'
  which was probably 'supplied from the North of Europe, and identical with
  the woollen wrappers of which Hermoldus speaks, "<i>quos nos appellamus
  Faldones</i>."'&mdash;Way. '<i>Falding</i> was a coarse serge cloth, very
  rough and durable,' &amp;c.; Essays on Chaucer, p. 438. In MS. O. 5. 4,
  in Trinity College, Cambridge, occurs the entry&mdash;'Amphibulus, vestis
  equi villosa, anglice <i>a sclauayn or faldyng</i>'; cited in Furnivall's
  Temporary Preface, p. 99. In 1392, I find a mention of 'unam tunicam de
  nigro <i>faldyng</i> lineatam'; Testamenta Eboracensia, i. 173. Hence its
  colour was sometimes black, and the Shipman's gown is so coloured in the
  drawing in the Ellesmere MS.; but see A. 3212. See the whole of Way's
  long note in the Prompt. Parvulorum. <!-- Page 39 --><span

  <p>392. <i>laas</i>, lace, cord. Seamen still carry their knives
  slung.</p>

  <p>394. <i>the hote somer.</i> 'Perhaps this is a reference to the summer
  of the year 1351, which was long remembered as the dry and hot
  summer.'&mdash;Wright. There was another such summer in 1370, much nearer
  the date of this Prologue. But it may be a mere general expression.</p>

  <p>395. <i>a good felawe</i>, a merry companion; as in l. 648.</p>

  <p>396-8. 'Very many a draught of wine had he drawn (stolen away or
  carried off) from Bordeaux, cask and all, while the chapman (merchant or
  supercargo to whom the wine belonged) was asleep; for he paid no regard
  to any conscientious scruples.'</p>

  <p><i>took keep</i>; cf. F. <i>prendre garde</i>.</p>

  i.&nbsp;e. he made them 'walk the plank,' as it used to be called; or, in
  plain English, threw them overboard, to sink or swim. However cruel this
  may seem now, it was probably a common practice. 'This battle (the
  sea-fight off Sluys) was very murderous and horrible. Combats at sea are
  more destructive and obstinate than upon land'; Froissart's Chron. bk. i.
  c. 50. See Minot's Poems, ed. Hall, p. 16. In Wright's History of
  Caricature, p. 204, is an anecdote of the way in which the defeat of the
  French at Sluys was at last revealed to the king of France, Philippe VI.,
  by the court-jester, who alone dared to communicate the news. 'Entering
  the King's chamber, he continued muttering to himself, but loud enough to
  be heard&mdash;"Those cowardly English! the chicken-hearted English!"
  "How so, cousin?" the king inquired. "Why," replied the fool, "because
  they have not courage enough <i>to jump into the sea</i>, like your
  French soldiers, who went over headlong from their ships, leaving them to
  the enemy, who had <i>no inclination to follow them</i>." Philippe thus
  became aware of the full extent of his calamity.' And see Essays on
  Chaucer, p. 460.</p>

  <p>402. <i>stremes</i>, currents. <i>him bisydes</i>, ever near at

  <p>403. <i>herberwe</i>, harbour; see note to l. 765. <i>mone</i>, moon,
  time of the lunation.</p>

  <p><i>lodemenage</i>, pilotage. A pilot was called a <i>lodesman</i>; see
  Way's note in Prompt. Parv. p. 310; Riley's Memorials of London, p. 655;
  Chaucer's Legend of Good Women, 1488. Furnivall's Temporary Preface, p.
  98, gives the Lat. form as <i>lodmannus</i>, whence <i>lodmannagium</i>,
  pilotage, examples of which are given. Sometimes, <i>lodesman</i> meant
  any guide or conductor, as in Rob. of Brunne, Handlyng Synne, 9027; Monk
  of Evesham, ed. Arber, p. 106. M.&nbsp;E. <i>lode</i> is the A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>l&#x101;d</i>, a way, a course, the sb. whence the verb to <i>lead</i>
  is derived. It is itself derived from A.&nbsp;S. <i>l&#x12B;ðan</i>, to
  travel.</p>

  moment of birth. Upon it depended the drawing out of a man's horoscope,
  which represented the aspect of the heavens at some given critical
  moment. The moment, in the present case, is that for making images. It
  was believed that images of men and animals could be made of certain
  substances and <i>at certain times</i>, and could be so treated as to
  cause good or evil to a patient, by means of magical and planetary
  influences. See Cornelius Agrippa, De Occulta Philosophia, lib. ii. capp.

  <p>420. These are the <i>four</i> elementary qualities, hot, cold, dry,
  moist; <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>[41]</span>Milton, Par. Lost, ii. 898. Diseases were
  supposed to be caused by an undue excess of some one quality; and the
  mixture of prevalent qualities in a man's body determined his complexion
  or temperament. Thus the <i>sanguine</i> man was thought to be hot and
  moist; the <i>phlegmatic</i>, cold and moist; the <i>choleric</i>, hot
  and dry; the <i>melancholy</i>, cold and dry. The whole system rested on
  the teaching of Galen, and was fundamentally wrong, as it assumed that
  the 'elements,' or 'simple bodies,' were four, viz. earth, air, fire, and
  water. Of these, earth was said to be cold and dry; water, cold and
  moist; air, hot and moist; and fire, hot and dry. They thus correspond to
  the four complexions, viz. melancholy, phlegmatic, sanguine, and
  choleric. Each principal part of the body, as the brain, heart, liver,
  stomach, &amp;c., could be 'distempered,' and such distemperance could be
  either 'simple' or 'compound.' Thus a simple distemperature of the brain
  might be 'an excess of heat'; a compound one, 'an excess of heat and
  moisture.' See the whole system explained in Sir Thos. Elyot's Castel of
  Helthe; at the beginning.</p>

  <p>429-34. Read <i>th'oldë</i>. 'The authors mentioned here wrote the
  chief medical text-books of the middle ages. Rufus was a Greek physician
  of Ephesus, of the age of Trajan; Haly, Serapion, and Avicen (Ebn Sina)
  were Arabian physicians and astronomers of the eleventh century; Rhasis
  was a Spanish Arab of the tenth century; and Averroes (Ebn Roschd) was a
  Moorish scholar who flourished in Morocco in the twelfth century.
  Johannes Damascenus was also an Arabian physician, but of a much earlier
  date (probably of the ninth century). Constanti[n]us Afer, a native of
  Carthage, and afterwards a monk of Monte Cassino, was one of the founders
  of the school of Salerno&mdash;he lived at the end of the eleventh
  century. Bernardus Gordonius, professor of medicine at Montpellier,
  appears to have been Chaucer's contemporary. John Gatisden was a
  distinguished physician of Oxford in the earlier half of the fourteenth
  century. Gilbertyn is supposed by Warton to be the celebrated Gilbertus
  Anglicus. The names of Hippocrates and Galen were, in the middle ages,
  always (or nearly always) spelt Ypocras and Galienus.'&mdash;Wright. Cf.
  C. 306. Æsculapius, god of medicine, was fabled to be the son of Apollo.
  Dioscorides was a Greek physician of the second century. See the long
  note in Warton, 1871, ii. 368; and the account in Saunders' <!-- Page 42

  p. 115. I may note here, that Haly wrote a commentary on Galen, and is
  mentioned in Skelton's Philip Sparowe, l. 505. There were three
  Serapions; the one here meant was probably John Serapion, in the eleventh
  century. Averroes wrote a commentary on the works of Aristotle, and died
  about 1198. Constantinus is the same as 'the cursed monk Dan Constantyn,'
  mentioned in the Marchaunt's Tale, E. 1810. John Gatisden was a fellow of
  Merton College, and 'was court-doctor under Edw. II. He wrote a treatise
  on medicine called <i>Rosa Anglica</i>'; J. Jusserand, Eng. Wayfaring
  Life, (1889), p. 180. Cf. Book of the Duchess, 572. Dante, Inf. iv. 143,

  Rock shews how the bishop (or officiating priest) 'took from the people's
  selves their offerings of bread and wine.... The men first and then the
  women, came with their cake and cruse of wine.' So that, instead of money
  being collected, as now, the people went up in order with their
  offerings; and questions of precedence of course arose. The Wife insisted
  on going up first among the women. See Rock, Church of our Fathers, iii.

  Tyrwhitt was not justified in altering <i>ten pound</i> into <i>a

  nothing, as will be readily understood by observing the huge structures
  represented in Fairholt's Costume, figs. 125, 129, 130, 151, which were

  This expression (copied from Le Rom. de la Rose, l. 12985&mdash;'autre

  opening, and is allied to E. <i>gate</i>. The Friesic <i>gat</i>, Dan.,
  Du., and Icel. <i>gat</i>, and Norweg. <i>gat</i>, all mean a hole, or a
  gap. Very similar is the use of the Shropshire <i>glat</i>, a gap in a
  hedge, also a gap in the mouth caused by loss of teeth. Example: 'Dick,
  yo' bin a flirt; I thought yo' wun (<i>were</i>) gwein to marry the cook
  at the paas'n's. Aye, but 'er'd gotten too many <i>glats</i> i' the mouth

  <i>goat-toothed</i>, lascivious, but the word <i>goat</i> appears as
  <i>goot</i> in Chaucer.] Perhaps the following piece of 'folk-lore' will
  help us out. 'A young lady the other day, in reply to an observation of
  mine&mdash;"What a lucky girl you are!"&mdash;replied; "So they used to
  say I should be when at school." "Why?" "Because my teeth were set <i>so
  far apart; it was a sure sign I should be lucky and
  travel</i>."'&mdash;Notes &amp; Queries 1 Ser. <!-- Page 45 --><span

  Ser. vii. 306. The last quotation shews that the stop after <i>weye</i>
  at the end of l. 467 should be a mere semicolon; since ll. 467 and 468
  are closely connected.</p>

  <p>469. <i>amblere</i>, an ambling horse.</p>

  <p>470. <i>Y-wimpled</i>, covered with a wimple; see l. 151.</p>

  <p>471. <i>targe</i>, target, shield.</p>

  <p>472. <i>foot-mantel.</i> Tyrwhitt supposes this to be a sort of
  <i>riding-petticoat</i>, such as is now used by market-women. It is
  clearly shewn, as a blue outer skirt, in the drawing in the Ellesmere MS.
  At a later time it was called a <i>safe-guard</i> (see Nares), and its
  use was to keep the gown clean. It may be added that, in the Ellesmere
  MS., the Wife is represented as riding astride. Hence she wanted 'a pair
  of spurs.'</p>

  <p>474. <i>carpe</i>, prate, discourse; Icel. <i>karpa</i>, to brag. The
  present sense of <i>carp</i> seems to be due to Lat. <i>carpere</i>.</p>

  <p>475. <i>remedyes.</i> An allusion to the title and subject of Ovid's
  book, Remedia Amoris.</p>

  <p>476. <i>the olde daunce</i>, the old game, or custom. The phrase is
  borrowed from Le Roman de la Rose, l. 3946&mdash;'Qu'el scet toute la
  vielle dance'; E. version, l. 4300&mdash;'For she knew al the olde
  daunce.' It occurs again; Troil. iii. 695. And in Troil. ii. 1106, we
  have the phrase <i>loves daunce</i>. Cf. <i>the amorouse daunce</i>,
  Troil. iv. 1431.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Persoun.</b></p>

  <p>478. <i>Persoun of a toun</i>, the parson or parish priest. Chaucer,
  in his description of the parson, contrasts the piety and industry of the
  secular clergy with the wickedness and laziness of the religious orders
  or monks. See Dryden's 'Character of a Good Parson,' and Goldsmith's
  'Deserted Village'; also Wyclif, ed. Matthew, p. 179.</p>

  <p>482. <i>parisshens</i>, parishioners; in which <i><span
  class="nw">-er</span></i> is a later suffix.</p>

  <p>485. <i>y-preved</i>, proved (to be). <i>ofte sythes</i>, often-times;
  from A.&nbsp;S. <i>s&#x12B;ð</i>, a time.</p>

  <p>486. 'He was very loath to excommunicate those who failed to pay the
  tithes that were due to him.' 'Refusal to pay tithes was punishable with
  the lesser excommunication'; Bell. Wyclif complains of 'weiward curatis'
  that 'sclaundren here parischenys many weies by ensaumple of pride,
  enuye, coueitise and vnresonable vengaunce, so cruely cursynge for
  tithes'; Works, ed. Matthew, p. 144 (cf. p. 132).</p>

  <p>487. <i>yeven</i>, give; A. S. <i>gifan</i>. <i>out of doute</i>,
  without doubt.</p>

  <p>489. <i>offring</i>, the voluntary contributions of his
  parishioners.</p>

  <p><i>substaunce</i>, income derived from his benefice.</p>

  <p>490. <i>suffisaunce</i>, a sufficiency; enough to live on.</p>

  <p>492. <i>lafte not</i>, left not, ceased not; from M. E.
  <i>leven</i>.</p>

  <p>493. <i>meschief</i>, mishap, misfortune.</p>

  <p>494. <i>ferreste</i>, farthest; superl. of <i>fer</i>, far.
  <i>muche</i>, great. <i>lyte</i>, small; A. S. <i>lyt</i>, small, little.
  <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>[46]</span></p>

  <p>497. <i>wroghte</i>, wrought, worked; pt. t. of <i>werchen</i>, to
  work.</p>

  <p>498. The allusion is to Matt. v. 19, as shewn by a parallel passage in
  P. Plowman, C. xvi. 127.</p>

  <p>502. <i>lewed</i>, unlearned, ignorant. <i>Lewed</i> or <i>lewd</i>
  originally signified the people, laity, as opposed to the clergy; the
  modern sense of the word is not common in Middle English. Cf. mod. E.
  <i>lewd</i>, in Acts xvii. 5. See <i>Lewd</i> in Trench, Select
  Glossary.</p>

  <p>503-4. <i>if a preest tak-e keep</i>, if a priest may (i.&nbsp;e. will) but
  pay heed to it. St. John Chrysostom also saith, 'It is a great shame for
  priests, when laymen be found faithfuller and more righteous than
  they.'&mdash;Becon's Invective against Swearing, p. 336.</p>

  <p>507. <i>to hyre.</i> The parson did not leave his parish duties to be
  performed by a stranger, that he might have leisure to seek a chantry in
  St. Paul's. See Piers Plowman, B-text, Prol. l. 83; Hoccleve, De Regimine
  Principum, ed. Wright, pp. 51, 52; Spenser, Shep. Kalendar (May).</p>

  <p>508. <i>And leet</i>, and left (not). We should now
  say&mdash;'<i>Nor</i> left.' So also, in l. 509, <i>And ran</i> = Nor
  ran. <i>Leet</i> is the pt. t. of <i>leten</i>, to let alone, let go.</p>

  <p>509. Here again, <i>së-ynt</i> is used as if it were dissyllabic; see
  ll. 120, 697.</p>

  <p>510. <i>chaunterie</i>, chantry; an endowment for the payment of a
  priest to sing mass, agreeably to the appointment of the founder. 'There
  were thirty-five of these chantries established at St. Paul's, which were
  served by fifty-four priests; Dugd. Hist. pref. p. 41.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt's
  Glossary. On the difference between a <i>gild</i> and a <i>chantry</i>,
  see the instructive remarks in Eng. Gilds, ed. Toulmin Smith, pp.
  205-207, 259.</p>

  <p>511. 'Or to be kept (i.&nbsp;e. remain) in retirement along with some
  fraternity.' I do not see how <i>with-holde</i> can mean 'maintained,' as
  it is usually explained. Cf. <i>dwelte</i> in l. 512, and
  <i>with-holde</i> in G. 345.</p>

  <p>514. <i>no mercenarie</i>, no hireling; see John x. 12, where the
  Vulgate version has <i>mercenarius</i>.</p>

  <p>516. <i>despitous</i>, full of <i>despite</i>, or contempt; cf. E.
  <i>spite</i>.</p>

  <p>517. <i>daungerous</i>, not affable, difficult to approach. Cf. Rom.
  of the Rose, l. 591:&mdash;'Ne of hir answer <i>daungerous</i>'; where
  the original has <i>desdaigneuse</i>. <i>digne</i>, full of dignity;
  hence, repellent. 'She was as <i>digne</i> as water in a dich,' A. 3964;
  because stagnant water keeps people at a distance.</p>

  <p>519. <i>fairnesse</i>, i.&nbsp;e. by leading a fair or good life. The
  Harleian MS. has <i>clennesse</i>, that is, a life of purity.</p>

  <p>523. <i>snibben</i>, reprimand; cf. Dan. <i>snibbe</i>, to rebuke,
  scold; mod. E. <i>snub</i>. In Wyclif's translation of Matt, xviii. 15,
  the earlier version has <i>snybbe</i> as a synonym for
  <i>reprove</i>.</p>

  <p><i>nones</i>; see l. 379, and the note.</p>

  <p>525. <i>wayted after</i>, looked for. See line 571.</p>

  <p>526. <i>spyced conscience</i>; so also in D. 435. <i>Spiced</i> here
  seems to signify, says Tyrwhitt, nice, scrupulous; for a reason which is
  given <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The origin of the phrase is French. The name of <i>espices</i>
  (spices) was given to the fees or dues which were payable (in advance) to
  judges. A 'spiced' judge, who would have a 'spiced' conscience, was
  scrupulous and exact, because he had been prepaid, and was inaccessible
  to any but large bribes. See Cotgrave, s.&nbsp;v. <i>espices</i>; Littré,
  s.&nbsp;v. <i>épice</i>; and, in particular, Les &OElig;uvres de Guillaume
  Coquillart, ed. P. Tarbé, t. i. p. 31, and t. ii. p. 114. (First
  explained by me in a letter to The Athenaeum, Nov. 26, 1892, p. 741.)</p>

  <p>559. <i>forneys.</i> 'Why, asks Mr. Earle, should Chaucer so readily
  fall on the simile of a <i>furnace</i>? What, in the uses of the time,
  made it come so ready to hand? The weald of Kent was then, like our
  "black country" now, a great smelting district, its wood answering to our
  coal; and Chaucer was Knight of the Shire, or M.P. for
  Kent.'&mdash;Temporary Preface to the Six-text edition of Chaucer's
  Canterbury Tales, p. 99.</p>

  <p>560. <i>Ianglere</i>, loud talker.</p>

  <p><i>goliardeys</i>, a ribald jester, one who gained his living by
  following rich men's tables, and telling tales and making sport for the
  guests. Tyrwhitt says, 'This jovial sect seems to have been so called
  from <i>Golias</i>, the real or assumed name of a man of wit, towards the
  end of the twelfth century, who wrote the Apocalypsis Goliæ, and other
  pieces in burlesque Latin rhymes, some which have been falsely [?]
  attributed to Walter Map.' But it would appear that <i>Golias</i> is the
  sole invention of Walter Map, the probable author of the 'Golias' poems.
  See Morley's Eng. Writers, 1888, iii. 167, where we read that the
  Apocalypse of Golias and the confession of Golias 'have by constant
  tradition been ascribed to him [Walter Map]; never to any other writer.'
  Golias is a medieval spelling of the Goliath of scripture, and occurs in
  Chaucer, Man of Lawes Tale, B. 934. In several authors of the thirteenth
  century, quoted by Du Cange, the <i>goliardi</i> are classed with the
  <i>joculatores et buffones</i>, and it is very likely that the word
  <i>goliardus</i> was, originally, quite independent of <i>Golias</i>,
  which was only connected with it by way of jest. The word
  <i>goliardus</i> seems rather to have meant, originally, 'glutton,' and
  to be connected with <i>gula</i>, the throat; but it was quite a common
  term, in the thirteenth century, for certain men of some education but of
  bad repute, who composed or recited satirical <!-- Page 49 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>[49]</span>parodies and coarse
  verses and epigrams for the amusement of the rich. See T. Wright's
  Introduction to the poems of Walter Map (Camden Soc.); P. Plowman, ed.
  Skeat, note to B. prol. 139; Wright's History of Caricature, ch. X; and
  the account in Godefroy's O. French Dict., s.&nbsp;v. <i>Goliard</i>.</p>

  <p>561. <i>that</i>, i.&nbsp;e. his 'Iangling,' his noisy talk.</p>

  <p><i>harlotrye</i> means scurrility; Wyclif (Eph. v. 4) so translates
  Lat. <i>scurrilitas</i>.</p>

  <p>562. 'Besides the usual payment in money for grinding corn, millers
  are always allowed what is called "toll," amounting to 4 lbs. out of
  every sack of flour.'&mdash;Bell. But it can hardly be doubted that, in
  old times, the toll was wholly in corn, not in money at all. It amounted,
  in fact, to the twentieth or twenty-fourth part of the corn ground,
  according to the strength of the water-course; see Strutt, Manners and
  Customs, ii. 82, and Nares, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Toll-dish</i>. At Berwick, the
  miller's share was reckoned as 'the thirteenth part for grain, and the
  twenty-fourth part for malt.' Eng. Gilds, p. 342. When the miller 'tolled
  thrice,' he took thrice the legal allowance. Cf. A. 3939, 3940.</p>

  <p>563. <i>a thombe of gold.</i> An explanation of this proverb is given
  on the authority of Mr. Constable, the Royal Academician, by Mr. Yarrell
  in his History of British Fishes, who, when speaking of the Bullhead or
  <i>Miller's Thumb</i>, explains that a miller's thumb acquires a peculiar
  shape by continually feeling samples of corn whilst it is being ground;
  and that such a thumb is called <i>golden</i>, with reference to the
  profit that is the reward of the experienced miller's skill.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Ray's Proverbs give us&mdash;'An honest miller has a golden thumb';
  ed. 1768, p. 136; taken satirically, this means that there are <i>no</i>
  honest millers. Brand, in his Pop. Antiquities, ed. Ellis, iii. 387,
  quotes from an old play&mdash;'Oh the mooter dish, <i>the miller's
  Thumbe</i>!'</p>

  <p>565. W. Thorpe, when examined by Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, in
  1407, complains of the pilgrims, saying&mdash;'they will ordain to have
  with them both men and women that can well sing wanton songs; and some
  other pilgrims will have with them <i>bagpipes</i>; so that every town
  that they come through, what with the noise of their singing, and with
  the sound of their piping, and with the jangling of their Canterbury
  bells, and with the barking out of dogs after them, they make more noise
  than if the king came there away, with all his clarions and many other
  minstrels.'&mdash;Arber's Eng. Garner, vi. 84; Wordsworth, Eccl.

  <p>615. <i>stot</i>, probably what we should now call a cob. Prof. J. E.
  T. Rogers, in his Hist. of Agriculture, i. 36, supposes that a stot was a
  low-bred undersized stallion. It frequently occurs with the sense of
  'bullock'; see note to P. Plowman, C. xxii. 267.</p>

  <p>616. Sir Topas's horse was 'dappel-gray,' which has the same sense as
  <i>pomely gray</i>, viz. gray dappled with round apple-like spots. 'Apon
  a cowrsowre <i>poumle-gray</i>'; Wyntown, Chron. iv. 217;
  '<i>pomly-gray</i>'; Palladius on Husbandry, bk. iv. l. 809; 'Upon a
  <i>pomely</i> palfray'; Lybeaus Disconus, 844 (in Ritson's Metrical
  Romances). Florio gives Ital. <i>pomellato</i>, 'pide, daple-graie.' The
  word occurs in the French Roman de Troie by Benoît de Sainte-Maure, ed.
  Joly, 10722:&mdash;'Quant Troylus orent monté Sor un cheval <i>sor
  pommelé</i>.' Cf. G. 559.</p>

  <p><i>Scot.</i> 'The name given to the horse of the reeve (who lived at
  Bawdeswell, in Norfolk) is a curious instance of Chaucer's accuracy; for

  <p>621. <i>Tukked aboute</i>, with his long coat tucked up round him by
  help of a girdle. In the pictures in the Ellesmere MS., both the reeve
  and the friar have girdles, and rather long coats; cf. D. 1737. 'He
  (i.&nbsp;e. a friar) wore a graie cote <i>well tucked under his corded
  girdle</i>, with a paire of trime white hose'; W. Bullein, A Dialogue
  against the Feuer (E. E. T. S.), p. 68. See <i>Tuck</i> in Skeat, Etym.

<p class="ac"><b>The Somnour.</b></p>

  <p>623. <i>Somnour</i>, summoner; an officer employed to summon
  delinquents to appear in ecclesiastical courts; now called an apparitor.
  'The ecclesiastical courts ... determined all causes matrimonial and
  testamentary.... They had besides to enforce the payment of tithes <!--
  Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[52]</span>and
  church dues, and were charged with disciplinary power for punishment of
  adultery, fornication, perjury, and other vices which did not come under
  the common law. The reputation of the <i>summoner</i> is enough to show
  how abuses pervaded the action of these courts. Prof. Stubbs has summed
  up the case concerning them in his Constitutional History, iii.
  373.'&mdash;Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, note at p. 514. For further
  information as to the summoner's character, see the Frere's Tale, D.
  1299-1374.</p>

  <p>624. <i>cherubinnes face.</i> H. Stephens, Apologie for Herodotus, i.
  c. 30, quotes the same thought from a French epigram&mdash;'Nos grands
  docteurs <i>au cherubin visage</i>.'&mdash;T. Observe that
  <i>cherubin</i> (put for <i>cherubim</i>) is a plural form. 'As the pl.
  was popularly much better known than the singular (e. g. in the Te Deum),
  the Romanic forms were all fashioned on <i>cherubin</i>, viz. Ital.
  <i>cherubino</i>, Span. <i>querubin</i>, Port. <i>querubin</i>,
  <i>cherubin</i>, F. <i>cherubin</i>'; New English Dictionary. Cherubs
  were generally painted red, a fact which became proverbial, as here.
  Cotgrave has: '<i>Rouge comme un cherubin</i>, red-faced, cherubin-faced,
  having a fierie facies like a Cherubin.' Mrs. Jameson, in her Sacred and
  Legendary Art, has unluckily made the cherubim <i>blue</i>, and the
  seraphim <i>red</i>; the contrary was the accepted rule.</p>

  <p>625. <i>sawcefleem</i> or <i>sawsfleem</i>, having a red pimpled face;
  lit. afflicted with pimples, &amp;c., supposed to be caused by too much
  salt phlegm (<i>salsum phlegma</i>) in the constitution. The four humours
  of the blood, and the four consequent temperaments, are constantly
  referred to in various ways by early writers&mdash;by Chaucer as much as
  by any. Tyrwhitt quotes from an O. French book on physic (in MS. Bodley
  761)&mdash;'Oignement magistrel pur <i>sausefleme</i> et pur chescune
  manere de <i>roigne</i>,' where <i>roigne</i> signifies any scorbutic
  eruption. 'So (he adds) in the Thousand Notable Things, B. i. 70&mdash;"A
  <i>sawsfleame</i> or red pimpled face is helped with this medicine
  following:"&mdash;two of the ingredients are <i>quicksilver</i> and
  <i>brimstone</i>. In another place, B. ii. 20, <i>oyle of tartar</i> is
  said "to take away cleane all spots, freckles, and filthy
  <i>wheales</i>."' He also quotes, in his Glossary, from MS. Bodley
  2463&mdash;'unguentum contra <i>salsum flegma</i>, scabiem, &amp;c.'
  <i>Flewme</i> in the Prompt. Parv. answers to Lat. <i>phlegma</i>. See
  the long note by J. Addis in N. and Q. 4 S. iv. 64; Babees Book, ed.

  108.</p>

  <p>635. See Prov. <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'xxxiii.'."

  appearance. 'Wyne ... makith the uisage <i>salce fleumed</i> [misprinted
  <i>falce flemed</i>], <i>rede</i>, and fulle of <i>white whelkes</i>';
  Knight de la Tour, p. 116 (perhaps copied from Chaucer).</p>

  <p>643. <i>Can clepen Watte</i>, i.&nbsp;e. can call Walter (Wat) by his name;
  just as parrots are taught to say 'Poll.' In Political Songs, ed. Wright,
  p. 328, an ignorant priest is likened to a jay in a cage, to which is
  added: 'Go[o]d Engelish he speketh, ac [<i>but</i>] he wot nevere what';
  referring to the time when Anglo-French was the mother-tongue of many who
  became priests.</p>

  <p>644. 'But if any one could test him in any other point.'</p>

  <p>646. <i>Questio quid iuris.</i> 'This kind of question occurs
  frequently in Ralph de Hengham. After having stated a case, he adds,
  <i>quid juris</i>, and then proceeds to give an answer to it.'&mdash;T.
  It means&mdash;'the question is, what law (is there)?' i.&nbsp;e. what is the
  law on this point?</p>

  <p>647. <i>harlot</i>, fellow, usually one of low conduct; but originally
  merely a young person, without implication of reproach. See D. 1754.</p>

  <p>649. 'For a bribe of a quart of wine, he would allow a boon companion
  of his to lead a vicious life for a whole year, and entirely excuse him;
  moreover (on the other hand) he knew very well how to pluck a finch,'
  i.&nbsp;e. how to get all the feathers off any inexperienced person whom it
  was worth his while to cheat. Cf. 'a <i>pulled</i> hen' in l. 177. With
  reference to the treatment of the poor by usurers, &amp;c., we read in
  the Rom. of the Rose, l. 6820, that 'Withoute scalding they hem
  <i>pulle</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. pluck them. And see Troil. i. 210.</p>

  <p>654-7. 'He would teach his friend in such a case (i.&nbsp;e. if his friend
  led an evil life) to stand in no awe of the archdeacon's curse
  (excommunication), unless he supposed that his soul resided in his purse;
  for in his purse [not in his soul] he should be punished' (i.&nbsp;e. by
  paying a good round sum he could release himself from the archdeacon's
  curse). 'Your purse (said he) is the hell to which the archdeacon really
  refers when he threatens you.' See, particularly, Wyclif's Works, ed.
  Matthew, pp. 35, 62, 496.</p>

  <p>661. <i>assoilling</i>, absolution; from the vb. <i>assoil</i>.</p>

  <p>662. <i>war him of</i>, i.&nbsp;e. let him beware of; <i>war</i> is the
  pres. subj.</p>

  <p><i>significavit</i>, i.&nbsp;e. of a writ <i>de excommunicato capiendo</i>

  <p>663. <i>In daunger</i>, within his jurisdiction, within the reach or
  control of his office; the true sense of M.&nbsp;E. <i>daunger</i> is
  'control' or 'dominion.' Thus, in the Romaunt of the Rose, l. 1470, we
  find:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. whom Love had got into his power. So also in l. 1049 of the
  same.</p>

  <p>664. <i>yonge girles</i>, young people, of either sex. In the Coventry
  Mysteries, p. 181, there is mention of 'knave gerlys,' i.&nbsp;e. male
  children. And see <i>gerles</i> in the Gloss, to P. Plowman, and the note
  to the same, C. ii. 29.</p>

  <p>665. <i>and was al hir reed</i>, and was wholly their adviser.</p>

  <p>666, 667. <i>gerland.</i> A <i>garland</i> for an ale-stake was
  distinct from a <i>bush</i>. The latter was made of ivy-leaves; and every
  tavern had an ivy-bush hanging in front as its sign; hence the phrase,
  'Good wine needs no bush,' &amp;c. But the <i>garland</i>, often used in
  addition to the <i>bush</i>, was made of three equal hoops, at right
  angles to each other, and decorated with ribands. It was also called a
  <i>hoop</i>. The sompnour wore only a <i>single</i> hoop or circlet,
  adorned with large flowers (apparently roses), according to his picture
  in the Ellesmere MS. Emelye, in the Knightes Tale, is described as
  gathering white and red flowers to make 'a sotil gerland' for her head;
  A. 1054. 'Garlands of flowers were often worn on festivals, especially in
  ecclesiastical processions'; Rock, Church of our Fathers, ii. 72. Some
  garlands, worn on the head, were made of metal; see Riley, Memorials of
  London, p. 133.</p>

  <p>667. <i>ale-stake</i>, a support for a garland in front of an
  ale-house. For a picture of an ale-stake with a garland, see Hotten's
  Book of Signboards. The position of it was such that it did not stand
  upright, but projected <i>horizontally</i> from the side of a tavern at
  some height from the ground, as shewn in Larwood and Hotten's Book of
  Signboards. Hence the enactments made, that it should never extend above
  the roadway for more than seven feet; see Liber Albus, ed. H. T. Riley,
  1861, pp. 292, 389. Speght wrongly explained <i>ale-stake</i> as 'a
  Maypole,' and has misled many others, including Chatterton, who thus was
  led to write the absurd line&mdash;'<i>Around</i> the ale-stake minstrels
  sing the song'; Ælla, st. 30. '<i>At</i> the ale-stake' is correct; see
  C. 321.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Pardoner.</b></p>

  <p>669. As to the character of the Pardoner, see further in the
  Pardoner's Prologue, C. 329-462; P. Plowman, B. prol. 68-82; Heywood's
  Interlude of the <i>Four Ps</i>, which includes a shameless plagiarism
  from Chaucer's Pardoner's Prologue; and Sir David Lyndesay's Satire of
  the Three Estaits, l. 2037. Cf. note to C. 349. See also the Essay on
  Chaucer's Pardoner and the Pope's Pardoners, by Dr. J. Jusserand, in the
  Essays on Chaucer (Chaucer Society), p. 423; and the Chapter on <!-- Page
  55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>[55]</span>Pardoners in
  Jusserand's English Wayfaring Life. Jusserand shews that Chaucer has not
  in the least exaggerated; for exaggeration was not possible.</p>

  <p>670. <i>Of Rouncival.</i> Of course the Pardoner was an Englishman, so
  that he could hardly belong to Roncevaux, in Navarre. The reference is
  clearly to the hospital of the Blessed Mary of Rouncyvalle, in the parish
  of St. Martin in the Fields, at Charing (London), mentioned in Dugdale's
  Monasticon, ii. 443. Stow gives its date of foundation as the 15th year
  of Edward IV., but this was only a revival of it, after it had been
  suppressed by Henry V. It was a 'cell' to the Priory of Roncevaux in
  Navarre. See Todd's Illustrations of Gower, p. 263: and <i>Rouncival</i>
  in Nares. Cf. note to l. 172.</p>

  <p>672. <i>Com hider, love, to me.</i> 'This, I suppose, was the
  beginning or the burthen of some known song.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. It is
  quoted again in l. 763 of the poem called 'The Pearl,' in the
  form&mdash;'Come hyder to me, my lemman swete.' <i>hider</i>, hither.</p>

  <p>The rime of <i>tó me</i> with <i>Róme</i> should be particularly
  noted, as it enables even the reader who is least skilled in English
  phonology to perceive that <i>Ro-me</i> was really dissyllabic, and that
  the final <i>e</i> in such words was really pronounced. Similarly, in
  Octouian Imperator, ed. Weber, l. 1887, we find <i>seint Ja-mè</i>,
  riming with <i>frá me</i> (from me). Perhaps the most amusing example of
  editorial incompetence is seen in the frequent occurrence of the
  mysterious word <i>byme</i> in Pauli's edition of Gower; as, e.g. in bk.
  iii. vol. i. p. 370:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'So woll I nought, that any time</p>
      <p>Be lost, of that thou hast do <i>byme</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of course, <i>by me</i> should have been printed as two words, riming
  with <i>ti-mè</i>. This is what happens when grammatical facts are
  ignored. <i>Time</i> is dissyllabic, because it represents the A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>t&#x12B;ma</i>, which is never reduced to a monosyllable in A.&nbsp;S.</p>

  <p>673. <i>bar ... a stif burdoun</i>, sang the bass. See A. 4165, and N.

  <p>679. <i>colpons</i>, portions; the same word as mod. E.
  <i>coupon</i>.</p>

  <p>680. <i>for Iolitee</i>, for greater comfort. He thought it pleasanter
  to wear only a cap (l. 683). <i>wered</i>, wore; see l. 75. Cf. G. 571,

  <p>683. <i>Dischevele</i>, with his hair hanging loose.</p>

  <p>685. <i>vernicle</i>, a small copy of the 'vernicle' at Rome.
  <i>Vernicle</i> is 'a diminutive of <i>Veronike</i> (Veronica), a copy in
  miniature of the picture of Christ, which is supposed to have been
  miraculously imprinted upon a handkerchief preserved in the church of St.
  Peter at Rome.... It was usual for persons returning from pilgrimages to
  bring with them certain tokens of the several places which they had
  visited; and therefore the Pardoner, who is just arrived from Rome, is
  represented with a <i>vernicle sowed on his cappe</i>.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt.
  See the description of a pilgrim in Piers Plowman, ed. Skeat, B. v. 530,
  and the note. The legend was invented to explain the name. First the name
  of Bernice, taken from the Acts, was assigned to the woman who was cured
  by Christ of an issue of blood. Next, Bernice, otherwise Veronica, was
  (wrongly) explained as meaning <i>vera icon</i> (i.&nbsp;e. true likeness),
  which was assigned as the name of a handkerchief on which the features of
  Christ were miraculously impressed. Copies of this portrait were called
  <i>Veronicae</i> or <i>Veroniculae</i>, in English <i>vernicles</i>, and
  were obtainable by pilgrims to Rome. There was also a later St. Veronica,
  who died in 1497, after Chaucer's time, and whose day is Jan. 13.</p>

  <p>741, 742. This saying of Plato is taken from Boethius, De
  Consolatione, bk. iii. pr. 12, which Chaucer translates: 'Thou hast
  lerned by the sentence of Plato, that nedes the wordes moten be cosines
  to the thinges of which they speken'; see vol. ii. p. 90, l. 151. In Le
  Roman de la Rose, 7131, Jean de Meun says that Plato tells us, speech was
  given us to express our wishes and thoughts, and proceeds to argue that
  men ought to use coarse language. Chaucer was thinking of this singular
  argument. We also find in Le Roman (l. 15392) an exactly parallel
  passage, which means in English, 'the saying ought to resemble the deed;
  for the words, being neighbours to the things, ought to be cousins to
  their deeds.' In the original French, these passages stand
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>826. <i>St. Thomas a Waterings</i> was a place for watering horses, at
  a brook beside the second mile-stone on the road to St. Thomas's shrine,
  i.&nbsp;e. to Canterbury. It was a place anciently used for executions in the
  county of Surrey, as Tyburn was in that of Middlesex. See Nares, s. v.
  <i>Waterings</i>.</p>

  <p>828. <i>if yow leste</i>, if it may please you. The verb <i>listen</i>
  made <i>liste</i> in the past tense; but Chaucer changes the verb to the
  form <i>lesten</i>, pt. t. <i>leste</i>, probably for the sake of the
  rime. See ll. 750 and 102. In the Knightes Tale, A. 1052, <i>as hir
  liste</i> rimes with <i>upriste</i>.</p>

  <p>The true explanation is, that the A. S. <i>y</i> had the sound of mod.
  G. <i>ü</i>. In Mid. Eng., this was variably treated, usually becoming
  either <i>i</i> or <i>u</i>; so that, e.&nbsp;g., the A.&nbsp;S. <i>pyt</i> (a pit)
  became M.&nbsp;E. <i>pit</i> or <i>put</i>, the former of which has survived.
  But, in Kentish, the form was <i>pet</i>; and it is remarkable that
  Chaucer sometimes deliberately adopts Kentish forms, as here, for the
  sake of the rime. A striking example is seen in <i>fulfelle</i> for
  <i>fulfille</i>, in Troil. iii. 510, to rime with <i>telle</i>. He
  usually has <i>fulfille</i>, as below, in A. 1318, 2478.</p>

  <p>829. <i>Ye woot</i>, ye know. Really false grammar, as the pl. of
  <i>woot</i> (originally a past tense) is properly <i>witen</i>, just as
  the pl. of <i>rood</i> is <i>riden</i> in l. 825. As <i>woot</i> was used
  as a present tense, its original form was forgotten. 'Ye know your
  agreement, and I recall it to your memory.' See l. 33.</p>

  <p>830. 'If even-song and matins agree'; i.&nbsp;e. if you still say now what
  you said last night.</p>

  <p>832. 'As ever may I be able to drink'; i.&nbsp;e. As surely as I ever hope
  to be able, &amp;c. Cf. B. 4490, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>833. <i>be</i>, may be (subjunctive mood).</p>

  <p>835. <i>draweth cut</i>, draw lots; see C. 793-804. The Gloss. to
  Allan Ramsay's poems, ed. 1721, has&mdash;'<i>cutts</i>, lots. These cuts
  are usually made of straws unequally cut, which one hides between his
  finger and thumb, whilst another draws his fate'; but the verb <i>to
  cut</i> is unallied. See Brand, Pop. Antiq., iii. 337. The one who drew
  the shortest (or else the longest) straw was the one who drew the lot.
  Cf. '<i>Sors</i>, a kut, or a lotte'; Reliquiae Antiquae, i. 7. 'After
  supper, we drew <i>cuttes</i> for a score of apricoks, the longest
  <i>cut</i> stil to draw an apricoke'; Marston, Induction to <i>The
  Malcontent</i>.</p>

  <p><i>ferrer twinne</i>, depart further. Here <i>ferrer</i> is the comp.
  of <i>fer</i>, far. <i>Twinnen</i> is to separate, part in twain; hence,
  to depart.</p>

  <p>844. <i>sort</i>, lot, destiny; O. F. <i>sort</i>; cf. E.
  <i>sort</i>.</p>

  <p>847. <i>as was resoun</i>, as was reasonable or right.</p>

  <p>848. <i>forward</i>, agreement, as in l. 33. <i>compositioun</i> has
  almost exactly the same sense, but is of French origin.</p>

  <p>854. <i>What</i>; used interjectionally, like the modern E. 'why!'</p>

  <p><i>a</i>, in. Here <i>a</i> is for <i>an</i>, a form of <i>on</i>; the

  <p>For general remarks on this tale, see vol. iii. p. 389.</p>

  <p>It is only possible to give here a mere general idea of the way in
  which the Knightes Tale is related to the Teseide of Boccaccio. The
  following table gives a sketch of it, but includes many lines wherein
  Chaucer is quite original. The references to the Knightes Tale are to the
  lines of group A (as in the text); those to the Teseide are to the books

  <p>The MSS. quote a line and a half from Statius, Thebaid, xii. 519, 520,
  because Chaucer is referring to that passage in his introductory lines to
  this tale; see particularly ll. 866, 869, 870.</p>

  <p>There is yet another reason for quoting this scrap of Latin, viz. that
  it is also quoted in the Poem of Anelida and Arcite, at l. 22, where the
  'Story' of that poem begins; and ll. 22-25 of Anelida give a fairly close
  translation of it. From this and other indications, it appears that
  Chaucer first of all imitated Boccaccio's Teseide (more or less closely)
  in the poem which he himself calls 'Palamon and Arcite,' of which but
  scanty traces exist in the original form; and this poem was in 7-line
  stanzas. He afterwards recast the whole, at the same time changing the
  metre; and the result was the Knightes Tale, as we here have it. Thus the
  Knightes Tale is not derived <i>immediately</i> from Boccaccio or from
  Statius, but <i>through the medium</i> of an older poem <!-- Page 61
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[61]</span>of Chaucer's own
  composition. Fragments of the same poem were used by the author in other
  compositions; and the result is, that the Teseide of Boccaccio is the
  source of (1) sixteen stanzas in the Parliament of Foules; (2) of part of
  the first ten stanzas in Anelida; (3) of three stanzas near the end of
  Troilus (Tes. xi. 1-3); as well as of the original Palamon and Arcite and
  of the Knightes Tale.</p>

  <p>Hence it is that ll. 859-874 and ll. 964-981 should be compared with
  Chaucer's Anelida, ll. 22-46, as printed in vol. i. p. 366. Lines 882 and
  972 are borrowed from that poem with but slight alteration.</p>

  <p>859. The lines from Statius, Theb. xii. 519-22, to which reference is
  made in the heading, relate to the return of Theseus to Athens after his
  conquest of Hippolyta, and are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Iamque domos patrias, Scythicae post aspera gentis</p>
      <p>Proelia, laurigero subeuntem Thesea curru</p>

      <p>Clamor, et emeritis hilaris tuba nuntiat armis.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>860. <i>Theseus</i>, the great legendary hero of Attica, is the
  subject of Boccaccio's poem named after him the Teseide. He is also the
  hero of the Legend of Ariadne, as told in Chaucer's Legend of Good Women.
  After deserting Ariadne, he succeeded his father Aegeus as king of
  Athens, and conducted an expedition against the Amazons, from which he
  returned in triumph, having carried off their queen Antiope, here named
  Hippolyta.</p>

  <p>861. <i>governour.</i> It should be observed that Chaucer continually
  accents words of Anglo-French origin in the original manner, viz. on the
  <i>last</i> or on the <i>penultimate</i> syllable. Thus we have here
  <i>governóur</i> and <i>conqueróur</i>; in l. 865, <i>chivalrý-e</i>; in
  l. 869, <i>contrée</i>; in l. 876, <i>manére</i>, &amp;c. The most
  remarkable examples are when the words end in <i><span
  class="nw">-oun</span></i> (ll. 893, 935).</p>

  <p>864. <i>cóntree</i> is here accented on the <i>first</i> syllable; in
  l. 869, on the <i>last</i>. This is a good example of the unsettled state
  of the accents of such words in Chaucer's time, which afforded him an
  opportunity of licence, which he freely uses. In fact, <i>cóntree</i>
  shows the <i>English</i>, and <i>contrée</i>, the <i>French</i>
  accent.</p>

  <p>865. <i>chivalrye</i>, knightly exploits. In l. 878, <i>chivalrye</i>
  means 'knights'; mod. E. <i>chivalry</i>. So also in l. 982.</p>

  <p>866. <i>regne of Femenye</i>, the kingdom (Lat. <i>regnum</i>) of the
  Amazons. <i>Femenye</i> is from Lat. <i>femina</i>, a woman. Cf. Statius,
  Theb. xii. 578. 'Amazonia, womens land, is a Country, parte in Asia and
  parte in Europa, and is nigh Albania; and hath that name of Amazonia of
  women that were the wives of the men that were called Goths, the which
  men went out of the nether Scithia, as Isidore seith, li.
  9.'&mdash;Batman upon Bartholomè, lib. xv. c. 12. Cf. Higden's
  Polychronicon, lib. i. cap. xviii; and Gower, Conf. Amant., ii.
  73:&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>[62]</span></p>

  <p>867. <i>Scithea</i>, Scythia. Cf. <i>Scythicae</i> in the quotation
  from Statius in note to l. 859.</p>

  <p>868. <i>Ipolita</i>, Shakespeare's <i>Hippolyta</i>, in Mids. Night's
  Dream. The name is in Statius, Theb. xii. 534, spelt
  <i>Hippolyte</i>.</p>

  <p>880. In this line, <i>Athenes</i> seems to mean 'Athenians,' though
  elsewhere it means 'Athens.' <i>Athénès</i> is trisyllabic.</p>

  <p>884. <i>tempest.</i> As there is no mention of a tempest in Boccaccio,
  Tyrwhitt proposed to alter the reading to <i>temple</i>, as there is some
  mention of Theseus offering in the temple of Pallas. But it is very
  unlikely that this would be alluded to by the mere word <i>temple</i>;
  and we must accept the reading <i>tempest</i>, as in all the seven MSS.
  and in the old editions.</p>

  <p>I think the solution is to be found by referring to Statius. Chaucer
  seems to have remembered that a tempest is there described (Theb. xii.
  650-5), but to have forgotten that it is merely introduced by way of
  <i>simile</i>. In fact, when Theseus determines to attack Creon (see l.
  960), the advance of his host is likened by Statius to the effect of a
  tempest. The lines are:&mdash;</p>

  corresponding to the sense 'in rotation, in succession,' given in the New

  out by Dr. Kölbing in Engl. Studien, ii. 531. He instanced a similar use

  <p>928. <i>Clemence</i>, Clemency, Pity. Suggested by 'il tempio ... di
  Clemenza,' Tes. ii. 17; which again is from 'mitis posuit Clementia
  sedem,' Theb. xii. 482.</p>

  <p>932. <i>Capaneus</i>, one of the seven heroes who besieged Thebes:
  struck dead by lightning as he was scaling the walls of the city, because
  he had defied Zeus; Theb. x. 927. See note to l. 912, above.</p>

  <p>937. The celebrated siege of 'The Seven against Thebes'; Capaneus
  being one of the seven kings.</p>

  <p>941. <i>for despyt</i>, out of vexation; mod. E. 'for spite.'</p>

  <p>942. <i>To do the dede bodyes vileinye</i>, to treat the dead bodies
  shamefully.</p>

  <p>948. <i>withouten more respyt</i>, without longer delay.</p>

  <p>949. <i>They fillen gruf</i>, they fell flat with the face to the
  ground. In M. E. we find the phrase <i>to fall grovelinges</i> or <i>to
  fall groveling</i>. See <i>Gruflynge</i> and <i>Ogrufe</i> in the
  Catholicon Anglicum, and the editor's notes, pp. 166, 259.</p>

  <p>954. <i>Himthoughte</i>, it seemed to him; cf. <i>methinks</i>, it
  seems to me. In M. E. the verbs <i>like</i>, <i>list</i>, <i>seem</i>,
  <i>rue</i> (pity), are used impersonally, and take the dative case of the
  pronoun. Cf. the modern expression 'if you please' = if it be pleasing to
  you.</p>

  <p>955. <i>mat</i>, dejected. 'Ententyfly, not feynt, wery ne
  <i>mate</i>.'&mdash;Hardyng, p. 129.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>960. <i>ferforthly</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>far-forth-like</i>, to such an
  extent.</p>

  <p>965. <i>abood</i>, delay, awaiting, abiding.</p>

  <p>966. <i>His baner he desplayeth</i>, i.&nbsp;e. he summons his troops to
  assemble for military service.</p>

  <p>968. <i>No neer</i>, no nearer. Accent <i>Athén-es</i> on the second
  syllable; but in l. 973 it is accented on the <i>first</i>.</p>

  <p>970. <i>lay</i>, lodged for the night.</p>

  <p>975. <i>státue</i>, the image, as depicted on the banner.</p>

  <p>977. <i>feeldes</i>, field, is an heraldic term for the ground upon
  which the various charges, as they are called, are emblazoned. Some of
  this <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>[64]</span>description was suggested by the Thebais,
  lib. xii. 665, &amp;c.; but the resemblance is very slight.</p>

  <p>978. <i>penoun</i>, pennon. <i>y-bete</i>, beaten; the gold being
  hammered out into a thin foil in the shape of the Minotaur; see Marco
  Polo, ed. Yule, i. 344. But, in the Thebais, the Minotaur is upon
  Theseus' <i>shield</i>.</p>

  <p>988. <i>In pleyn bataille</i>, in open or fair fight.</p>

  <p>993. <i>obséquies</i> (Elles., &amp;c.); <i>exéquies</i> (Harl.);
  accented on the <i>second</i> syllable.</p>

  <p>1004. <i>as him leste</i>, as it pleased him.</p>

  <p>1005. <i>tas</i>, heap, collection. Some MSS. read <i>cas</i>
  (<i>caas</i>), which might = downfall, ruin, Lat. <i>casus</i>; but, as
  <i>c</i> and <i>t</i> are constantly confused, this reading is really due
  to a mere blunder. Gower speaks of gathering 'a <i>tasse</i>' of sticks;
  Conf. Amant. bk. v. ed. Pauli, ii. 293. Palsgrave has&mdash;'On a heape,
  <i>en vng tas</i>'; p. 840. Hexham's Dutch Dict. (1658) has&mdash;'<i>een
  Tas</i>, a Shock, a Pile, or a Heape.' Chaucer found the word in Le Roman
  de la Rose, 14870: 'ung <i>tas</i> de paille,' a heap of straw.</p>

  <p>1006. <i>harneys.</i> 'And <i>arma</i> be not taken onely for the
  instruments of al maner of crafts, but also for <i>harneys</i> and
  weapon; also standards and banners, and sometimes
  battels.'&mdash;Bossewell's Armorie, p. 1, ed. 1597. Cf. l. 1613.</p>

  <p>1010. <i>Thurgh-girt</i>, pierced through. This line is taken from
  Troilus, iv. 627: 'Thourgh-girt with many a wyd and blody wounde.'</p>

  <p>1011. <i>liggyng by and by</i>, lying near together, as in A. 4143;
  the usual old sense being 'in succession,' or 'in order'; see examples in
  the New Eng. Dict., p. 1233, col. 3. In later English, <i>by and by</i>
  signifies presently, immediately, as 'the end is not <i>by and
  by</i>.'</p>

  <p>1012. <i>in oon armes</i>, in one (kind of) arms or armour, shewing
  that they belonged to the same house. Chaucer adapts ancient history to
  medieval time throughout his works.</p>

  <p>1015. <i>Nat fully quike</i>, not wholly alive.</p>

  <p>1016. <i>by hir cote-armures</i>, by their coat-armour, by the devices
  on the vest worn above the armour covering the breast. The
  <i>cote-armure</i>, as explained in my note to Barbour's Bruce, xiii.
  183, was 'of no use as a defence, being made of a flimsy material; but
  was worn over the true armour of defence, and charged with armorial
  bearings'; see Ho. Fame, 1326. Cf. l. 1012. <i>by hir gere</i>, by their
  <i>gear</i>, i.&nbsp;e. equipments.</p>

  <p>1018. <i>they.</i> Tyrwhitt (who relied too much on the black-letter
  editions) reads <i>tho</i>, those; but the seven best MSS. have
  <i>they</i>.</p>

  <p>1023. <i>Tathenes</i>, to Athens (Harl. MS., which reads <i>for to</i>
  for <i>to</i>). Cf. <i>tallegge</i>, l. 3000 (foot-note).</p>

  <p>1024. <i>he nolde no raunsoun</i>, he would accept of no ransom.</p>

  <p>1029. <i>Terme of his lyf</i>, the remainder of his life. Cf. 'The end
  and <i>term</i> of natural philosophy.'&mdash;Bacon's Advancement of
  Learning, Bk. ii. p. 129, ed. Aldis Wright.</p>

  <p>1035. Cf. Leg. of Good Women, 2425, 2426.</p>

  <p>1038. <i>stroof hir hewe</i>, strove her hue; i.&nbsp;e. her complexion
  contested the superiority with the rose's colour. <!-- Page 65 --><span

  <p>1039. <i>I noot</i>, I know not; <i>noot</i> = <i>ne woot</i>.</p>

  <p>1047. <i>May.</i> 'Against Maie, every parishe, towne, and village,
  assembled themselves together, bothe men, women, and children, olde and
  yonge, even all indifferently, and either going all together or devidyng
  themselves into companies, they goe, some to the woodes and groves, some
  to the hills and mountaines, some to one place, some to another, where
  they spend all the night in pastimes; in the morninge they return,

  elsewhere; see l. 1743, E. 56, F. 889.</p>

  <p>1100. Cf. 'That cause is of my torment and my sorwe': Troil. v.

  <p>1101. Cf. 'But whether goddesse or womman, y-wis, She be, I noot';
  Troil. i. 425.</p>

  <p><i>wher</i>, a very common form for <i>whether</i>.</p>

  <p>1105. <i>Yow</i> (used reflexively), yourself.</p>

  <p>1106. <i>wrecche</i>, wretched, is a word of two syllables, like

  addition.</p>

  <p>1108. <i>shapen</i>, shaped, determined. '<i>Shapes</i> our
  ends.'&mdash;Shakespeare, Hamlet, v. 2. 10. Cf. l. 1225.</p>

  <p>1120. 'And except I have her pity and her favour.'</p>

  <p>1121. <i>atte leeste weye</i>, at the least. Cf. <i>leastwise</i> =
  <i>at the leastwise</i>: '<i>at leastwise</i>'; Bacon's Advancement of
  Learning, ed. Wright, p. 146, l. 23. See English Bible (Preface of 'The
  Translators to the Reader').</p>

  <p>1122. 'I am not but (no better than) dead, there is no more to say.'
  Chaucer uses <i>ne</i>&mdash;<i>but</i> much in the same way as the Fr.
  <i>ne&mdash;que</i>. Cf. North English 'I'm <i>nobbut</i> clemmed' = I am
  almost dead of hunger.</p>

  <p>1126. <i>by my fey</i>, by my faith, in good faith.</p>

  <p>1127. <i>me list ful yvele pleye</i>, it pleaseth me very badly to
  play.</p>

  <p>1128. This debate is an imitation of the longer debate (in the
  Teseide), where Palamon and Arcite meet in the grove; cf. l. 1580
  below.</p>

  <p>1129. <i>It nere</i> = <i>it were not</i>, it would not be.</p>

  <p>1132. 'It was a common practice in the middle ages for persons to take
  formal oaths of fraternity and friendship; and a breach of the oath was
  considered something worse than perjury. This incident enters into the
  plots of some of the medieval romances. A curious example will be found
  in the Romance of Athelston; Reliquiæ Antiquæ, ii. 85.'&mdash;Wright. A
  note in Bell's Chaucer reminds us that instances occur also in the old
  heroic times; as in the cases of Theseus and Peirithous, Achilles and
  Patroclus, Pylades and Orestes, Nysus and Euryalus. See <i>Sworn
  Brothers</i> in Nares' Glossary; Rom. of the Rose, 2884.</p>

  <p>1133. 'That never, even though it cost us a miserable death, a death
  by torture.' So in Troilus, i. 674: 'That certayn, for to deyen in the
  peyne.' Also in the E. version of The Romaunt of the Rose, 3326.</p>

  <p>1134. 'Till that death shall part us two.' Cf. the ingenious
  alteration in the Marriage Service, where the phrase 'till death us
  depart' was altered into 'do part' in 1661.</p>

  <p>1136. <i>cas</i>, case. It properly means event, hap. See l. 1074.</p>

  <p><i>my leve brother</i>, my dear brother.</p>

  <p>1141. <i>out of doute</i>, without doubt, doubtless.</p>

  <p>1147. <i>to my counseil</i>, to my adviser. See l. 1161.</p>

  <p>1151. <i>I dar wel seyn</i>, I dare maintain. <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[67]</span></p>

  <p>1153. <i>Thou shalt be.</i> Chaucer occasionally uses <i>shall</i> in
  the sense of <i>owe</i>, so that the true sense of <i>I shall</i> is <i>I
  owe</i> (Lat. <i>debeo</i>); it expresses a strong obligation. So here it
  is not so much the sign of a future tense as a separate verb, and the
  sense is 'Thou art sure to be false sooner than I am.'</p>

  <p>1155. <i>par amour</i>, with love, in the way of love. To love <i>par
  amour</i> is an old phrase for to love excessively. Cf. Bruce, xiii. 485;
  and see A. 2112, below; Troil. v. 158, 332.</p>

  <p>1158. <i>affeccioun of holinesse</i>, a sacred affection, or
  aspiration after.</p>

  <p>1162. <i>I pose</i>, I put the case, I will suppose.</p>

  <p>1163. 'Knowest thou not well the old writer's saying?' The <i>olde
  clerk</i> is Boethius, from whose book, De Consolatione Philosophiae,
  Chaucer has borrowed largely in many places. The passage alluded to is in
  lib. iii. met. 12:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Quis legem det amantibus?</p>
      <p>Maior lex amor est sibi.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Chaucer's translation (vol. ii. p. 92, l. 37) has&mdash;'But what is
  he that may yive a lawe to loveres? Love is a gretter lawe ... than any
  lawe that men may yeven.' And see Troil. iv. 618.</p>

  <p>1167. <i>and swich decree</i>, and (all) such ordinances.</p>

  <p>1168. <i>in ech degree</i>, in every rank of life.</p>

  <p>1172. <i>And eek it is</i>, &amp;c., 'and moreover it is not likely
  that ever in all thy life thou wilt stand in her favour.'</p>

  <p>1177. This fable, in this particular form, is not in any of the usual
  collections; but it is, practically, the same as that called 'The Lion,
  the Tiger, and the Fox' in Croxall's Æsop. Sometimes it is 'the Lion, the
  Bear, and the Fox'; the Fox subtracts the prey for which the others
  fight. It is no. 247 in Halm's edition of the 'Fabulae Æsopicae,' Lips.,
  Teubner, 1852, with the moral:&mdash;<span title="ho muthos dêloi, hoti allôn kopiôntôn alloi kerdainousin." class="grk"

  In La Fontaine's Fables, it appears as Les Voleurs et l'Âne. Thynne

  <p>1196. From the Legend of Good Women, 2282.</p>

  <p>1200. <i>in helle.</i> An allusion to Theseus accompanying Pirithous
  in his expedition to carry off Proserpina, daughter of Aidoneus, king of
  the Molossians, when both were taken prisoner, and Pirithous torn in
  pieces by the dog Cerberus. At least, such is the story in Plutarch; see
  Shakespeare's Plutarch, ed. Skeat, p. 289. Chaucer found the mention of
  Pirithous' visit to Athens in Boccaccio's Teseide, iii. 47-51. The rest
  he found in Le Roman de la Rose, 8186&mdash;</p>

  <p>1372. 'In his changing mood, for all the world, he conducted himself
  not merely like one suffering from the lover's disease of Eros, but
  rather (his disease was) like <i>mania</i> engendered of melancholy
  humour.' This is one of the numerous allusions to the four humours, viz.
  the choleric, phlegmatic, sanguine, and melancholic. An excess of the
  latter was supposed to produce 'melancholy madness.' <i>gere</i>, flighty
  manner, changeableness; 'Siche <i>wilde gerys</i> hade he mo'; Thornton
  Romances, Sir Percival, l. 1353. See note to l. 1536.</p>

  <p>1376. <i>in his celle fantastyk.</i> Tyrwhitt reads <i>Beforne his hed
  in his celle fantastike</i>. Elles. has <i>Biforn his owene celle
  fantastik</i>. 'The division of the brain into cells, according to the
  different sensitive faculties, is very ancient, and is found depicted in
  medieval manuscripts. The <i>fantastic cell</i> (<i>fantasia</i>) was in
  front of the head.'&mdash;Wright. Hence <i>Biforen</i> means 'in the
  front part of his head.'</p>

  <p>'Madnesse is infection of the formost cel of the head, with priuation
  of imagination, lyke as melancholye is the infection of the middle cell
  of the head, with priuation of reason, as Constant. saith in <i>libro de
  Melancolia</i>. Melancolia (saith he) is an infection that hath mastry of
  the soule, the which commeth of dread and of sorrow. And these passions
  be diuerse after the diuersity of the hurt of their workings; for by
  madnesse that is called <i>Mania</i>, principally the imagination is
  hurt; and in the other reson is hurted.'&mdash;Batman upon Bartholomè,
  lib. vii. c. 6. Vincent of Beauvais, bk. xxviii. c. 41, cites a similar
  statement from the <i>Liber de Anatomia</i>, which
  begins:&mdash;'Cerebrum itaque tribus cellulis est distinctum. Duae
  namque meringes cerebri faciunt tres plicaturas inter se denexas, in
  quibus tres sunt cellulae: phantastica scilicet ab anteriori parte
  capitis, in qua sedem habet imaginatio.' So in Batman upon Bartholomè,
  lib. v. c. 3:&mdash;'The Braine ... is diuided in three celles or
  dens.... In the formost cell ... imagination is conformed and made; in
  the middle, reason; in the hindermost, recordation and minde' [memory].

  <p>1471. <i>clarree.</i> 'The French term <i>claré</i> seems simply to
  have denoted a clear transparent wine, but in its most usual sense a
  compounded drink of wine with honey and spices, so delicious as to be
  comparable to the nectar of the gods. In Sloane MS. 2584, f. 173, the
  following directions are found for making <i>clarré</i>:&mdash;"Take a

  20; iv. 4. 26, 5. 24; v. 2. 15; vi. 7. 41. See <i>deraisnier</i> in

  <i>foinen</i> means to thrust or push, as in attack, not as in defence.

  emphasis; the sense is:&mdash;'Who can be a (complete) fool, unless he is
  in love?' The old printed editions have the same reading. The Harl. MS.
  alone has <i>if that</i> for <i>but-if</i>, giving the sense: 'Who can be
  fool, if he is in love?' As this is absurd, Mr. Wright <i>silently</i>
  inserted <i>not</i> after <i>may</i>, and is followed by Bell and Morris;
  but the latter prints <i>not</i> in italics. Observe that the line is

  <p>1814. <i>a servant</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a lover. This sense of <i>servant</i>,
  as a term of gallantry, is common in our dramatists.</p>

  <p>1815, 1818. Cf. the Teseide, v. 92.</p>

  <p>1837. <i>looth or leef</i>, displeasing or pleasing.</p>

  <p>1838. <i>pypen in an ivy leef</i> is an expression like 'blow the
  buck's-horn' in A. 3387, meaning to console oneself with any frivolous
  <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>[75]</span>employment; it occurs again in Troilus, v.
  1433. Cf. the expression 'to go and whistle.' Cf. 'farwel the gardiner;
  he may pipe with an yue-leafe; his fruite is failed'; Test. of Love, bk.
  iii; ed. 1561, fol. 316. Boys still blow against a leaf, and produce a
  squeak. Lydgate uses similar expressions:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Again, in Hazlitt's Proverbs, we find 'To go blow one's flute,' which
  is taken from an old proverb. In Vox Populi Vox Dei (circa 1547), pr. in
  Hazlitt's Popular Poetry, iii. 284, are the lines:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1850. <i>fer ne ner</i>, farther nor nearer, neither more nor less.
  'After some little trouble, I have arrived at the conclusion that Chaucer
  has given us sufficient <i>data</i> for ascertaining both the days of the
  month and of the week of many of the principal events of the "Knightes
  Tale." The following scheme will explain many things hitherto
  unnoticed.</p>

  <p>'On Friday, May 4, before 1 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>, Palamon
  breaks out of prison. For (l. 1463) it was during the "third night of
  May, but (l. 1467) a little <i>after</i> midnight." That it was Friday is
  evident also, from observing that Palamon hides himself at day's
  approach, whilst Arcite rises "for to doon his observance to May,
  remembring on the <i>poynt of his desyr</i>." To do this best, he would
  go into the fields at <i>sunrise</i> (l. 1491), during the hour dedicated
  to <i>Venus</i>, i.&nbsp;e. during the hour after sunrise <i>on a Friday</i>.
  If however this seem for a moment doubtful, all doubt is removed by the
  following lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Right as the <i>Friday</i>, soothly for to telle,</p>
      <p>Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,</p>
      <p>Right so gan gery <i>Venus</i> overcaste</p>
      <p>The hertes of hir folk; right as <i>hir day</i></p>
      <p>Is gerful, right so chaungeth she array.</p>
      <p>Selde is the <i>Friday</i> al the wyke ylyke."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>'All this is very little to the point unless we suppose Friday to be
  the day. Or, if the reader have <i>still</i> any doubt about this, let
  him observe the curious accumulation of evidence which is to follow.</p>

  <p>'Palamon and Arcite meet, and a duel is arranged for an early hour on
  the <i>day following</i>. That is, they meet on Saturday, May 5. But, as
  Saturday is presided over by the inauspicious planet Saturn, it is no
  wonder that they are both unfortunate enough to have their duel <!-- Page
  76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>[76]</span>interrupted
  by Theseus, and to find themselves threatened with death. Still, at the
  intercession of the queen and Emily, a day of assembly for a tournament
  is fixed for "<i>this day fifty wykes</i>" (l. 1850). Now we must
  understand "fifty wykes" to be a poetical expression for <i>a year</i>.
  This is not mere supposition, however, but a <i>certainty</i>; because
  the appointed day was in the month of <i>May</i>, whereas fifty weeks and
  no more would land us in <i>April</i>. Then "this day fyfty wekes" means
  "this day year," viz. on May 5. [In fact, Boccaccio has 'un anno intero';
  Tes. v. 98.]</p>

  <p>'Now, in the year following (supposed not a leap-year), the 5th of May
  would be <i>Sunday</i>. But this we are expressly told in l. 2188. It
  must be noted, however, that this is not the day of the
  <i>tournament</i><a name="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>, but
  of the <i>muster</i> for it, as may be gleaned from ll. 1850-1854 and
  2096. The eleventh hour "inequal" of Sunday night, or the second hour
  before sunrise of Monday, is dedicated to <i>Venus</i>, as explained by
  Tyrwhitt (l. 2217); and therefore Palamon then goes to the temple of
  Venus. The next hour is dedicated to Mercury. The third hour, the first
  after sunrise on Monday, is dedicated to Luna or Diana, and during this
  Emily goes to Diana's temple. The fourth after sunrise is dedicated to
  Mars, and therefore Arcite then goes to the temple of Mars. But the rest
  of the day is spent merely in jousting and preparations&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Al that <i>Monday</i> justen they and daunce." (l. 2486.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The tournament therefore takes place on Tuesday, May 7, on the day of
  the week presided over by <i>Mars</i>, as was very fitting; and this
  perhaps helps to explain Saturn's exclamation in l. 2669, "Mars hath his
  wille."'&mdash;Walter W. Skeat, in Notes and Queries, Fourth Series, ii.
  2, 3; Sept. 12, 1868 (since slightly corrected).</p>

  <p>To this was added the observation, that May 5 was on a Saturday in
  1386, and on a Sunday in 1387. Ten Brink (Studien, p. 189) thinks it is
  of no value; but the coincidence is curious.</p>

  <p>1866. 'Except that one of you shall be either slain or taken
  prisoner'; i.&nbsp;e. one of you must be fairly conquered.</p>

  <p>1884. <i>listes</i>, lists. 'The lists for the tilts and tournaments
  resembled those, I doubt not, appointed for the ordeal combats, which,
  according to the rules established by Thomas, duke of Gloucester, uncle
  to Richard II., were as follows. The king shall find the field to fight
  in, and the lists shall be made and devised by the constable; and it is
  to be observed, that the list must be 60 paces long and 40 paces broad,
  set up in good order, and the ground within hard, stable, and level,
  without any great stones or other impediments; also, that the lists must
  be made <i>with one door to the east, and another to the west</i> [see
  <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>[77]</span>ll.
  1893, 4]; and strongly barred about with good bars 7 feet high or more,
  so that a horse may not be able to leap over them.'&mdash;Strutt, Sports
  and Pastimes; bk. iii. c. 1. § 23.</p>

  <p>1889. The various parts of this round theatre are subsequently
  described. On the North was the turret of Diana, with an oratory; on the
  East the gate of Venus, with altar and oratory above; on the West the
  gate of Mars, similarly provided.</p>

  <p>1890. <i>Ful of degrees</i>, full of steps (placed one above another,
  as in an amphitheatre). 'But now they have gone a nearer way to the wood,
  for with wooden galleries in the church that they have, and <i>stairy
  degrees of seats</i> in them, they make as much room to sit and hear, as
  a new west end would have done.'&mdash;Nash's Red Herring, p. 21. See
  Shakespeare, Julius Cæsar, ii. 126, and also 2 Kings xx. 9. Cf. 'While
  she stey up from <i>gre</i> to <i>gre</i>.'&mdash;Lives of Saints, Roxb.
  Club, p. 59. Lines 1187-1894 are more or less imitated from the Teseide,
  vii. 108-110.</p>

  <p>1910. Coral is a curious material to use for such a purpose; but we
  find posts of coral and a palace chiefly formed of coral and metal in Guy
  of Warwick, ed. Zupitza, 11399-11401.</p>

  <p>1913. <i>don wroght</i>, caused (to be) made; observe this idiom. Cf.
  <i>don yow kept</i>, E. 1098; <i>han doon fraught</i>, B. 171; <i>haf
  gert saltit</i>, Bruce, xviii. 168.</p>

  <p>1918-32. See the analysis of this passage in vol. iii. p. 390.</p>

  <p>1919. <i>on the wal</i>, viz. on the walls <i>within</i> the oratory.
  The description is loosely imitated from Boccaccio's Teseide, vii. 55-59.
  It is remarkable that there is a much closer imitation of the same
  passage in Chaucer's Parl. of Foules, ll. 183-294. Thus at l. 246 of that
  poem we find:&mdash;</p>

  <p>There is yet another description of the temple of Venus in the House
  of Fame, 119-139, where we have the very line 'Naked fletinge in a see'
  (cf. l. 1956 below), and a mention of the 'rose garlond' (cf. l. 1961),
  and of 'Hir dowves and daun Cupido' (cf. ll. 1962-3).</p>

  <p>1929. <i>golde</i>, a marigold; <i>Calendula</i>. '<i>Goolde</i>,

  Parv. The corn-marigold in the North is called <i>goulans</i>,
  <i>guilde</i>, or <i>goles</i>, and in the South, <i>golds</i> (Way).

  <p>Yellow is the colour of jealousy; see <i>Yellowness</i> in Nares. In
  the Rom. de la Rose, 22037, Jealousy is described as wearing a 'chapel de
  <i>soussie</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. a chaplet of marigolds.</p>

  <p>1936. <i>Citheroun</i> = Cithaeron, sacred to Venus; as said in the
  Rom. de la Rose, 15865, q.v.</p>

  <p>1940. In the Romaunt of the Rose, <i>Idleness</i> is the <i>porter</i>
  of the garden in which the rose (Beauty) is kept. In the Parl. of Foules,
  261, the porter's name is <i>Richesse</i>. Cf. ll. 2, 3 of the Second
  Nonnes Tale (G. 2, 3).</p>

  <p>1941. <i>of yore agon</i>, of years gone by. Cf. Ovid, Met. iii.
  407.</p>

  <p>1953-4. Imitated from Le Roman de la Rose, 16891-2.</p>

  <p>1955. The description of Venus here given has some resemblance to that
  given in cap. v (De Venere) of Albrici Philosophi De Deorum Imaginibus
  Libellus, in an edition of the Mythographi Latini, Amsterdam, 1681, vol.
  ii. p. 304. I transcribe as much as is material. 'Pingebatur Venus
  pulcherrima puella, nuda, et in mari natans; et in manu sua dextra
  concham marinam tenens atque gestans; rosisque candidis et rubris sertum
  gerebat in capite ornatum, et columbis circa se volando, comitabatur....
  Hinc et Cupido filius suus alatus et caecus assistebat, qui sagitta et
  arcu, quos tenebat, Apollinem sagittabat.' It is clear that Chaucer had
  consulted some such description as this; see further in the note to l.
  2041.</p>

  <p>1958. Cf. 'wawes ... clere as glas'; Boeth. bk. i. met. 7. 4.</p>

  <p>1971. <i>estres</i>, the inner parts of a building; as also in A. 4295
  and Leg. of Good Women, 1715. 'To spere the <i>estyrs</i> of Rome'; Le
  Bone Florence, 293; in Ritson, Met. Rom. iii. 13. See also Cursor Mundi,

  <p>The word <i>armipotent</i> is borrowed from Boccaccio's
  <i>armipotente</i>, in the Teseide, vii. 32. Other similar borrowings
  occur hereabouts, too numerous for mention. Note that this description of
  the temple of Mars once belonged to the end of the poem of Anelida, which
  see.</p>

  <p>Let the reader take particular notice that the temple here described
  (ll. 1982-1994) is merely a <i>painted</i> temple, depicted on one of the
  walls <i>inside</i> the oratory of Mars. The walls of the other temples
  had paintings similar to those inside the temple of which the outside is
  here depicted. Chaucer describes the painted temple as if it were real,
  which is somewhat confusing. Inconsistent additions were made in
  revision.</p>

  <p>1984. <i>streit</i>, narrow; 'la stretta entrata'; Tes. vii. 32.</p>

  <p>1985. <i>vese</i> is glossed <i>impetus</i> in the Ellesmere MS., and
  means 'rush' or 'hurrying blast.' It is allied to M.E. <i>fesen</i>, to
  drive, which is Shakespeare's <i>pheeze</i>. Copied from 'salit Impetus
  amens E foribus'; Theb. vii. 47, 48.</p>

  <p>1986. <i>rese</i> = to shake, quake. 'Þe eorðe gon <i>to-rusien</i>,'
  'the earth gan to shake.'&mdash;La&#x21D;amon, l. 15946. <i>To resye</i>,
  to shake, occurs in Ayenbite of Inwyt, pp. 23, 116. Cf. also&mdash;'The
  tre <i>aresede</i> as hit wold falle'; Seven Sages, ed. Weber, l. 915.
  A.S. <i>hrysian</i>.</p>

  <p>1987. 'I suppose the <i>northern light</i> is the aurora borealis, but
  this phenomenon is so rarely mentioned by mediaeval writers, that it may
  be questioned whether Chaucer meant anything more than the faint and cold
  illumination received by reflexion through the door of an apartment
  fronting the north.' (Marsh.) The fact is, however, that Chaucer here
  copies Statius, Theb. vii. 40-58; see the translation in the note to l.
  2017 below. The 'northern light' seems to be an incorrect rendering of
  'aduersum Phoebi iubar'; l. 45.</p>

  <p>1990. 'E le porte eran d'eterno diamante'; Teseide, vii. 32. Such is
  the reading given by Warton. However, the ultimate source is the phrase
  in Statius&mdash;'adamante perenni ... fores'; Theb. vii. 68.</p>

  <p>1991. <i>overthwart</i>, &amp;c., across and along (i.&nbsp;e. from top to
  bottom). The same phrase occurs in Rich. Coer de Lion, 2649, in Weber,
  Met. Romances, ii. 104.</p>

  <p>1997, 8. Cf. the Teseide, vii. 33:&mdash;</p>

      <p>E le Paure pallide in quel loco.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But Chaucer follows Statius still more closely. Ll. 1195-2012 answer
  to Theb. vii. 48-53:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>1999. Cf. Rom. of the Rose, 7419-20. <!-- Page 80 --><span

  <p>2001. See Chaucer's Legend of Hypermnestra.</p>

  <p>2003. 'Discordia, <i>contake</i>'; Glossary in Reliquiae Antiquae, i.
  7.</p>

  <p>2004. <i>chirking</i> is used of grating and creaking sounds; and
  sometimes, of the cry of birds. The Lansd. MS. has <i>schrikeinge</i>
  (shrieking). See House of Fame, iii. 853 (or 1943). In Batman upon
  Bartholomè, lib. viii. c. 29, the music of the spheres is attributed to
  the '<i>cherkyng</i> of the mouing of the circles, and of the roundnes of
  heauen.' In Chaucer's tr. of Boethius, bk. i. met. 6, it is an adj., and
  translates <i>stridens</i>. Cf. D. 1804, I. 605.</p>

  <p>2007. This line contains an allusion to the death of Sisera, Judges
  iv. But Dr. Koch has pointed out (Essays on Chaucer, Chaucer Soc. iv.
  371) that we have here some proof that Chaucer may have altered his first
  draft of the poem without taking sufficient heed to what he was about.
  The original line may have stood&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'The sleer of <i>her husband</i> saw I there'&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>or something of that kind; for the reason that no suicide has ever yet
  been known to drive a nail into his own head. That a wife might do so to
  her husband is <i>Chaucer's own</i> statement; for, in the Cant. Tales,
  D. 765-770, we find&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Of latter date, of wives hath he red,</p>
      <p>That somme han slayn hir housbondes in hir bed ...</p>

      <p>Whyl that they slepte, and thus they han hem slayn.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of course it may be said that l. 2006 is entirely <i>independent</i>
  of l. 2007, and I have punctuated the text so as to suit this
  arrangement; but the suggestion is worth notice.</p>

  <p>2011. From Tes. vii. 35:&mdash;'Videvi ancora l'allegro
  Furore.'&mdash;Kölbing.</p>

  <p>2017. <i>hoppesteres.</i> Speght explains this word by pilots
  (<i>gubernaculum tenentes</i>); Tyrwhitt, female dancers (Ital.
  <i>ballatrice</i>). Others explain it <i>hopposteres</i> =
  <i>opposteres</i> = opposing, hostile, so that <i>schippes
  hoppesteres</i> = <i>bellatrices carinae</i> (Statius). As, however, it
  is impossible to suppose that even <i>opposteres</i> without the <i>h</i>
  can ever have been formed from the verb to <i>oppose</i>, the most likely
  solution is that Chaucer mistook the word <i>bellatrices</i> in Statius
  (vii. 57) or the corresponding Ital. word <i>bellatrici</i> in the
  Teseide, vii. 37, for <i>ballatrices</i> or <i>ballatrici</i>, which
  might be supposed to mean 'female dancers'; an expression which would
  exactly correspond to an M.&nbsp;E. form <i>hoppesteres</i>, from the A. S.
  <i>hoppestre</i>, a female dancer. Herodias' daughter is mentioned (in
  the dative case) as <i>þære lyðran hoppystran</i> (better spelt
  <i>hoppestran</i>) in Ælfric's A.&nbsp;S. Homilies, ed. Thorpe, i. 484. Hence
  <i>shippes hoppesteres</i> simply means 'dancing ships.' Shakespeare

  <p>2021. <i>infortune of Marte.</i> 'Tyrwhitt thinks that Chaucer might
  intend to be satirical in these lines; but the introduction of such
  apparently undignified incidents arose from the confusion already
  mentioned of the god of war with the planet to which his name was given,
  and the influence of which was supposed to produce all the disasters here
  mentioned. The following extract from the Compost of Ptolemeus gives some
  of the supposed effects of Mars:&mdash;"Under Mars is borne theves and
  robbers that kepe hye wayes, and do hurte to true men, and nyght-walkers,
  and quarell-pykers, bosters, mockers, and skoffers, and these men of Mars
  causeth warre and murther, and batayle; they wyll be gladly
  <i>smythes</i> or workers of yron, lyght-fyngred, and lyers, gret swerers
  of othes in vengeable wyse, and a great surmyler and crafty. He is red
  and angry, with blacke heer, and lytell iyen; he shall be a great walker,
  and a maker of swordes and knyves, and a sheder of mannes blode, and a
  fornycatour, and a speker of rybawdry ... and good to be a
  <i>barboure</i> and a blode-letter, and to drawe tethe, and is peryllous
  of his handes." The following extract is from an old astrological book of
  the sixteenth century:&mdash;"Mars denoteth men with red faces and the
  skinne redde, the face round, the eyes yellow, horrible to behold,
  furious men, cruell, desperate, proude, sedicious, souldiers, captaines,
  <i>smythes</i>, colliers, bakers, alcumistes, armourers, furnishers,
  <i>butchers</i>, chirurgions, <i>barbers</i>, sargiants, and hangmen,
  according as they shal be well or evill disposed."'&mdash;Wright. So also
  in Cornelius Agrippa, De Occulta Philosophia, lib. i. c. 22. <!-- Page 82

  <p>2029. For the story of Damocles, see Cicero, Tuscul. 5. 61; cf.
  Horace, Od. iii. 1. 17. And see Chaucer's tr. of Boethius, bk. iii. pr.
  5. 17. Most likely Chaucer got it from Boethius or from the Gesta
  Romanorum, cap. 143, since the <i>name</i> of Damocles is
  <i>omitted</i>.</p>

  <p>2037. <i>sterres</i> (Harl.) Elles. &amp;c. have <i>certres</i>
  (<i>sertres</i>); but this strange reading can hardly be other than a
  mistake for <i>sterres</i>, which is proved to be the right word by the
  parallel passage in The Man of Lawes Tale, B. 194-6.</p>

  <p>2041. In the note to l. 1955, I have quoted part of cap. v. of a work
  by Albricus. In cap. iii. (De Marte) of the same, we have a description
  of Mars, which should be compared. I quote all that is material. 'Erat
  enim eius figura tanquam unius hominis furibundi, in curru sedens,
  armatus lorica, et caeteris armis offensiuis et defensiuis.... Ante illum
  uero lupus ouem portans pingebatur, quia illud scilicet animal ab
  antiquis gentibus ipsi Marti specialiter consecratum est. Iste enim
  <i>Mauors</i> est, id est <i>mares uorans</i>, eo quod bellorum deus a
  gentibus dictus est.' Chaucer seems to have taken the notion of the wolf
  devouring a man from this singular etymology of <i>Mauors</i>.</p>

  <p>In cap. vii. (De Diana) of the same, there is a description of 'Diana,
  quae et Luna, Proserpina, Hecate nuncupatur.' Cf. l. 2313 below.</p>

  <p>2045. 'The names of two figures in geomancy, representing two
  constellations in heaven. Puella signifieth Mars retrogade, and Rubeus
  Mars direct.'&mdash;Note in Speght's Chaucer. It is obvious that this
  explanation is wrong as regards 'Mars retrograde' and 'Mars direct,'
  because a constellation cannot represent a single planet. It happens to
  be also wrong as regards 'constellations in heaven.' But Speght is
  correct in the main point, viz., that Puella and Rubeus are 'the names of
  two figures in geomancy.' Geomancy was described, under the title of
  'Divination by Spotting,' in The Saturday Review, Feb. 16, 1889. To form
  geomantic figures, proceed thus. Take a pencil, and hurriedly jot down on
  a paper a number of dots in a line, without counting them. Do the same
  three times more. Now count the dots, to see whether they are odd or
  even. If the dots in a line are <i>odd</i>, put down <i>one</i> dot on
  another small paper, half-way across it. If they are <i>even</i>, put
  down <i>two</i> dots, one towards each side; arranging the results in
  four rows, one beneath the other.</p>

  <p><i>Three</i> of the figures thus formed require our attention; the
  whole number being sixteen. Fig. 1 results from the dots being odd, even,
  odd, odd. Fig. 2, from even, odd, even, even. Fig. 3, from odd, odd,
  even, odd. These (as well as the rest of the sixteen figures) are given
  in Cornelius Agrippa, De Occulta Philosophia, lib. ii. cap. 48: De
  Figuris Geomanticis. Each 'Figure' had a 'Name,' belonged to an <!-- Page
  83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[83]</span>'Element,'
  and possessed a 'Planet' and a Zodiacal 'Sign.' Cornelius Agrippa gives
  our three 'figures' as below.</p>

  <p>Fig. 1 (Puella). Fig. 2 (Rubeus). Fig. 3 (Puer). That is, Fig. 1 is
  'Puella,' or 'Mundus facie'; element, water; planet, Venus; sign,
  Libra.</p>

  <p>Fig. 2 is 'Rubeus' or 'Rufus'; element, fire; planet, Mars; sign,
  Gemini.</p>

  <p>Fig. 3 is 'Puer,' or 'Flavus,' or 'Imberbis'; element, fire; planet,
  Mars; sign, Aries.</p>

  <p>Chaucer (or some one else) seems to have confused figures 1 and 3, or
  Puer with Puella; for Puella was dedicated to Venus. Rubeus is clearly
  right, as Mars was the red planet (l. 1747). I first explained this,
  somewhat more fully, in The Academy, March 2, 1889.</p>

  <i>sottil</i> colla sua arte.'&mdash;Kölbing, in Engl. Studien, ii.

  <p>2056. <i>Calistopee</i> = <i>Callisto</i>, a daughter of Lycaon, King
  of Arcadia, and companion of Diana. See Ovid's Fasti, ii. 153; Gower,
  Conf. Amantis, ed. Pauli, ii. 336.</p>

  <p>The nymph Callisto was changed into <i>Arctos</i> or the Great Bear;
  hence "Vrsa Maior" is written in the margin of E. Hn. Cp. Ln. This was
  sometimes confused with the other Arctos or Lesser Bear, in which was
  situate the <i>lodestar</i> or Polestar. Chaucer has followed this error.
  Callisto's son, Arcas, was changed into Arctophylax or Boötes: here again
  Chaucer says a <i>sterre</i>, when he means a whole constellation; as,
  perhaps, he does in other passages.'&mdash;Chaucer's Astrolabe, ed. Skeat
  (E. E. T. S.), pp. xlviii, xlix.</p>

  <p>2062, 2064. <i>Dane</i> = <i>Daphne</i>, a girl beloved by Apollo, and

  560; and Troilus, v. 1471.</p>

  <p>2074. <i>nat drawen to memorie</i> = not draw to memory, not call to
  mind.</p>

  <p>2079. Cf. 'gawdy greene. <i>subviridis</i>'; Prompt. Parv. This
  <i>gaudè</i> has nothing whatever to do with the E. sb. <i>gaud</i>, but
  answers to F. <i>gaudé</i>, the pp. of the verb <i>gauder</i>, to dye
  with weld; from the F. sb. <i>gaude</i>, weld. As to <i>weld</i>, see my
  note to The Former Age, 17; in <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  power. Lucina was a title both of Juno and Diana; see Vergil, Ecl. iv.

  thy lady, <i>benedicite</i>!' Troil. i. 780. <i>Benedicite</i> is
  equivalent to 'thank God,' and was used in saying graces. See Babees

  <p>2129. This is the 're Licurgo' of the Teseide, vi. 14; and the
  Lycurgus of the Thebaid, iv. 386, and of Homer, Il. vi. 130. But the
  description of him is partly taken from that of another warrior, Tes. vi.
  21, 22. It is worth notice that, in Lydgate's Story of Thebes, pt. iii.,
  king Ligurgus or Licurgus (the name is spelt both ways) is introduced,
  and Lydgate has the following remark concerning him:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And the kingdom, but-if bokes lye,</p>
      <p>Of Ligurgus, called was Trace;</p>

  <p>2134. '<i>kempe heres</i>, shaggy, rough hairs. Tyrwhitt and
  subsequent editors have taken for granted that <i>kempe</i> =
  <i>kemped</i>, combed (an impossible equation); but <i>kempe</i> is
  rather the reverse of this, and instead of smoothly combed, means
  bristly, rough, or shaggy. In an Early English poem it is said of

  Characters of the Middle Ages, p. 345, the bad guess is hazarded that

  <p>Lewis translates the last line by:&mdash;'The sharpness of the claws
  was dulled with gold.'</p>

  <p>2142. <i>for-old</i>, very old. See next note.</p>

  <p>2144. <i>for-blak</i> is generally explained as <i>for blackness</i>;
  it means <i>very black</i>. Cf. <i>fordrye</i>, very dry, in F. 409.</p>

  <p>2148. <i>alaunts</i>, mastiffs or wolf-hounds. Florio has:
  '<i>Alano</i>, a mastiue dog.' Cotgrave: '<i>Allan</i>, a kind of big,
  strong, thickheaded, and short-snowted dog; the brood where-of came first
  out of Albania (old Epirus).' Pineda's Span. Dict. gives: '<i>Alano</i>,
  a mastiff dog, particularly a bull dog; also, an <i>Alan</i>, one of that
  nation.' This refers to the tribe of <i>Alani</i>, a nation of warlike
  horsemen, first found in Albania. They afterwards became allies, first of
  the Huns, and afterwards of the Visi-Goths. It is thus highly probable
  that <i>Alaunt</i> (in which the <i>t</i> is obviously a later addition)
  signifies 'an Alanian dog,' which agrees with Cotgrave's explanation.
  Smith's Classical Dict. derives <i>Alanus</i>, said to mean
  'mountaineer,' from a Sarmatian word <i>ala</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>alaunt</i> is described in the Maister of the Game, c. 16. We
  there learn they were of all colours, and frequently white with a black
  spot about the ears.</p>

  <p>2152. <i>Colers of</i>, having collars of. Some MSS. read <i>Colerd
  of</i>, which I now believe to be right. <i>Collared</i> was an heraldic
  term, used of greyhounds, &amp;c.; see the New Eng. Dict. This leaves an
  awkward construction, as <i>torets</i> seems to be governed by
  <i>with</i>. See Launfal, 965, in Ritson, Met. Rom. i. 212. Cf. 'as they
  (the Jews) were tied up with girdles ... so were they <i>collared</i>
  about the neck.'&mdash;Fuller's Pisgah Sight of Palestine, p. 524, ed.
  1869.</p>

  <p><i>torets</i>, probably eyes in which rings will turn round, because
  each eye is a little larger than the thickness of the ring. This appears
  from Chaucer's Astrolabe, i. 2. 1&mdash;'This ring renneth in a maner
  turet,' i.&nbsp;e. in a kind of eye (vol. iii. p. 178). Warton, in his Hist.
  E. Poet. ed. 1871, ii. 314, gives several instances. It also meant a
  small loose ring. Cotgrave gives: '<i>Touret</i>, the annulet, or little
  ring whereby a hawk's lune is fastened unto the jesses.' 'My lityll bagge
  of blakke ledyr with a cheyne and <i>toret</i> of siluyr'; Bury Wills,
  ed. Tymms, p. 16. Cf. E. <i>swivel</i><span class="nw">-ring.</span></p>

  <p>2156. <i>Emetrius</i> is not mentioned either by Statius or by
  Boccaccio; cf. Tes. vi. 29, 17, 16, 41.</p>

  <p>2158. <i>diapred</i>, variegated with flowery or arabesque patterns.
  See <i>diaspre</i> and <i>diaspré</i> in Godefroy's O.&nbsp;F. Dict.;
  <i>diasprus</i> and <i>diasperatus</i> in Ducange. In Le Rom. de la Rose,
  21205, we find mention of <i>samis diaprés</i>, diapered samites.</p>

  <p>2160. <i>cloth of Tars</i>, 'a kind of silk, said to be the same as in
  other places is called <i>Tartarine</i> (<i>tartarinum</i>), the exact
  derivation of which appears to be somewhat uncertain.'&mdash;Wright. Cf.
  Piers the Plowman, B. xv. 224, and my note to the same, C. xvii. 299;

  <p>2217. <i>And in hir houre.</i> 'I cannot better illustrate Chaucer's
  astrology than by a quotation from the old Kalendrier de Bergiers, edit.
  1500, Sign. K. ii. b:&mdash;"Qui veult savoir comme bergiers scevent quel
  planete regne chascune heure du jour et de la nuit, doit savoir la
  planete du jour qui veult s'enquerir; et la premiere heure temporelle du
  soleil levant ce jour est pour celluy planete, la seconde heure est pour
  la planete ensuivant, et la tierce pour l'autre," &amp;c., in the
  following order: viz. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, Luna.
  To apply this doctrine to the present case, the first hour of the Sunday,
  reckoning from sunrise, belonged to the Sun, the planet of the day; the
  second to Venus, the third to Mercury, &amp;c.; and continuing this
  method of allotment, we shall find that the twenty-second hour also
  belonged to the Sun, and the twenty-third to Venus; so that the hour of
  Venus really was, as Chaucer says, two hours before the sunrise of the
  following day. Accordingly, we are told in l. 2271, that the third hour
  after Palamon set out for the temple of Venus, the Sun rose, and Emily
  began to go to the temple of Diane. It is not said that this was the hour
  of Diane, or the Moon, but it really was; for, as we have just seen, the
  twenty-third hour of Sunday belonging to Venus, the twenty-fourth must be
  given to Mercury, and the first hour of Monday falls in course to the
  Moon, the presiding planet of that day. After this, Arcite is described
  as walking to the temple of Mars, l. 2367, in <i>the nexte houre of
  Mars</i>, that is, the <i>fourth</i> hour of the day. It is necessary to
  take these words together, for <i>the nexte houre</i>, singly, would
  signify the <i>second</i> hour of the day; but that, according to the
  rule of rotation mentioned above, belonged to Saturn, as the <i>third</i>
  did to Jupiter. The <i>fourth</i> was <i>the nexte houre of Mars</i> that
  occurred after the hour last named.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. Thus Emily is two
  hours later than Palamon, and Arcite is three hours later than Emily.</p>

  <p>2221-64. To be compared with the Teseide, vii. 43-49, and vii. 68.</p>

  <p>2224. <i>Adoun</i>, Adonis. See Ovid, Met. x. 503.</p>

  <p>2238. 'I care not to boast of arms (success in arms).'</p>

  <p>2239. <i>Ne I ne axe</i>, &amp;c., are to be pronounced as <i>ni
  naxe</i>, &amp;c. So in l. 2630 of this tale, <i>Ne in</i> must be
  pronounced as <i>nin</i>.</p>

  <p>2252. <i>wher I ryde or go</i>, whether I ride or walk.</p>

  <p>2253. <i>fyres bete</i>, kindle or light fires. <i>Bete</i> also
  signifies to mend or make up the fire; see l. 2292.</p>

  <p>2271. <i>The thridde hour inequal.</i> 'In the astrological system,
  the day, from sunrise to sunset, and the night, from sunset to sunrise,
  being each divided into twelve hours, it is plain that the hours of the
  day and night were never equal except just at the equinoxes. The hours
  attributed to the planets were of this <i>unequal</i> sort. See
  Kalendrier de Berg. loc. cit., and our author's treatise on the

  the word in some form or other in most European languages, but in our own

  this.'&mdash;Marco <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>2684. Elles. reads <i>furie</i>, as noted; so in the Teseide, ix. 4.
  This incident is borrowed from Statius, Theb. vi. 495, where Ph&oelig;bus
  sends a hellish monster to frighten some horses in a chariot-race. And
  see Vergil, Æn. xii. 845.</p>

  <p>2689. The following is a very remarkable account of a contemporary
  occurrence, which took place at the time when a parliament was held at
  Cambridge, <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 1388, as told by Walsingham, ed.
  Riley, ii. 177:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Tempore Parliamenti, cum Dominus Thomas Tryvet cum Rege sublimis
  equitaret ad Regis hospitium, quod fuit apud Bernewelle [Barnwell], dum
  nimis urget equum calcaribus, equus cadit, et omnia pene interiora
  sessoris dirumpit [cf. l. 2691]; protelavit tamen vitam in crastinum.'
  The <i>saddle-bow</i> or <i>arsoun</i> was the 'name given to two curved
  pieces of wood or metal, one of which was fixed to the front of the
  saddle, and another behind, to give the rider greater security in his
  seat'; New Eng. Dict. s.&nbsp;v. <i>Arson</i>. Violent collision against the
  front saddle-bow produced very serious results. Cf. the Teseide, ix.
  8&mdash;'E 'l forte arcione gli premette il petto.' <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>[91]</span></p>

  <p>2696. 'Then was he cut out of his armour.' I.&nbsp;e. the laces were cut,
  to spare the patient trouble. Cf. Statius, Theb. viii. 637-641.</p>

  <p>2710. <i>That ... his</i>, i.&nbsp;e. whose. So <i>which ... his</i>, in
  Troil. ii. 318.</p>

  <p>2711. 'As a remedy <i>for</i> other wounds,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>2712, 3. <i>charmes ... save.</i> 'It may be observed that the salves,
  charms, and pharmacies of herbs were the principal remedies of the
  physician in the age of Chaucer. <i>Save</i> (<i>salvia</i>, the herb
  sage) was considered one of the most universally efficiently medieval
  remedies.'&mdash;Wright. Hence the proverb of the school of Salerno, 'Cur
  moriatur homo, dum salvia crescit in horto?'</p>

  <p>2722. <i>nis nat but</i> = is only. <i>aventure</i>, accident.</p>

  <p>2725. <i>O persone</i>, one person.</p>

  <p>2733. <i>Gree</i>, preëminence, superiority; lit. rank, or a step;
  answering to Lat. <i>gradus</i> (not <i>gratus</i>). The phrases <i>to
  win the gree</i>, i.&nbsp;e. to get the first place, and <i>to bear the
  gree</i>, i.&nbsp;e. to keep the first place, are still in common use in
  Scotland. See note to the Allit. Destruction of Troy, ed. Panton and
  Donaldson, l. 1353, and Jamieson's Dictionary.</p>

  <p>2736. <i>dayes three.</i> Wright says the period of three days was the
  usual duration of a feast among our early forefathers. As far back as the
  seventh century, when Wilfred consecrated his church at Ripon, he held
  'magnum convivium trium dierum et noctium, reges cum omni populo
  laetificantes.'&mdash;Eddius, Vit. S. Wilf. c. 17.</p>

  <p>2743. This fine passage is certainly imitated from the account of the
  death of Atys in Statius, Theb. viii. 637-651. I quote ll. 642-651, in

  1606; Troil. iv. 1193, 1274. With ll. 2761-2808 compare the Teseide, x.
  12, 37, 51, 54, 55, 64, 102-3, 60-3, 111-2.</p>

  <p>2800. <i>overcome.</i> Tyrwhitt reads <i>overnome</i>, overtaken, the
  pp. of <i>overnimen</i>; but none of the seven best MSS. have this
  reading.</p>

  <p>2810. The <i>real</i> reason why Chaucer could not here describe the
  passage of Arcite's soul to heaven is because he had already copied
  Boccaccio's description, and had used it with respect to the death of
  Troilus; see Troil. v. 1807-27 (stanzas 7, 8, 9 from the end).</p>

  <p>2815. <i>ther Mars</i>, &amp;c., where I hope that Mars will, &amp;c.;
  may Mars, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>2822. <i>swich sorwe</i>, so great sorrow. The line is defective in
  the third foot, which consists of a single (accented) syllable.</p>

  <p>2827-46. Cf. the Teseide, xi. 8, 7, 9-11, xii. 6.</p>

  <p>2853-962. Cf. the Teseide, xi. 13-16, 30, 31, 35, 38, 40, 37, 18,
  26-7, 22-5, 21, 27-9, 30, 40-67.</p>

  <p>2863-962. The whole of this description should be compared with the
  funeral rites at the burial of Archemorus, as described in Statius,
  Thebaid, bk. vi; which Chaucer probably consulted, as well as the
  imitation of the same in Boccaccio's Teseide. For example, the
  'tree-list' in ll. 2921-3 is not a little remarkable. The first list is
  in Ovid, Met. x. 90-105; with which cf. Vergil, Æn. vi. 180; Lucan,
  Pharsalia, iii. 440-445. Then we find it in Statius, vi. 98-106. After
  which, it reappears in Boccaccio, Teseide, xi. 22; in Chaucer, Parl. of
  Foules, 176; in the present passage; in Tasso, Gier. Lib. iii. 75; and in
  Spenser, F.Q. i. 1. 8. There is also a list in Le Roman de la Rose,
  1338-1368. Again, we may just compare ll. 2951-2955 with the following
  lines in Lewis's translation of Statius:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Around the pile an hundred horsemen ride,</p>
      <p>With arms reversed, and compass every side;</p>
      <p>They faced the left (for so the rites require);</p>
      <p>Bent with the dust, the flames no more aspire.</p>
      <p>Thrice, thus disposed, they wheel in circles round</p>
      <p>The hallow'd corse: their clashing weapons sound.</p>
      <p>Four times their arms a crash tremendous yield,</p>
      <p>And female shrieks re-echo through the field.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Moreover, Statius imitates the whole from Vergil, Æn. xi. 185-196. And
  Lydgate copies it all from Chaucer in his Sege of Thebes, part 3 (near
  the end).</p>

  <p>2864. <i>Funeral he myghte al accomplice</i> (Elles.); <i>Funeral he
  mighte hem all complise</i> (Corp., Pet.). The line is defective in the
  first foot. <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page93"></a>[93]</span><i>Funeral</i> is an adjective. Tyrwhitt and
  Wright insert <i>Of</i> before it, without authority of any kind; see l.
  2942.</p>

  <p>2874. <i>White</i> gloves were used as mourning at the funeral of an
  unmarried person; see Brand, Pop. Antiq. ed. Ellis, ii. 283.</p>

  <p>2885. 'And surpassing others in weeping came Emily.'</p>

  <p>2891. See the description of old English funerals in Rock, Church of
  our Fathers, ii. 488: 'If the deceased was a knight, his helmet, shield,
  sword, and coat-armour were each carried by some near kinsman, or by a
  herald clad in his blazoned tabard'; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>2895. Cf. 'deux ars Turquois,' i.&nbsp;e. two Turkish bows; Rom. de la
  Rose, 913; see vol. i. p. 132.</p>

  <p>2903. Compare the mention of 'blake clothes' in l. 2884. When 'master

  <p>The note in Bell's Chaucer, connecting it with <i>oaf</i>, is wrong.

  so common at Cambridge, where the number of students far exceeds the
  number of college-rooms.</p>

  <p>3192, 3. Chaucer himself knew something of astrology, as shewn by his
  numerous references to it. The word <i>conclusions</i> in l. 3193 is the
  technical name for 'propositions' or problems. In his Treatise on the
  Astrolabe, prologue (l. 9), he says to his son Lowis&mdash;'I purpose to
  teche thee a certein nombre of <i>conclusions</i> apertening to the same
  <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>[97]</span>instrument.' We here learn that one object
  of astrology was to answer questions relating to coming weather, as well
  as with reference to almost every other future event.</p>

  <p>3195. <i>in certein houres.</i> In astrology, much depended on times;
  certain times were supposed to be more favourable than others for
  obtaining solutions of problems. The great book for prognostications of
  weather was the <i>Calendrier des Bergiers</i>, an English version of
  which was frequently reprinted as The Shepheards Kalendar. The old
  almanacks also predicted the weather; see Ben Jonson's Every Man Out of
  his Humour, A. i. sc. 1&mdash;'Enter <i>Sordido</i>, with an almanack in
  his hand.'</p>

  <p>3199. <i>hende</i>, gracious, mild; hence, gentle, courteous; orig.
  near at hand, hence, useful, serviceable; A.&nbsp;S. <i>gehende</i>. Ill spelt
  <i>hendy</i> in Tyrwhitt. Several passages from this Tale are quoted and
  illustrated by Warton, Hist. E. Poetry, sect. xvi; which see.</p>

  whereas it was usual for two or more students to have a room in common,
  even in college.</p>

  <p>3207. <i>cetewale</i>, zedoary; but commonly, though improperly,
  applied to valerian (<i>Valeriana pyrenaica</i>); also spelt
  <i>setwall</i>. Gerarde, in his Herball (ed. 1597, p. 919), says that 'it

  northerne parts) in such veneration amongst them, that no brothes,

  wrote four books of judicial astrology. He was an Egyptian astrologist,
  and flourished under Marcus Antoninus.'&mdash;Warton. See D. 182, 325,

  <p><i>longinge for</i>, suitable for, belonging to.</p>

  <p>3210. <i>augrim-stones</i>, counters for calculation. <i>Augrim</i> is
  <i>algorism</i> (see New Eng. Dict.), or the Arabic system of arithmetic,
  performed with the Arabic numerals, which became known in Europe from
  translations of a work on algebra by the Arab mathematician Abu Ja'far
  Mohammed Ben Musa, surnamed <i>al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;</i>, or the

  <p>Hence the subject of the anthem is the Annunciation.</p>

  <p>3217. <i>the kinges note</i>, the name of some tune or song. There is
  nothing to identify it with a <i>chant royal</i>, described by Warton,
  Hist. E. Poet. ii. 221, note <i>b</i>. Warton says that 'Chaucer calls
  the <i>chant royal</i> ... a <i>kingis note</i>.' But Chaucer says
  '<i><span class="sm">THE</span> kinges note</i>,' which makes all the
  difference; it is merely a bad guess. A song entitled 'Kyng villyamis
  note,' or 'King William's note,' is mentioned in the Complaint of
  Scotland (1549), ed. Murray, p. 64.</p>

  <p>3220. 'According to the money provided by his friends and his own
  income.'</p>

  <p>3223. <i>eight-e-ten-e</i> has four syllables; cf. B. 5. Tyrwhitt read
  it as of <i>two</i> syllables, and inserted <i>I gesse</i> after <i>she
  was</i>. He duly notes that the words <i>I gesse</i> are 'not in the
  MSS.'</p>

  <p>3226. 'And considered himself to be like.' Tyrwhitt has <i>belike</i>,
  which he probably took to be an adverb; but this is a gross anachronism.
  The adv. <i>belike</i> is unknown earlier than the year 1533.</p>

  <p>3227. <i>Catoun</i>, Dionysius Cato; see note to G. 688. But Tyrwhitt
  notes, that 'the maxim here alluded to is not properly one of Cato's; but
  I find it (he says) in a kind of Supplement to the Moral Distichs

  live together';&mdash;<i>Passionate Pilgrim</i>.</p>

  <p>3235. <i>ceynt</i>, girdle; <i>barred</i>, adorned with cross stripes.
  Warton could not understand the word; but a <i>bar</i> is a transverse
  stripe on a girdle or belt, as in A. 329, which see.</p>

  <p>3236-7. <i>barm-clooth</i>, lap-cloth, i.&nbsp;e. an apron 'over her
  loins.' <i>gore</i>, a triangular slip, used as an insertion to widen a
  garment in any particular place. The apron spread out towards the bottom,
  owing rather, it appears, to inserted 'gores' below than to pleats above.
  Or the pleats may be called gores here, from their triangular shape. <!--

  <i>Of</i> in l. 3240 means 'with.'</p>

  <p>3241. <i>voluper</i>, lit. 'enveloper' or 'wrapper'; hence, kerchief,

  translates Lat. <i>calamandrum</i> (568, 28), <i>inuolutarium</i> (590,
  28), and <i>mafora</i> (594, 19). In the Prompt. Parv. we find:
  '<i>volypere</i>, kerche, <i>teristrum</i>'; and in the Catholicon,
  '<i>volyper</i>, caliend[r]um.' In Baret's Alvearie, h. 596, we find: 'A
  woman's cap, hood, or bonet, <i>Calyptra</i>, <i>Caliendrum</i>.' The
  tapes of this cap were 'of the same suit' as the embroidery of her
  collar, i.&nbsp;e. were of black silk.</p>

  <p>3245. <i>smale y-pulled</i>, i.&nbsp;e. partly plucked out, to make them
  narrow, even, and well-marked.</p>

  <p>3247. Tyrwhitt at first had '<i>for</i> to see,' but corrected it to
  '<i>on</i> to see,' i.&nbsp;e. to look upon. Cf. Leg. Good Women, 2425.</p>

  <p>3248. <i>pere-ionette</i>, early-ripe pear. Tyrwhitt refers us to a F.
  <i>poire jeunette</i>, or an Ital. <i>pero giovanetto</i>, i.&nbsp;e. very
  young pear-tree; but I believe the explanation is as imaginary as are
  these terms, which I seek for in vain. I take it that he has been misled
  by a false etymology from F. <i>jeune</i>, Ital. <i>giovane</i>, young,
  whereas the reference is to the early-ripe pear called in O.&nbsp;F. <i>poire
  de hastivel</i> (F. <i>hâtiveau</i>); see <i>hastivel</i> in Godefroy.
  The corresponding E. term is <i>gennitings</i>, applied to apples, but
  applicable to pears also; and I take the etymology to be from F.
  <i>Jean</i>, John, because such apples and pears ripen about St. John's
  day (June 24), which is very early. Cotgrave has: '<i>Hastivel</i>, a
  soon-ripe apple, called the St. John's apple.' Littré, s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>poire</i>, has: 'La poire appellée à Paris <i>de messire Jean</i> est
  celle qu'en Dauphiné et Languedoc l'on nomme <i>de coulis</i>.' Lacroix
  (Manners, &amp;c. during the Middle Ages, p. 116) says that, in the
  thirteenth century, one of the best esteemed pears was the
  <i>hastiveau</i>, which was 'an early sort, and no doubt the golden pear
  now called St. Jean.' Finally, we learn from Piers Plowman, C. xiii. 221,
  that 'pere-Ionettes' were very sweet and very early ripe, and therefore
  very soon rotten; see my note to that line. The text, accordingly,
  compares this young and forward beauty to the <i>newe</i> (i.&nbsp;e.
  fresh-leaved) early-ripe pear-tree; and there is much propriety in the
  simile. Of course, this explanation is somewhat of a guess; and perhaps I
  may add another possible etymology, viz. from <i>jaune</i>, yellow, with
  reference to the golden colour of the pear. Cf. <i>jaulnette</i>, in
  Cotgrave, as a name for St. John's wort, and the form
  <i>floure-jonettis</i> in the King's Quair, st. 47.</p>

  <p>3251. 'With silk tassels, and pearls (or pearl-shaped knobs or
  buttons) made of the metal called <i>latoun</i>.' Such is Tyrwhitt's
  simple explanation. In Riley's Memorials of London, p. 398, we find that
  a man was accused of having 'silvered 240 buttons of <i>latone</i> ...
  for <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>[100]</span>purses.' The notes in Warton are doubly
  misleading, first confusing <i>latoun</i> with <i>cheklatoun</i> (which
  are unconnected words), and then quoting the expression 'perled cloth of
  gold,' which is another thing again. As to <i>latoun</i>, see note to C.
  350, and cf. A. 699, B. 2067, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>3254. <i>popelote</i>, darling, poppet. Not connected with
  <i>papillon</i>, but with F. <i>poupée</i> and E. <i>puppet</i>.
  Halliwell gives: '<i>Poplet</i>, a term of endearment, generally applied
  to a young girl: <i>poppet</i> is still in common use.' Cotgrave has:
  '<i>Popelin</i>, masc. a little finicall darling.' Godefroy gives:
  '<i>poupelet</i>, m. petit poupon.'</p>

  <p>3256. Wright says: 'The gold noble of this period was a very beautiful
  coin; specimens are engraved in Ruding's Annals of the Coinage. It was
  coined in the Tower of London [as here said], the place of the principal
  London mint.' It was worth 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and first coined about
  1339. See C. 907, and note.</p>

  <p>3258. 'Sitting on a barn.' Repeated in C. 397.</p>

  <p>3261. <i>bragot</i>, a sweet drink, made of ale and honey fermented
  together; afterwards, the honey was replaced by sugar and spice. See
  <i>Bragget</i> in New E. Dict. The full receipt for 'Braket' is given in
  Strutt, Manners and Customs, iii. 74; it contained 4 gallons of ale to a
  pint of honey. In 1783, it was made of ale, sugar, and spices, and drunk
  at Easter; Brand, Pop. Antiq. i. 112. Spelt <i>bragot</i>, Palladius on
  Husbandry, p. 90, l. 812; &amp;c. Of British origin; Welsh
  <i>bragawd</i>; cf. O. Irish <i>brac</i>, later <i>braich</i>, malt. See
  also the note on <i>Bragott</i> in the Catholicon, ed. Herrtage.</p>

  <p>3262. Cf. 'An appyll-hurde, <i>pomarium</i>'; Catholicon Anglicum.</p>

  <p>3263-4. These two lines are cited by Dryden with approval, in the
  Preface to his Fables, as being 'not much behind our present English.' We
  are amazed to find that Dryden condemns Chaucer's lines as unequal; and
  coolly remarks that 'equality of numbers ... was either not known, or not
  always practised in Chaucer's age.' The black-letter editions which
  Dryden read were, in fact, full of misspelt words; but even in them, he
  might have found plenty of good lines, if he had not been so prejudiced
  and (to say the truth) conceited.</p>

  <p>3268. <i>prymerole</i>, primrose; as in Gower, C. A. iii. 130.
  <i>pigges-nye</i>, pig's eye, a term of endearment; pig's eyes being (as
  Tyrwhitt notes) remarkably small. Cf. 'Waked with a wench, pretty peat,
  pretty love, and my sweet pretty <i>pigsnie</i>'; Peele, Old Wives' Tale,
  ed. Dyce (1883), p. 455, col. 1. And see Skelton, ed. Dyce, i. 28, ii.
  97, 104. In fact, it is common. Brand, quoting Douce (Illust. of Shak.
  ii. 151), says that 'Shadwell not only uses the word <i>pigsney</i> in
  this sense, but also <i>birdsney</i> [bird's eye]; see his Plays, i. 357,
  iii. 385.' See also <i>pigsney</i> in Todd's Johnson, where one quotation
  has the form <i>pigs eie</i>. <i>An ye</i> became <i>a nye</i>; hence the
  pl. <i>nyes</i>, and even <i>nynon</i> (= eyne), as in Halliwell. See
  note to P. Plowman, C. xx. 306, where <i>bler-eyed</i>, i.&nbsp;e. blear-eyed,
  appears as <i>bler-nyed</i> in the B-text.</p>

  <p>3269. <i>leggen</i>, to lay. Tyrwhitt has <i>liggen</i>, to lie, which
  is but poor grammar. <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>3274. <i>Oseneye</i>, Oseney, in the suburbs of Oxford, where there
  was an Abbey of St. Austin's Canons; cf. l. 3666.</p>

  <p>3286. <i>harrow</i> (Pt. <i>harowe</i>), a cry for help, a cry of
  distress; O. F. <i>haro</i>, <i>harou</i>, the same; see Godefroy. Cf.

  inserts <i>Of</i> before <i>Cristes</i>, and coolly observes, in his
  Notes, that it is 'added from conjecture only.' He might have said, that
  it makes bad grammar. And it is from such manipulated lines as this that
  the public forms its judgement of Chaucer's verse! Is it <i>nothing</i>
  that all the authorities begin the line alike?</p>

  <p>3316. <i>shode</i>, not 'hair,' as in Tyrwhitt, but 'parting of the
  hair.'</p>

  <p>3318. 'It was the fashion to wear shoes with the upper leather cut
  into a variety of beautiful designs, resembling the tracery of
  window-heads, through which the bright colour of the green, blue, or
  scarlet stocking beneath was shewn to great advantage';&mdash;Rock,
  Church of our Fathers, ii. 239, with illustrations at p. 240. <i>Poules
  windowes</i>, windows like those in St. Paul's Cathedral; hence, designs
  resembling them. Wright conjectures that there may even be a reference to
  the rose-window of old St. Paul's; and he says that examples of such
  shoes still exist, in the museum of Mr. C. Roach Smith. Good
  illustrations of these beautifully cut shoes are given in Fairholt's
  Costume, pp. 64, 65, who also notes that 'in Dugdale's view of old St.
  Paul's ... the rose-window in the transept is strictly analogous in
  design.' The Latin name for such shoes was <i>calcei fenestrati</i>,
  which see in Ducange. Rock also quotes the phrase <i>corium
  fenestratum</i> from Pope Innocent III. Observe the mention of his
  scarlet hose in the next line. Cf. note to Rom. of the Rose, 843, in vol.
  i. p. 423.</p>

  <p>3321. <i>wachet</i>, a shade of blue. Tyrwhitt wrongly connects it
  with the town of <i>Watchet</i>, in Somersetshire. But it is French.
  Littré, s.&nbsp;v. <i>vaciet</i>, gives: 'Couleur d'hyacinthe ou
  <i>vaciet</i>,' colour of the hyacinth, or <i>bilberry</i> (Lat.
  <i>uaccinium</i>). Roquefort defines <i>vaciet</i> as a shrub which bears
  a dark fruit fit for dyeing violet; it is applied, he <!-- Page 102
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>[102]</span>says, both to
  the fruit and the dye; and he calls it <i>Vaccinium hysginum</i>.
  Phillips says <i>watchet</i> is 'a kind of blew colour.' Todd's Johnson
  cites from Milton's Hist. of Muscovia, c. 5, '<i>watchet</i> or
  sky-coloured cloth'; and the line, 'Who stares, in Germany, at
  <i>watchet</i> eyes,' tr. of Juvenal, Sat. xiii, wrongly attributed to
  Dryden. See examples in Nares from Browne, Lyly, Drayton, and Taylor:
  and, in Richardson, from Beaumont and Fletcher, Hackluyt, Spenser, and
  Ben Jonson. Cotgrave explains F. <i>pers</i> as 'watchet, blunket,
  skie-coloured,' and <i>couleur perse</i> as 'skie-colour, azure-colour, a
  blunket, or light blue.' See <i>Blunket</i> in the New E. Dict., and my
  article in Philolog. Soc. Trans. Nov. 6, 1885, p. 329. Webster has
  '<i>watchet</i> stockings,' The Malcontent, A. iii. sc. 1. Lydgate has
  '<i>watchet</i> blewe'; see Warton, Hist. Eng. Poet. (1840), ii. 280.</p>

  <p>3322. <i>poyntes</i>, tagged laces, as in Shakespeare. MS. Hl. has
  here a totally different line, involving the word <i>gores</i> (cf. l.
  3237 above), viz. 'Schapen with goores in the newe get,' i.&nbsp;e. in the new
  fashion.</p>

  <p>3329. Tyrwhitt says:&mdash;'The school of Oxford seems to have been in
  much the same estimation for its dancing, as that of Stratford for its
  French'; see l. 125. He probably meant this satirically; but it may mean
  the very opposite, or something nearly so. The Stratford-at-Bow French
  was excellent of its kind, but unlike that of France (see note to l.
  125); and probably the Oxford dancing was, likewise, of no mean quality
  after its kind, having twenty 'maneres.'</p>

  <p>3331. <i>rubible</i>; also <i>ribible</i> (4396). Cf. 'where was his
  fedylle [fiddle] or hys <i>ribible</i>'; Knight de la Tour, cap. 117. See
  <i>Ribibe</i>, <i>Ribible</i> in Halliwell; The Squire of Low Degree (in
  Ritson), l. 1071; Warton, Hist. Eng. Poetry, ii. 194. Also called a
  <i>rebeck</i>, as in Milton. A two-stringed musical instrument, played
  with a bow, of Moorish origin; Arab. <i>rab&#x101;b</i>. '<i>Hec
  vitula</i>, a rybybe'; Wright's Gloss. 738. 19.</p>

  <p>3332. <i>quinible.</i> Not a musical instrument, as Tyrwhitt supposed,
  but a kind of voice. It is not singing consecutive fifths upon a plain
  song, as Mr. Chappell once thought (Pop. Music of the Olden Time, i. 34);
  but, as afterwards explained by him in Notes and Queries, 4 S. vi. 117,
  it refers to a very high voice. The <i>quinible</i> was an octave higher
  than the <i>treble</i>; the <i>quatreble</i> was an octave higher than
  the mean. The <i>mean</i> was intermediate between the <i>plain-song</i>
  or <i>tenor</i> (so called from its <i>holding on</i> the notes) and the
  <i>treble</i>. It means 'at the extreme pitch of the voice.' Skelton
  miswrites it <i>quibyble</i>.</p>

  <p>3333. <i>giterne</i>, a kind of guitar. 'The gittern and the kit the
  wand'ring fiddlers like'; Drayton, Polyolbion, song 4. See note to P. Pl.
  C. xvi. 208; Prompt. Parv. p. 196.</p>

  <p>3337. <i>squaymous</i>, squeamish, particular. Tyrwhitt says&mdash;'I
  know not how to make this sense agree with what follows' (l. 3807). But
  it is easy to understand that he was, ordinarily, squeamish, retentive;
  exceptionally, far otherwise. In the Knight de la Tour, cap. cxiv, p.
  155, there is a story of a lady who waited on her old husband, and nursed
  him under most trying conditions; 'and unnethe there might <!-- Page 103
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[103]</span>haue be founde
  a woman but atte sum tyme she wolde haue lothed her, or ellys to haue be
  right <i>scoymous</i> ta haue do the seruice as thes good lady serued her
  husbonde contynuelly.' In a version of the Te Deum, composed about 1400,
  we read&mdash;'Thou were not <i>skoymus</i> of the maidens wombe';
  Maskell, Monumenta Ritualia, ii. 14<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>. Cf. '<i>squaymose</i>, verecundus,'
  Catholicon; '<i>skeymowse</i>, or <i>sweymows</i> or <i>queymows</i>,
  abhominativus'; Prompt. Parv. Spelt <i>squmous</i> (badly), Court of
  Love, l. 332; and <i>sqymouse</i> in Morris's reprint of it. See
  <i>Desdaigneux</i> in Cotgrave. 'To be <i>squamish</i>, or nice,
  <i>delicias facere</i>'; Baret's Alvearie. 'They that be subiect to
  Saturne ... be not <i>skoymous</i> of foule and stinking clothing';
  Batman on Bartholomè, lib. 8. c. 23. In Weber's Metrical Romances, i.
  359, we find:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Than was the leuedi of the hous</p>
      <p>A proude dame and an envieous,</p>

      <p style="margin-left:6.8em">Lay le Freine, ll. 59-62.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These examples quite establish the sense. The derivation is from the
  rare A. F. <i>escoymous</i>, which occurs in P. Meyer's ed. of Nicole
  Bozon (Soc. des Anc. Textes Français), p. 158:&mdash;'si il poy mange e
  beyt poy, lors est gageous ou <i>escoymous</i>,' if he eats and drinks
  little, then is he delicate or nice. Robert of Brunne has the spelling
  <i>esquaymous</i>; Handlyng Synne, l. 7249.</p>

  <p>3338. <i>dangerous</i>, sparing; see the Glossary.</p>

  <p>3340. Cutts (Scenes and Characters of the Middle Ages, p. 219) seems
  to think that the clerk went <i>about the parish</i> with his censer, as
  he sometimes certainly went about with holy water. Warton, on the other
  hand, says that 'on holidays it was his business to carry the censer
  <i>about the church</i>, and he takes this opportunity of casting
  unlawful glances on the handsomest ladies of the parish.' Warton is
  clearly right here, for there is an allusion to the ladies coming forward
  with the usual offering (l. 3350); cf. note to A. 450. And see Persones
  Tale, l. 407.</p>

  <p>3354. <i>for paramours</i>, for love's sake: a redundant expression,
  since <i>par</i> means 'for.' Cf. n. to l. 1155, at p. 67.</p>

  <p>3358. <i>shot-windowe.</i> Brockett's Northern Glossary gives:
  '<i>Shot-window</i>, a projecting window, common in old houses'; but this
  may have been copied from Horne Tooke, who seems to have guessed at, and
  misunderstood, the passage, below, in Gawain Douglas. In the new edition
  of Jamieson, Mr. Donaldson defines <i>Schot</i> as 'a window set on
  hinges and opening like a shutter,' and explains that, 'in the West of
  Scotland, a projecting window is called an <i>out-shot window</i>,
  whereas a <i>shot-window</i> or <i>shot</i> is one that can be opened or
  shut like <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>[104]</span>a door or shutter by turning on its
  hinges.' It is material to the story that the window here mentioned
  should be readily opened and shut. The passage in G. Douglas's tr. of
  Virgil, prol. to bk. vii, evidently refers to a window of this character,
  as the poet first says:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Ane <i>schot-wyndo</i> vnschet a lytill on char,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. I unshut the shot-window, and left it a little ajar; and he goes
  on to say that the weather was so cold that he soon shut it
  again&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>See also ll. 3695, 6 below. In the next line, <i>upon</i> merely means
  'in' or 'formed in.'</p>

  <p>It is curious that, in Bell's Chaucer, a quotation is given from the
  Ballad of <i>Clerk Saunders</i> (Border Minstrelsy, vol. ii.) to shew
  that <i>shot-window</i> cannot mean '<i>shut</i> window.' But it does not
  prove that it cannot mean 'hinge-shutting window,' as I have shewn the
  right sense to be.</p>

  <p>3361. Tyrwhitt absurdly says that ll. 3361, 3362 should be broken into
  four short verses, and that <i>ladý</i> (sic) rimes with <i>be</i>! In
  Bell's edition, they are printed in small type! They are just ordinary
  lines; and <i>be</i> (pronounced nearly as modern <i>bay</i>) certainly
  never rimed with <i>lády</i>&mdash;nor yet with <i>la-dý</i>&mdash;in
  Chaucer's time, when the final <i>y</i> was sounded like the modern
  <i>ee</i> in <i>meet</i>, and would rather have rimed with a word like
  <i>my</i>. It is a mere whim.</p>

  <p>3375. <i>menes</i>, intermediate people, go-betweens; see <i>Mene</i>,
  sb., in Gloss. to P. Plowman, with numerous references. <i>Brocage</i> is
  the employment of a 'broker' or agent, and so means much the same. See
  <i>Brokage</i> in New E. Dict., and <i>Brocage</i> in Gloss. to P.
  Plowman.</p>

  <p>3377. <i>brokkinge</i>, with quick regular interruptions, quavering,
  in a 'broken' manner. See <i>Brock</i> in New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>3379. <i>wafres</i>, wafers. 'They (F. <i>gaufres</i>) are usually
  sold at fairs, and are made of a kind of batter poured into an iron
  instrument, which shuts up like a pair of snuffers. It is then thrust
  into the fire, and when it is with-drawn and opened, the <i>gaufre</i>,
  or wafer, is taken out and eaten "piping hote out of the glede," as here
  described.'&mdash;Note in Bell's Chaucer.</p>

  <p>3380. <i>mede</i>, reward, money; distinct from <i>meeth</i>, mead, in
  l. 3378. The sense of <i>mede</i> is very amply illustrated in P.
  Plowman. L. 3380 intimates that, as she lived in a town, she could spend
  money at any time.</p>

  <p>3382. A side-note, in several MSS., says: 'Unde Ouidius: Ictibus
  agrestis.' But the quotation is not from Ovid.</p>

  <p>3384. The parish-clerks often took part in the Mystery Plays. The part
  of Herod was an important one; cf. Hamlet, iii. 2. 15. <!-- Page 105

  <p>3387. 'I presume this was a service that generally went
  unrewarded.'&mdash;Wright. It was like 'piping in an ivy-leaf'; see A.
  1838.</p>

  <p>3389. <i>ape</i>, dupe; as in A. 706.</p>

  <p>Hending, among his Proverbs, has&mdash;'Fer from eye, fer from herte,'
  answering to the mod. E. 'out of sight, out of mind.' Kemble cites: 'Quod
  raro cernit oculi lux, cor cito spernit,' from MS. Trin. Coll., fol. 365.
  Also 'Qui procul est oculis, procul est a lumine cordis,' from Gartner,
  Dict. 8 b.</p>

  <p>3427. <i>deyde</i>, should die; subjunctive mood.</p>

  <p>3445. <i>kyked</i>, stared, gazed; see l. 3841. Cf. Scotch
  <i>keek</i>, to peep, pry; Burns has it in his Twa Dogs, l. 58.</p>

  <p>3449. The carpenter naturally invokes St. Frideswide, as there was a
  priory of St. Frideswide at Oxford, the church of which has become the
  present cathedral. The shrine of St. Frideswide is still to be seen,
  though in a fragmentary state, at the east end of the cathedral, on its
  former site near the original chancel-arches and wall of her early stone
  church. In this line, <i>seint-e</i> has the fem. suffix.</p>

  <p>3451. <i>astromye</i> is obviously intentional, as it fills up the
  line, and is repeated six lines below. The carpenter was not strong in
  technical terms. In like manner, he talks of 'Nowelis flood'; see note to
  l. 3818. The reading <i>astronomy</i> just spoils both lines, and loses
  the jest.</p>

  <p>3456. 'That knows nothing at all except his Creed.'</p>

  <p>3457. This story is told of Thales by Plato, in his Theaetetus; it
  also occurs, says Tyrwhitt, in the Cento Novelle Antiche, no. 36. It has
  often been repeated, and may now be found in James's edition of Æsop,
  1852, Fable 170.</p>

  <p>3469. Nearly repeated from A. 545.</p>

  <p>3479. 'I defend thee with the sign of the cross from elves and living
  creatures.' At the same time, the carpenter would make the sign over him.
  <i>Wightes</i> does not mean 'witches,' as Tyrwhitt thought, but
  'creatures.' Cf. l. 3484.</p>

  <p>3480. <i>night-spel</i>, night-spell, a charm said at night to keep
  off evil spirits. The carpenter says it five times, viz. towards the four
  corners of the house and on the threshold. The charm is contained in
  lines 3483-6, and is partly intentional nonsense, as such charms often
  were. See several unintelligible examples in Cockayne's Leechdoms, iii.
  286. The object of saying it four times towards the four corners of the
  house was to invoke the four evangelists, just as in the child's hymn
  still current, which is, in fact, a charm:&mdash; <!-- Page 106 --><span

      <p class="hg1">'Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</p>
      <p>Bless the bed that I lie on;</p>
      <p>Four angels round my bed,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Lines 3483-4 are clear, viz. 'May Jesus Christ and St. Benedict bless
  this house from every wicked creature.' As this is a reproduction of a
  popular saying, it is not necessary that the lines should scan; still,
  they run correctly, if we pronounce <i>seynt</i> as <i>se-ynt</i>, as
  elsewhere (note to A. 509), and if we take both to be defective at the
  beginning. The last two lines are mere scraps of older charms. It is just
  possible that <i>for nightes verye</i><a name="NtA_25"
  href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> represents an A.&nbsp;S. <i>for nihte
  werigum</i>, 'against the evil spirits of night'; against whom 'the white
  Paternoster' is to be said. The reading <i>white</i> is perfectly
  correct. There really was a prayer so called. See Notes and Queries, 1
  Ser. xi. 206, 313; whence we learn that the charm above quoted, beginning
  'Matthew, Mark,' &amp;c., resembles one in the <i>Patenôtre Blanche</i>,
  to be found in the (apocryphal) Enchiridion Leonis Papae (Romae, <span
  class="sm">MDCLX</span>), where occurs:&mdash;'Petite Patenôtre Blanche,
  que Dieu fit, que Dieu dit, que Dieu mit en Paradis. Au soir m'allant
  coucher, je trouvis trois anges à mon lit, couchès, un aux pieds, deux au
  chevet'; &amp;c. Here is a charm that mentions it, quoted in Notes and
  Queries, 1 Ser. viii. 613:&mdash;</p>

  </div>

  <p>The mention of St. Peter's brother is remarkable. It is a substitution
  for the older 'Saint Peter's sister' here mentioned. Again, St. Peter's
  sister is a substitution for St. Peter's daughter, who is a well-known
  saint, usually called St. Petronilla, or, in English, Saint Parnell, once
  a very common female name, and subsequently a surname. Her day is May 31,
  and she was said to cure the quartan ague; see Brand, Pop. Antiq., ed.
  Ellis, i. 363. A curious passage in the Ancren Riwle, p. 47, gives
  directions for crossing oneself at night, and particularly mentions the
  use of four crosses on 'four halves,' or in the original, 'vour creoices
  a uour halue'; with the remark 'Crux fugat omne malum,' &amp;c. For
  'Rural Charms,' see the chapter in Brand's Popular Antiquities, vol.
  iii.; and see the charm against rats in Political and Love Poems, ed.
  Furnivall, p. 23. I may add that, in Kemble's Solomon and Saturn, p. 136,
  is an A.&nbsp;S. poem, in which the Paternoster is <i>personified</i>, and
  destroys evil spirits. In Longfellow's Golden Legend, § II., Lucifer is
  made to say a <i>Black</i> Paternoster.</p>

  <p>3507. 'That, if you betray me, you shall go mad (as a punishment).'
  <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>[107]</span></p>

  <p>3509. <i>labbe</i>, chatterbox, talkative person. In P. Plowm. C.
  xiii. 39, we find the phrase 'ne <i>labbe</i> it out,' i.&nbsp;e. do not
  chatter about it, do not utter it foolishly. In the Romans of Partenay,
  ed. Skeat, 3751, we find: 'a <i>labbyng</i> tonge'; and Chaucer has
  elsewhere: 'a <i>labbing</i> shrewe,' E. 2428. Sewel's Du. Dict. (1754)
  gives: '<i>labben</i>, or <i>labbekakken</i>, to blab, chat'; also
  '<i>labbekak</i>, a tattling gossip, a common blab'; and '<i>labbery</i>,
  chat, idle talk.'</p>

  <p>3512. <i>him</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Christ. The story of the Harrowing (or
  despoiling) of Hell by Christ is derived from the apocryphal Gospel of
  Nicodemus, and is a favourite and common subject in our older authors. It
  describes the descent of Christ into hell, after His crucifixion, in
  order to release the souls of the patriarchs, whom He takes with Him to
  paradise. It is given at length in P. Plowman, Text C. Pass. xxi; and was
  usually introduced into the mystery plays; see the Coventry Mysteries,
  the York Plays, &amp;c. See also Cursor Mundi, 17,863; Ayenbite of Inwyt,
  p. 12; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>3516. 'On Monday next, at the end of the first quarter of the night,'
  i.&nbsp;e. about 9 <span class="sm">P.M.</span> Cf. ll. 3554, 3645.</p>

  <p>3530. See Ecclesiasticus, xxxii. 24 [Eng. version, 19]; this was not
  said by 'Solomon,' but by Jesus, son of Sirach. It is quoted again in the
  Tale of Melibeus; B. 2193.</p>

  <p>3539. 'The trouble endured by Noah and his company.' <i>Noë</i> is the
  form in the Latin Vulgate version. The allusion is to the intentionally
  comic scene introduced into the mystery plays, as, e.&nbsp;g. in the Chester
  Plays, the Towneley Plays, and the York Plays, in which Noah and his sons
  (<i>felawshipe</i>) have much ado to induce Noah's wife to enter the ark;
  and, in the course of the scene, she gives Noah a sound box on the
  ear.</p>

  <p>3548. <i>kimelin</i>, a large shallow tub; especially one used for
  brewing; see Prompt. Parv. p. 274; and <i>Kimnell</i> in Miss Jackson's
  Shropshire Glossary.</p>

  <p>3554. <i>pryme</i>, i.&nbsp;e. about 9 <span class="sm">A.M.</span> See

  <p>3565. This shows that the hall was open to the roof, with cross-beams,
  and that the stable was attached to it, between it and the garden.</p>

  <p>3590. <i>sinne</i>, i.&nbsp;e. venial sin; see I. 859, 904, 920.</p>

  <p>3598. Evidently a common proverb.</p>

  <p>3616. It is obvious that the first foot is defective.</p>

  <p>3624. <i>His owne hand</i>, with his own hand. Tyrwhitt points out the
  same idiom in Gower, ed. Pauli, ii. 83:&mdash;</p>

  <p>3625. <i>ronges</i>, rungs, rounds, steps; <i>stalkes</i>, upright
  pieces. To <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>[108]</span>climb by the rungs and the stalks means to
  employ the hands as well as the feet. A rung was also called a
  <i>stayre</i> (stair); and <i>stalke</i> is the diminutive of
  <i>stele</i>, a handle, which was another name for the upright part of a
  ladder. In Allit. Poems, ed. Morris, C. 513, the author complains that
  some people cannot tell the difference between a <i>stele</i> and a
  <i>stayre</i>; and, in fact, the Glossary does not point it out. In the
  Ancren Riwle, p. 354, we find mention of the two ladder-<i>stales</i>
  that are upright to the heaven, between which <i>stales</i> the
  <i>tinds</i> (or rungs) are fastened. This makes the sense perfectly
  clear.</p>

  <p>3637. <i>a furlong-way</i>, a few minutes; exactly, two minutes and a
  half, at the rate of three miles an hour.</p>

  <p>3638. 'Now say a Paternoster, and keep silence.' Accordingly, the
  carpenter 'says his devotion.' '<i>Clom!</i>' is a word imposing silence,
  like 'mum!' So in the Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 266, we find: 'Yef ye me
  wylleth y-here, habbeth amang you <i>clom</i> and reste'; i.&nbsp;e. if you
  wish to hear me, keep among you silence and rest.</p>

  <p>3645. <i>corfew-tyme</i>, probably 8 <span class="sm">P.M.</span> The
  original time for ringing the curfew-bell, as a signal for putting out
  fires and lights, was eight o'clock. The custom has been kept up in some
  places till the present day; the hour for it is sometimes 8 <span
  class="sm">P.M.</span>, and sometimes 9 <span class="sm">P.M.</span> In
  olden times, mention is usually made of the former of these hours; see
  Brand, Pop. Antiq. ii. 220; Prompt. Parv. p. 110. People invariably went
  to bed very early; see l. 3633.</p>

  <p>3655. The service of <i>lauds</i> followed that of <i>nocturns</i>;
  the latter originally began at midnight, but usually somewhat later. The
  time indicated seems to have been just before daybreak. 'These nocturns
  should begin at such a time as to be ended just as morning's twilight
  broke, so that the next of her services, the <i>lauds</i>, or
  <i>matutinae laudes</i>, might come on immediately after.'&mdash;Rock,
  Church of our Fathers, iii. 2. 6. From l. 3731, we learn, however, that
  the night was still 'as dark as pitch.' Perhaps the time was between two
  and three o'clock, as Wright suggests.</p>

  <p>3668. <i>the grange</i>, lit. granary; but the term was applied to a
  farm-house and granary on an estate belonging to a feudal manor or (as
  here) to a religious house. As the estate often lay at some distance from
  the abbey, it might be necessary for the carpenter, who went to cut down
  trees, to stay at the grange for the night. Cf. note to P. Pl. C. xx. 71;
  and Prompt. Parv. (s. v. <i>grawnge</i>).</p>

  <p>3675. <i>at cockkes crowe</i>; cf. l. 3687. The expression in l. 3674
  must refer to Monday: the 'cock-crow' refers to Tuesday morning, when it
  was still pitch-dark (l. 3731). The time denoted by the 'first cock-crow'
  is very vague; see the Chapter on Cock-crowing in Brand's Pop.
  Antiquities. The 'second cock-crow' seems to be about 3 <span
  class="sm">A.M.</span>, as in Romeo and Juliet, iv. 4. 4; and the 'first
  cock-crow,' shortly after midnight, as in K. Lear, iii. 4. 121, 1 Hen.
  IV. ii. 1. 20. An early mention of the first cock occurs in Ypomedon,
  783, in Weber's Met. Romances, ii. 309:&mdash;'And at the fryst cokke
  roos he.' The clearest <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>[109]</span>statement is in Tusser's Husbandrie, sect.
  74 (E. D. S. p. 165), where he says that cocks crow 'At midnight, at
  three, and an hower ere day,' which he afterwards explains by 'past
  five.'</p>

  <p>3682. On 'itching omens,' see Miss Burne's <i>Shropshire
  Folk-Lore</i>, p. 269. 'If your right hand itches, you will receive
  money; ... if your nose itches, you will be kissed, cursed, or
  vexed.'</p>

  <p>3684. Cf. 'If [in a dream] you see many loaves, it portends joy'; A.
  S. Leechdoms, iii. 215.</p>

  <p>3689. <i>at point-devys</i>, with all exactness, precisely, very
  neatly; cf. As You Like It, iii. 2. 401. O.&nbsp;F. <i>devis</i>, 'ordre,
  beauté; <i>a devis</i>, <i>par devis</i>, en bel ordre, d'une manière
  bien ordonnée, à gré, à souhait'; Godefroy. See F. 560; Rom. of the Rose,
  1215.</p>

  <p>3690. <i>greyn</i>, evidently some sweet or aromatic seed or spice;
  apparently cardamoms, otherwise called <i>grains of Paradise</i> (New E.
  Dict.) '<i>Greynys</i>, spyce, <i>Granum Paradisi</i>'; Prompt. Parv.;
  see Way's note. Cf. Rom. of the Rose, 1369, and the note (vol. i. p.
  428).</p>

  <p>3692. <i>trewe-love</i>, (probably) a leaf of herb-paris; in the
  efficacy of which he had some superstitious belief. <i>True-love</i> is
  sometimes used as an abbreviation of <i>true-love knot</i>, as in the
  last stanza of the Court of Love; and such is the case here. True-love
  knots were of various shapes; see pictures of four such in Ogilvie's
  Dictionary. Some had four loops, which gave rise to the name
  <i>true-love</i> as applied to herb-paris. Gerarde's Herball, 1597, p.
  328, thus describes herb-paris (<i>Paris quadrifolia</i>):&mdash;At the
  top of the stalk 'come foorth fower leaves directly set one against
  another, in manner of a Burgonnion crosse or a true love knot; for which
  cause among the auncients it hath beene called herbe <i>Truelove</i>.' It
  is still called <i>True Love's Knot</i> in Cumberland.</p>

  <p>3700. Note the rime of <i>tó me</i> with <i>cinam-ó-me</i>.</p>

  <p>3708. <i>Iakke</i>, Jack, here an epithet of a fool, like
  <i>Iankin</i> (B. 1172); and see note to B. 4000. Cf. E. <i>zany</i>.</p>

  <p>3709. 'It wilt not be (a case of) come-kiss-me.' Chaucer has
  <i>ba</i>, to kiss, D. 433; and <i>come-ba-me</i>, i.&nbsp;e. come kiss me, is
  here used as a phrase; so that the line simply means 'you certainly will
  not get a kiss!' Observe the rime with <i>bla-me</i>. <i>Bas</i> also
  meant to kiss, and Skelton uses the words together (ed. Dyce, i.
  22):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'With <i>ba, ba, ba</i>, and <i>bas, bas, bas</i>,</p>
      <p>She cheryshed hym, both cheke and chyn';</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. with repeated kisses on cheek and chin. So again (i. 127) we
  find: '<i>bas me</i>, buttyng, praty Cys!' And so again (ii. 6): '<i>bas
  me</i>, swete Parrot, <i>bas me</i>, swete, swete!' Further illustration
  is afforded by Burton's Anat. of Melancholy, pt. 3. sec. 2. mem. 4.
  subsec. 1: 'Yea, many times, this love will make old men and women ...
  dance, <i>come-kiss-me-now</i>, mask, and mum.' This complete explanation
  of an old <i>crux</i> was first given by Mr. Ellis, in 1870, in his Early
  Eng. <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>[110]</span>Pronunciation, p. 715, who notes that the
  reading <i>com ba me</i> is fairly well supported; see his Critical Note.
  Several MSS. turn it into <i>compame</i>, which is clearly due to the
  influence of the familiar word <i>companye</i>, which repeatedly ends a
  line in Chaucer. Mr. Ellis well remarks&mdash;'<i>Com ba me!</i> was
  probably the name of a song, like ... the modern "Kiss me quick, and go,
  my love." It is also probable that Absolon's speech contained allusions
  to it, and that it was very well known at the time.'</p>

  <p>The curious part of the story is that, in 1889, I adopted the same
  reading independently, and for precisely similar reasons. But Mr. Ellis
  was before me, by nineteen years. See l. 3716 below.</p>

  <p>The following MSS. (says Mr. Ellis) read <i>combame</i>; viz. Harl.
  7335&mdash;Camb. Univ. Library, Ii. 3. 26&mdash;Trin. Coll. Camb. R. 3.
  3&mdash;Rawl. MS. Poet. 141. Bodl. 414 has <i>cum bame</i>; whilst Rawl.
  Misc. 1133 and Laud 739 have <i>come ba me</i>.</p>

  <p>3713. Lit. 'in the way to twenty devils'; hence, in the name of twenty
  devils. 'In the twenty deuyll way, <i>Au nom du grant diable</i>';
  Palsgrave (1852), p. 838. See ll. 3134, 4257.</p>

  <p>3721-2. These two lines are in E. only; Tyrwhitt omits them. But the
  old black-letter editions retain them.</p>

  <p>3725. Cf. 'For who-so kissing may attayne'; Rom. Rose, 3677; and Ovid,
  Ars Amatoria, i. 669.</p>

  <p>3726. <i>thyn ore</i>, thy favour, thy grace; the words 'grant me'
  being understood. It is not uncommon.</p>

  <p>3728. <i>com of</i>, i.&nbsp;e. be quick; like <i>Have do</i>, have done!
  We now say 'come on!' But strictly, <i>come on</i> means 'begin,' and
  <i>come off</i> means 'make an end.'</p>

  <p>3751. 'If it be not so that, rather than possess all this town, I
  would like to be avenged.'</p>

  <p>3770. <i>viritoot</i> must be accepted as the reading; the reading
  <i>verytrot</i> in MS. Hl. gives a false rime, as the <i>oo</i> in
  <i>woot</i> is long. The meaning is unknown; but the context requires the
  sense of 'upon the move,' or 'astir.' My guess is that <i>viri-</i> is
  from F. <i>virer</i>, to turn (cf. E. <i>virelay</i>), and that
  <i>toot</i> represents O.&nbsp;F. <i>tot</i> (L. <i>totum</i>, F.
  <i>tout</i>), all; so that <i>viritoot</i> may mean 'turn-all.' Cotgrave
  gives <i>virevoulte</i>, 'a veere, whirle a round gamball, friske, or
  turne,' like the Portuguese <i>viravolta</i>. The form <i>verytrot</i>
  (very trot) is clearly due to an attempt to make sense. MS. Cam. has
  <i>merytot</i>, possibly with reference to M.&nbsp;E. <i>merytoter</i>, a
  swing <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>[111]</span>(Catholicon); which is derived from
  <i>mery</i>, merry, and <i>toteren</i>, to totter, oscillate. In the
  North of England, a swing is still called a <i>merry-trotter</i>
  (corruption of <i>merry-totter</i>), as noted by Halliwell, who remarks
  that 'the <i>meritot</i> is mentioned by Chaucer,' which is not the fact.
  Both these 'glosses' give the notion of movement, as this is obviously
  the general sense implied. Whatever the reading may be, we can see the
  sense, viz. 'some gay girl (euphemism for light woman) has brought you
  thus so early astir'; and Gervase accordingly goes on to say, 'you know
  what I mean.'</p>

  <p>Ed. 1561 has <i>berytote</i>, a misprint for <i>verytote</i>.</p>

  <p>3771. Here as elsewhere, <i>së-ynt</i> is dissyllabic; several MSS.
  have <i>seinte</i>, but this can hardly be right. For <i>Note</i>, MSS.
  Pt. Hl. have <i>Noet</i>, meaning <i>St. Neot</i>, whose day is Oct. 28,
  and whose name remains in St. Neot's, in Cornwall, and St. Neot's, in
  Huntingdonshire. He died about 877; see Wright's Biogr. Brit. Litt.,
  A.&nbsp;S. Period, p. 381. The spelling <i>Note</i> is remarkable, as the mod.
  E. name (pronounced as <i>Neet</i>, riming with <i>feet</i>) suggests the
  A.&nbsp;S. form <i>N&#x113;ot</i>, and M.&nbsp;E. <i>Neet</i>.</p>

  <p>3774. A proverbial phrase. Tyrwhitt quotes from Froissart, v. iv. p.
  92, ed. 1574; 'Il aura en bref temps autres estoupes en sa quenoille.' To
  'have tow on one's distaff' is to have a task in hand. 'Towe on my dystaf
  have I for to spynne'; Hoccleve, De Regimine Principum, p. 45.</p>

  <p>3777. <i>As lene</i>, pray lend; see note to E. 7.</p>

  <p>3782. MS. Hl. has <i>fo</i>, which is silently altered to <i>fote</i>
  by Bell and Wright. Tyrwhitt also has <i>fote</i>, which he found in the
  black-letter editions. The reading <i>foo</i> is probably quite right,
  and is an intentional substitution for <i>foot</i>. It is notorious that
  oaths were constantly made unmeaning, to avoid a too open profanity. In
  Chaucer, we have <i>cokkes bones</i>, H. 9, I. 29, and <i>Corpus
  bones</i>, C. 314. Another corruption of a like oath is <i>'s foot</i>,
  Shak. Troil. ii. 3. 6, which is docked at the other end. It is poor work
  altering MSS. so as to destroy evidence. <i>Cristes foo</i> might mean
  'the devil'; but this is unlikely.</p>

  <p>3785. <i>stele</i>, handle; i.&nbsp;e. by the cold end, which served as a
  handle. See note to D. 949. <i>st&#x113;le</i>, i.&nbsp;e. steel, would give a
  false rime.</p>

  <p>3811. Tyrwhitt inserted <i>al</i> before <i>aboute</i> in his text,
  but withdrew it in his notes. The A.&nbsp;S. has <i>hand-br&#x1E3;d</i>, but
  the M.&nbsp;E. <i>hand-e-brede</i> had at least three syllables, if not four.
  This is shewn by MS. spellings and by the metre, and still more clearly
  by Wyclif's Bible, which has: 'a spanne, that is, an <i>handibreede</i>,'
  Ezek. xl. 5 (later version). It may have been formed by analogy with
  M.&nbsp;E. <i>handiwerk</i> (A. S. <i>hand-geweorc</i>) and <i>handewrit</i>
  (A. S. <i>hand-gewrit</i>). But the form is <i>handbrede</i> in Palladius
  on Husbandry, p. 80, l. 536.</p>

  <p>3818. <i>Nowelis flood</i> is the mistake of the illiterate carpenter
  for <i>Noes flood</i>; see it again in l. 3834, where he is laughed at
  for having used the expression in his previous talks with the clerk and
  his wife. It is on a par with his <i>astromye</i> (note to l. 3451). He
  was less familiar with the <i>Noe</i> of the Bible than with the
  <i>Nowel</i> of the <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span>carol-singers at Christmas; see F. 1255.
  The editors carefully 'correct' the poet. In l. 3834, <i>Nowélis</i>
  helps the scansion, whilst <i>Noes</i> spoils the line, which has to be
  'amended.' The readings are: E. Hn. <i>as in the text</i>; Cm. Pt. Ln.
  the Nowels flood; Pt. the Noes flood; Hl. He was agast and feerd of Noes
  flood. Tyrwhitt actually reads; He was agast-e so of Noes flood;
  regardless of the fact that <i>agast</i> has no final <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i>. The carpenter's mistake is the more pardonable
  when we notice that <i>Noë</i> was sometimes used, instead of
  <i>Noël</i>, to mean 'Christmas.' For an example, see the Poètes de
  Champagne, Reims, 1851, p. 146.</p>

  <p>3821. This singular expression is from the French. Tyrwhitt
  cites:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Ainc tant come il mist a descendre,</p>
      <p>Ne trouva point de pain a vendre,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. he found no bread to sell in his descent. His reference is to
  the Fabliaux, t. ii. p. 282; Wright refers, for the same, to the fabliau
  of Aloul, in Barbazan, l. 591. I suppose the sense is, 'he never stopped,
  as if to transact business.'</p>

  <p>3822. E. Hn. celle; <i>rest</i> selle. The word <i>celle</i> might
  mean 'chamber.' There was an approach to the roof, which they had reached
  by help of a ladder; and the three tubs were hung among the balks which
  formed the roof of the principal sitting-room below. But it is difficult
  to see how the word <i>celle</i> could be applied to the chief room in
  the house. Tyrwhitt explains <i>selle</i> as 'door-sill or threshold';
  but we must bear in mind that the <i>usual</i> M.&nbsp;E. form of <i>sill</i>
  was either <i>sille</i> or <i>sulle</i>, from A.&nbsp;S. <i>syll</i>. The
  spelling with <i>s</i> proves nothing, since Chaucer undoubtedly means
  'cell' in A. 1376, where Cm. Hl. have <i>selle</i>, and in B. 3162, where
  three MSS. (Cp. Pt. Ln.) all read <i>selle</i> again. Why the carpenter
  should have arrived at the door-sill, I do not know.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, upon further thoughts, I accept Tyrwhitt's view, with
  some modification. We find that Chaucer actually uses Kentish forms (with
  <i>e</i> for A.&nbsp;S. <i>y</i>) elsewhere, for the sake of a rime. A clear
  case is that of <i>fulfelle</i>, in Troil. iii. 510. This justifies the
  dat. form <i>selle</i> (A. S. <i>sylle</i>). But we must take
  <i>selle</i> to mean 'flooring' or 'boarding,' and <i>floor</i> to mean
  the ground beneath it; just as we find, in Widegren's Swedish Dictionary,
  that <i>syll</i> means 'the timber next the ground.' I would therefore
  read <i>selle</i>, with the sense of 'flooring'; and I explain
  <i>floor</i> by 'flat earth.' In the allit. Morte Arthure, 3249,
  <i>flores</i> signifies 'plains.' In Gawayn and the Grene Knyght, 55,
  <i>sille</i> means 'floor.'</p>

  <p>3841. Observe the form <i>cape</i>, as a variant of <i>gape</i>, both
  here and in l. 3444 (see footnotes); and in Troil. v. 1133.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Reve's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>3855. For <i>laughen</i>, Tyrwhitt has <i>laughed</i>, and in l. 3858
  has the extraordinary form <i>lought</i>, but he corrects the former of
  these in his <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>[113]</span>Notes. The verb was originally strong; see
  examples in Stratmann, s. v. <i>hlahhen</i>.</p>

  <p>3857. Repeated, nearly, in F. 202; see note.</p>

  <p>3864. <i>so theek</i>, for <i>so thee ik</i>, so may I thrive, as I
  hope to thrive. The Reve came from Norfolk, and Chaucer makes him use the
  Northern <i>ik</i> for <i>I</i> in this expression, and again in l. 3867
  (in the phrase <i>ik am</i>), and in l. 3888 (in the phrase <i>ik
  have</i>), but not elsewhere; whence it would seem that <i>ik</i> for
  <i>I</i> was then dying out in Norfolk; it has now died out even in the
  North. Both the Host and the Canon's Yeoman use the Southern form <i>so
  theech</i>; see C. 947, G. 929. Cf. <i>so the ik</i>, P. Pl., B. v.
  228.</p>

  <p>3865. To <i>blear</i> (lit. to dim) <i>one's eye</i> was to delude,
  hoodwink, or cheat a man. So also <i>blered is thyn yë</i>, H. 252.</p>

  <p>3868. <i>gras-time</i>, the time when a horse feeds himself in the
  fields. <i>My fodder is now forage</i>, my food is now such as is
  provided for me; I am like a horse in winter, whose food is hay in a
  stable. Thynne animadverts upon this passage (Animadversions, p. 39), and
  says that <i>forage</i> means 'such harde and olde prouisione as ys made
  for horses and cattle in winter.' He remarks, justly, that <i>forage</i>
  is but loosely used in Sir Thopas, B. 1973.</p>

  <p>3869. I take this to mean&mdash;'my old years write (mark upon me)
  this white head,' i.&nbsp;e. turn me grey.</p>

  <p>3870. 'My heart is as old (lit. mouldy) as my hairs are.'
  <i>Mouled</i> is the old pp. out of which we have made the mod. E.
  <i>mould-y</i>, adding <i><span class="nw">-y</span></i> by confusion
  with the adj. formed from <i>mould</i>, the ground. It is fully explained
  in the Addenda to my Etym. Dict. 2nd ed. p. 818; and the verb
  <i>moulen</i>, to grow mouldy, occurs in B. 32.</p>

  <p>3871. 'Unless I grow like a medlar, which gets worse all the while,
  till it be quite rotten, when laid up in a heap of rubbish or straw.'</p>

  <p>3876. <i>hoppen</i>, dance; alluding to Luke vii. 32, where Wyclif
  has: 'we han sungun to you with pipis, and ye han not daunsid.'</p>

  <p>3877. <i>nayl</i>, a hindrance; like a nail that holds a box from
  being opened, or that catches a man's clothes, and holds him back.</p>

  <p>3878. 'E quegli che contro alla mia età parlando vanno, mostra mal che
  conoscano che, perchè il porro abbia il capo blanco, che la coda sia
  verde'; and, as for those that go speaking about my age, it shews that
  they ill understand how, although the leek has a white head, its tail (or
  blade) is green; Boccaccio, Decamerone; introduction to the Fourth Day.
  So also in Northward Ho, by Dekker and Webster, Act iv. sc. 1: 'garlic
  has a white head and a green stalk'; where Dyce remarks that it occurs
  again in The Honest Lawyer, 1616, sig. G 2. Cf. P. Plowman, B. xiii.
  352.</p>

  <p>3882. For <i>olde</i>, T. has <i>cold</i>, I cannot guess why:
  smouldering ashes are more likely to be hot. <i>Old ashes</i> mean ashes
  left after a fire has died down, in which, if raked together, fire can be
  long preserved. 'Still, in our old ashes, is fire collected.' See the
  parallel passage in Troilus, ii. 538.</p>

  <p>In Soliman and Persida (Dodsley's Old Plays, ed. Hazlitt, v. 339) we
  find:&mdash;</p>

  <p>We are reminded of line 92 in Gray's Elegy:&mdash;'Ev'n in our ashes

  not of Chaucer, but of Sonnet 169 (170) of Petrarch:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p><i>y-reke</i>, raked or heaped together, collected. Not explained by
  Wright or Morris; Tyrwhitt explains it by 'smoking,' and takes it to be a
  <i>present</i> participle, which is impossible. It is the pt. t. of the
  scarce strong verb <i>reken</i>, pt. t. <i>rak</i>, pp. <i>y-reken</i>,
  <i>y-reke</i>, of which the primary notion was to 'gather together.' It
  occurs, just once, in Gothic, in the translation of Romans, xii. 20:
  'haurja funins <i>rikis</i> ana haubith is,' i.&nbsp;e. coals of fire shalt
  thou heap together on his head. It is the very verb from which the sb.
  <i>rake</i> is derived. See <i>Rake</i> in my Etym. Dict., and the G.
  <i>Rechen</i> in Kluge. The notion is taken from the heaping together of
  smouldering ashes to preserve the fire within. Lydgate copies this image
  in his Siege of Troye, ed. 1555, fol. B 4:&mdash;</p>

  <p>3895. <i>chimbe.</i> 'The prominency of the staves beyond the head of
  the barrel. The imagery is very exact and beautiful'; Tyrwhitt.
  '<i>Chime</i> (pronounced <i>choim</i>), sb. a stave of a cask, barrel,
  &amp;c.'; Leicestershire Glossary (E. D. S.) Urry gives '<i>Chimbe</i>,
  the Rim of a Cooper's Vessel on the outside of the Head. The ends of the
  Staves from the Grooves outward are called the <i>Chimes</i>.' Hexham's
  Du. Dict. has: '<i>Kimen</i>, <i>Kimmen</i>, the Brimmes of a tubb or a
  barrill.' Sewel's Du. Dict. has: '<i>Kim</i>, the brim of a barrel.' The
  Bremen <i>Kimm</i> signifies not only the rim of a barrel, but the edge
  of the horizon; cf. Dan. <i>Kiming</i>, <i>Kimming</i>, the horizon. See
  further in New E. Dict. <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>[115]</span></p>

  <p>3901-2. <i>what amounteth</i>, to what amounts. <i>What shul</i>, why
  must.</p>

  <p>3904. Tyrwhitt refers us to <i>Ex sutore medicus</i>, Phædrus, lib. i.
  fab. 14; and to <i>ex sutore nauclerus</i>, alluded to by Pynson the
  printer, at the end of his edition of Littleton's Tenures, 1525 (Ames, p.
  488).</p>

  <p>3906. <i>Depeford</i> (lit. deep ford), Deptford; just beyond which is
  <i>Grenewich</i>, Greenwich. Thus the pilgrims had not advanced very far,
  considering that the Knight and Miller had both told a tale. They had
  made an early start, and it was now 'half-way prime.' 'Deptford,' says
  Dr. Furnivall, 'is 3 miles down the road [or a little more, it depends
  upon whence we reckon]; and, as only the Reeve's Tale and the incomplete
  Cook's Tale follow in Group A, we must suppose that Chaucer meant to
  insert here [at the end of Group A] the Tales of some, at least, of the
  Five City-Mechanics and the Ploughman ... in order to bring his party to
  their first night's resting-place, Dartford, 15 miles from London'; Temp.
  Preface, p. 19. 'The deep ford,' I may remark, must have been the one
  through the Ravensbourn. Deptford and Greenwich (where, probably, Chaucer
  was then residing) lay off the Old Kent Road, on the left; hence the host
  points them out.</p>

  <p><i>half-way prime.</i> That is, half-past seven o'clock; taking
  <i>prime</i> to mean the first quarter of the day, or the period from 6
  to 9 <span class="sm">A.M.</span> It was also used to denote the
  <i>end</i> of that period, or 9 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>, as in B.
  4387, where the meaning is certain. In my Preface to Chaucer's Astrolabe,
  (E. E. T. S.), I said: 'What <i>prime</i> means in all cases, I do not
  pretend to say. It is a most difficult word, and I think was used
  loosely. It might mean the beginning or end of a period, and the period
  might be an hour, or a quarter of a day. I think it was to obviate
  ambiguity that the end of the period was sometimes expressed by <i>high
  prime</i>, or <i>passed prime</i>, or <i>prime large</i>; we also find
  such expressions as <i>half prime</i>, <i>halfway prime</i>, or <i>not
  fully prime</i>, which indicate a somewhat long period. For further
  remarks, see Mr. Brae's Essay on Chaucer's Prime, in his edition of the
  Astrolabe, p. 90. I add some references for the word <i>prime</i>, which
  may be useful. We find <i>prime</i> in Kn. Ta. 1331 (A. 2189); Mill. Ta.
  368 (A. 3554); March. Ta. 613 (E. 1857); Pard. Ta. 200 (C. 662); Ship.
  Ta. 206 (B. 1396); Squi. Ta. 65 (F. 73); <i>fully prime</i>, Sir Topas,
  114 (B. 2015); <i>halfway prime</i>, Reve's Prol. 52 (A. 3906); <i>passed
  prime</i>, Ship. Ta. 88 (B. 1278), Fre. Ta. 178 (D. 1476); <i>prime
  large</i>, Squi. Ta. ii. 14 (F. 360). See also <i>prime</i> in Troilus,
  ii. 992, v. 15; <i>passed prime</i>, ii. 1095 (in the same); <i>an houre
  after the prime</i>, ii. 1557.' Cf. notes to F. 73, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>3911. <i>somdel</i>, in some degree. <i>sette his howve</i>, the same
  as <i>set his cappe</i>, i.&nbsp;e. make him look foolish; see notes to A.
  586, 3143. To come behind a man, and alter the look of his head-gear, was
  no doubt a common trick; now that caps are moveable, the perennial joy of
  the street-boy is to run off with another boy's cap. <!-- Page 116

  <p>3912. 'For it is allowable to repel (shove off) force by force.' The
  Ellesmere MS. has here the sidenote&mdash;'vim vi repellere.'</p>

  <p>3919. <i>stalke</i>, (here) a bit of stick; Lat. <i>festuca</i>.
  <i>balke</i>, a beam; Lat. <i>trabs</i>. See the Vulgate version of Matt.
  vii. 3.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Reves Tale.</b></p>

  <p>The origin of this Tale was a French Fabliau, like one that was first
  pointed out by Mr. T. Wright, and printed in his Anecdota Literaria, p.
  15. Another similar one is printed in Méon's edition of Barbazan's
  Fabliaux, iii. 239 (Paris, 1808). Both were reprinted for the Chaucer
  Society, in Originals and Analogues, &amp;c., p. 87. See further in vol.
  iii. p. 397.</p>

  <p>3921. <i>Trumpington.</i> The modern mill, beside the bridge over the
  Granta, between the villages of Trumpington and Grantchester, is familiar
  to all Cambridge men; but this mill and bridge are both comparatively
  modern, being placed upon an artificial channel. The old 'bridge' is that
  over the old river-bed, somewhat nearer Trumpington; the 'brook' is this
  old course of the Granta, which is hereabouts very narrow and circuitous;
  and the mill stood a quarter of a mile above the bridge, at the spot
  marked 'Old Mills' on the ordnance-map, though better known as 'Byron's
  pool,' which is the old mill-pool. The fen mentioned in l. 4065 is
  probably the field between the Old Mills and the road, which must
  formerly have been fen-land; though Lingay Fen may be meant, which covers
  the space between Bourne Brook (flowing into the Granta at the Old Mills)
  and the Cambridge and Bedford Railway. We like to think that Chaucer saw
  the spot himself; but he certainly seems to have thought that Trumpington
  was somewhat further from Cambridge than it really is, as he actually
  makes the clerks to have been benighted there; and he might easily have
  learnt some local particulars from his wife's friend, Lady Blaunche de
  Trumpington, or from Sir Roger himself. In any case, it is interesting to
  find him thus boldly assigning a known locality to a mill which he had
  found in a French fabliau.</p>

  <p>3927. <i>Pypen</i>, play the bag-pipe; see A. 565. The Reeve is
  clearly trying to make his description suit the Miller in the company,
  whom it is his express object to tease. Hence he says he could <i>wrestle
  well</i> (cf. A. 548) and could play the bag-pipe.</p>

  <p><i>nettes bete</i>, mend nets; he knew how to net.</p>

  <p>3928. <i>turne coppes</i>, turn cups, make wooden cups in a
  turning-lathe; not a very difficult operation. It is curious that
  Tyrwhitt gave up trying to explain this simple phrase. In Riley's
  Memorials of London, p. 666, we find that, in 1418, when the English were
  besieging Rouen, it was enacted that 'the turners should have 4<i>s.</i>
  for every hundred of 2,500 cups, in all 100<i>s.</i>': so that a wooden
  cup could be turned at the cost of a halfpenny. <!-- Page 117 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[117]</span></p>

  <p>3929. Printed <i>pavade</i> by Tyrwhitt, <i>pauade</i> by Thynne (ed.
  1532), but <i>panade</i> in Wright. Levins' Manipulus Vocabulorum (1570)
  has: '<span class="sc">A pauade</span>, <i>pugio</i>'; but this is
  probably copied from Thynne. The exact form is not found in O.&nbsp;F., but
  Godefroy's O.&nbsp;F. Dict. gives: '<i>Penart</i>, <i>pennart</i>,
  <i>penard</i>, <i>panart</i>, <i>pannart</i>, coutelas, espèce de grand
  couteau à deux tranchants ou taillants, sorte de poignard'; with seven
  examples, one of which shows that it could be hung at the belt: 'Un grant
  <i>pennart</i> qu'il avoit pendu a sa sainture.' Ducange gives the Low
  Lat. form <i>penardus</i>, and wrongly connects it with F.
  <i>poignard</i>, from which it is clearly distinct; but he also gives the
  form <i>pennatum</i> with the sense of 'pruning-knife,' and Torriano
  gives an Ital. <i>pennato</i> with the same sense. Cf. Lat.
  <i>bi-pennis</i>. It was a two-edged cutlass, worn in addition to his
  sword; and see below. It is also printed <i>pauade</i> in Lydgate's Siege
  of Troy, ed. 1555, fol. N 5, back.</p>

  <p>3931. <i>popper</i>, thruster, i.&nbsp;e. dagger; from the verb <i>pop</i>,
  to thrust in; cf. <i>poke</i>. <i>Ioly</i> probably means 'neat' or
  'small.' This was the Miller's third weapon of offence, of which he had
  three sizes, viz. a sword, a cutlass, and a little dagger like a
  <i>misericorde</i>, used for piercing between the joints of armour. No
  wonder that no one durst touch him 'for peril.' The <i>poppere</i>
  answers to the <i>boydekin</i> of l. 3960, q.v. And besides these, he
  carried a knife. 'Poppe, to stryke'; Cathol. Angl. p. 286.</p>

  <p>3933. <i>thwitel</i>, knife; from A.S. <i>thw&#x12B;tan</i>, to cut;
  now ill-spelt <i>whittle</i>. The portraits of Chaucer show a knife
  hanging from his breast; accordingly, in Greene's Description of Chaucer,
  we find this line: 'A whittle by his belt he bare'; see Greene's Works,
  ed. Dyce, 1883, p. 320. Note that Sheffield was already celebrated for
  its cutlery; so in the Witch of Edmonton, Act ii. sc. 2, Somerton speaks
  of 'the new pair of <i>Sheffield knives</i>.'</p>

  <p>3934. <i>camuse</i> (Hl. <i>camois</i>), low and concave; cf. l. 3974
  below. F. <i>camus</i>, 'flat-nosed'; Cotgrave. Ital. <i>camuso</i>, 'one
  with a flat nose'; Florio. See <i>Camois</i> in the New E. Dict., where
  it is thus explained: 'Of the nose: low and concave. Of persons:
  pug-nosed.' To the examples there given, add the following from Holland's
  tr. of Pliny, i. 229; 'As for the male goats, they are held for the best
  which are most <i>camoise</i> or snout-nosed.' Hexham's Du. Dict., s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>Neuse</i>, has the curious entry: '<i>een Camuys ende opwaerts gaende
  Neuse</i> [lit. a camus and upwards-going Nose], Camell-nosed.'</p>

  <p>3936. <i>market-beter</i>, a frequenter of markets, who swaggered
  about, and was apt to be quarrelsome and in the way of others. See
  Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, pp. 511, 520; and cf. F. <i>battre le
  pavé</i>, 'aller et venir sans but, sans occupation'; Littré. And cf. E.
  'policeman's <i>beat</i>.' Cotgrave has: '<i>Bateur de pavez</i>, a
  pavement-beater; ... one that walks much abroad, and riots it wheresoever
  he walks.' The following passage from the Complaint of the Ploughman (in
  Wright's Polit. Poems, i. 330) makes it clear&mdash; <!-- Page 118

  trisyllable. <i>Deynous</i> was his regular epithet.</p>

  <p>3943. This statement, that the parson of the town was her father, has
  caused surprise. In Bell's Chaucer, the theory is started that the priest
  had been a widower before he took orders, which no one can be expected to
  believe; it is too subtle. It is clear that she was an illegitimate
  daughter; this is why her father paid money to get her married to a
  miller, and why she thought ladies ought to spare her (and not avoid
  her), because it was an honour to have a priest for a father, and because
  she had learnt so much good-breeding in a nunnery. The case is only too
  clear; cf. note to l. 3963.</p>

  <p>3953. <i>tipet</i>, not here a cape, but the long pendant from the
  hood at one time fashionable, which Simkin wound round his head, in order
  to get it out of the way. See <i>Tippett</i> in Fairholt's Costume in
  England; Glossary. Cf. notes to A. 233, 682.</p>

  <p>3954. So also the Wife of Bath had 'gay scarlet <i>gytes</i>'; D. 559.
  Spelt <i>gide</i> in MS. Ln., and <i>gyde</i> in Blind Harry's
  <i>Wallace</i>, i. 214: 'In-till a <i>gyde</i> of gudly ganand greyne,'
  where it is used of a gay dress worn by Wallace. It occurs also twice in
  Golagros and Gawain, used of the gay dress of a woman; see Jamieson.
  Nares shews that <i>gite</i> is used once by Fairfax, and thrice by
  Gascoigne. The sense is usually dubious; it may mean 'robe,' or, in some
  places, 'head-dress.' The <i>g</i> was certainly hard, and the word is of
  F. origin. Godefroy gives '<i>guite</i>, chapeau'; and Roquefort has
  '<i>wite</i>, voile.' The F. Gloss. appended to Ducange gives the word
  <i>witart</i> as applied to a man, and <i>witarde</i> as applied to a
  woman. Cf. O.&nbsp;F. <i>wiart</i>, which Roquefort explains as a woman's
  veil, whilst Godefroy explains <i>guiart</i> as a dress or vestment. The
  form of the word suggests a Teutonic origin; perhaps from O. H. G.
  <i>wît</i>, wide, ample, which would explain its use to denote a veil or
  a robe indifferently. Ducange suggests a derivation from Lat.
  <i>uitta</i>, which is also possible.</p>

  <p>3956. <i>dame</i>, lady; see A. 376.</p>

  <p>3959. <i>wold-e</i>, wished, seems to be dissyllabic; see note to l.
  3941. <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>3960. <i>boydekin</i>, dagger, as in B. 3892, q. v. Cf. note to l.
  3931.</p>

  <p>3962. 'At any rate, they would that their wives should think so.'
  <i>Wenden</i>, pt. pl. subj. of <i>wenen</i>.</p>

  <p>3963. <i>smoterlich</i>, besmutched; cf. <i>bismotered</i> in A. 76.
  Tyrwhitt says: 'it means, I suppose, smutty, dirty; but the whole passage
  is obscure.' Rather, it is perfectly clear when the allusion is
  perceived. The allusion is to the smutch upon her reputation, on account
  of her illegitimacy. This explains also the use of <i>somdel</i>;
  'because she was, in some measure, of indifferent reputation, she was
  always on her dignity, and ready to take offence'; which is true to human
  nature. Thus the whole context is illuminated at once.</p>

  <p>3964. <i>digne</i>, full of dignity, and therefore (as Chaucer says,
  with exquisite satire) like (foul) water in a ditch, which keeps every
  one at a proper distance. However, the satire is not Chaucer's own, but
  due to a popular proverbial jest, which occurs again in The Ploughman's
  Crede, l. 375, where the Dominican friars are thus described:&mdash;</p>

  because that college was of early foundation, and was called a 'hall.'
  But a happy find by Mr. Riley tells us better, and sets the question at
  rest. In the First Report of the Historical MSS. Commission, p. 84, Mr.
  Riley gives several extracts from the Bursar's Books of King's <!-- Page
  120 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[120]</span>Hall, in
  which the word <i>solarium</i> repeatedly occurs, shewing that this Hall
  possessed numerous <i>solaria</i>, or sun-chambers, used as
  dwelling-rooms, apparently by the fellows. They were probably fitted with
  bay-windows. This leaves little doubt that <i>Soler-Hall</i> was another
  name for <i>King's Hall</i>, founded in 1337 by Edward III, and now
  merged in Trinity College. It stood on the ground now occupied by the
  Great Gate, the Chapel, Bowling-green, and Master's Lodge of that
  celebrated college. On the testimony of Chaucer, we learn that the King's
  Hall, even in his time, was 'a greet collegge.' Its successor is the
  largest in England.</p>

  <p>In Wright's Hist. of Domestic Manners, pp. 83, 127, 128, it is
  explained that the early stone-built house usually had a hall on the
  ground-floor, and a <i>soler</i> above. The latter, being more protected,
  was better lighted, and was considered a place of greater security. 'In
  the thirteenth century a proverbial characteristic of an avaricious and
  inhospitable person, was to shut his hall-door and live in the
  <i>soler</i>.' It was also 'considered as the room of honour for rich
  lodgers or guests who paid well.' Udall speaks of 'the <i>solares</i>, or
  loftes of my hous'; tr. of Erasmus' Apophthegmes, <i>Aug. Cæsar</i>, §
  27.</p>

  <p>3999. <i>made fare</i>, made a to-do (as we now say).</p>

  <p>4014. <i>Strother.</i> There is now no town of this name in England,
  but the reference is probably to a place which gave its name to a
  Northumbrian family. Mr. Gollancz tells me:&mdash;'The Strother family,
  of Northumberland, famous in the fourteenth century, was a branch of the
  Strothers, of Castle Strother in Glendale, to the west of Wooler. The
  chief member of this Northumberland branch seems to have been <i>Alan de
  Strother</i> the younger, who died in 1381. (See Calendarium Inquis. post
  Mortem, 4 Ric. II, vol. iii. p. 32.) The records contain numerous
  references to him; e.&nbsp;g. "Aleyn de Struther, conestable de nostre chastel
  de Rokesburgh," <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 1366 (Rymer's F&oelig;dera,
  iii. 784); "Alanum del Strother, vicecomitem de Rokesburgh et vicecomitem
  Northumbriæ" (id. iii. 919). It is a noteworthy point that this Alan de
  Strother had a son <i>John</i>.' This definite information does away with
  the old guess, that Strother is a mistake for Langstrothdale Chase almost
  at the N.W. extremity of the W. Riding of Yorkshire, joining the far end
  of Wharfdale to Ribblesdale, and even now not very accessible, though it
  can be reached from Ribblehead station, on the Skipton and Carlisle
  Railway, or from Horton-in-Ribblesdale.</p>

  <p>I suppose that Castle Strother, mentioned above, must have been near
  Kirknewton, some 5 miles or so to the west of Wooler. The river Glen
  falls into the Till, which is a tributary of the Tweed. I find mention,
  in 1358-9, of 'Henry de Strother, of Kirknewton in Glendale'; Brand,
  Hist. of Newcastle, ii. 414, note. W. Hutchinson, in his View of
  Northumberland, 1778, i. 260, speaks of 'Kirknewton, one of the manors of
  the Barony of Wark, the ancient residence of the Strothers, now the
  property of John Strother Ker, Esq.' <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>[121]</span></p>

  <p>We may here notice some of the characteristics of the speech which
  Chaucer assigns to these two students from Northumberland.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) They use <i>a</i> for A. S. <i>&#x101;</i>, where Chaucer
  usually has <i>&#x14D;</i> (long and open). Ex. <i>na</i> (Ch.
  <i>no</i>), <i>swa</i> (<i>so</i>), <i>ham</i> (<i>hoom</i>), <i>gas</i>
  (gooth), <i>fra</i> (<i>fro</i>), <i>banes</i> (<i>bones</i>),
  <i>anes</i> (<i>ones</i>), <i>waat</i> (<i>woot</i>), <i>raa</i>
  (<i>ro</i>), <i>bathe</i> (<i>bothe</i>), <i>ga</i> (<i>go</i>),
  <i>twa</i>, (<i>two</i>), <i>wha</i> (<i>who</i>). Similarly we find
  <i>saule</i> for Ch. <i>soule</i>, soul, <i>tald</i> for <i>told</i>,
  <i>halde</i> for <i>holde</i>, <i>awen</i> for <i>owen</i>, own.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) They use <i>a</i> for A. S. short <i>a</i> before
  <i>ng</i>. Ex. <i>wanges</i>, but Ch. also has <i>wang-tooth</i>, B.
  3234; <i>sang</i> for <i>song</i> (4170), <i>lange</i> for <i>longe</i>,
  <i>wrang</i> for <i>wrong</i>.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) They use (perhaps) <i>ee</i> for <i>oo</i>; as in
  <i>geen</i> for <i>goon</i>, gone, 4078; <i>neen</i> for <i>noon</i>,
  none, 4185. This is remarkable, and, in fact, the readings vary, as
  noted. <i>Geen</i>, <i>neen</i> are in MS. E. Note also <i>pit</i> for
  <i>put</i>, 4088.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) They use the indicative sing. and pl. in <i><span
  class="nw">-es</span></i> or <i><span class="nw">-s</span></i>. Ex. 3
  pers. sing. <i>far-es</i>, <i>bo-es</i>, <i>ga-s</i>, <i>wagg-es</i>,
  <i>fall-es</i>, <i>fynd-es</i>, 4130, <i>bring-es</i>, <i>tyd-es</i>,
  4175, <i>say-s</i>, 4180. Pl. <i>werk-es</i>, 4030. So also is <i>I</i>,
  <i>I is</i>, <i>thou is</i>, 4089. In l. 4045, we find <i>are ye</i>, E.;
  <i>ar ye</i> (better), Hn.; <i>ere ye</i>, Cp. Hl.; <i>is ye</i>, Cm.
  Pt.; <i>es ye</i>, Ln. Both <i>ar</i> (<i>er</i>) and <i>is</i>
  (<i>es</i>) are found in the present tense plural in Northern works;
  <i>we is</i> occurs in Barbour's Bruce, iii. 317. It is not
  'ungrammatical,' as Tyrwhitt supposes.</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) Other grammatical peculiarities are: <i>sal</i> for
  <i>shal</i>, shall, 4087; <i>slyk</i> for <i>swiche</i>, such, 4173;
  <i>whilk</i> for <i>whiche</i>, 4171; <i>thair</i> for <i>hir</i>, their,
  4172 (which is now the standard use); <i>hethen</i> for <i>hennes</i>,
  hence, 4033; <i>til</i> for <i>to</i> (but Chaucer sometimes uses
  <i>til</i> himself, chiefly before a vowel); <i>y-mel</i> for
  <i>amonges</i>, 4171; <i>gif</i> for <i>if</i>, 4181.</p>

  <p>(<i>f</i>) Besides the use of the peculiar forms mentioned in
  (<i>e</i>), we find certain words employed which do not occur elsewhere
  in Chaucer, viz. <i>boes</i> (see note to 4027), <i>lathe</i>, barn,
  <i>fonne</i>, fool, <i>hething</i>, contempt, <i>taa</i>, take. To these
  Tyrwhitt adds <i>gar</i>, reading <i>Gar us have mete</i> in l. 4132, but
  I can only find <i>Get us som mete</i> in my seven MSS. <i>Capul</i>,
  horse, occurs again in D. 1554, 2150.</p>

  <p>I think Mr. Ellis a little underrates the 'marked northernism' of
  Chaucer's specimens. Certainly <i>thou is</i> is as marked as <i>I
  is</i>; and other certain marks are the pl. indic. in <i><span
  class="nw">-es</span></i>, as in <i>werk-es</i>, 4030, the use of
  <i>sal</i> for 'shall,' of <i>boes</i> for 'behoves,' of <i>taa</i> for
  'take,' of <i>hethen</i> for 'hence,' of <i>slyk</i> for 'such,' the
  prepositions <i>fra</i> and <i>y-mel</i>, and even some of the
  peculiarities of pronunciation, as <i>&#x101;</i> for <i>&#x14D;</i>,
  <i>wrang</i> for <i>wrong</i>.</p>

  <p>It is worth enquiring whether Chaucer has made any mistakes, and it is
  clear that he has made several. Thus <i>as clerkes sayn</i> (4028) should
  be <i>as clerkes says</i>; and <i>sayth</i> should again be <i>says</i>
  in l. 4210. In l. 4171, <i>hem</i> (them) should be <i>thaim</i>. In l.
  4180, <i>y-greved</i> should be <i>greved</i>; the Northern dialect knows
  nothing of the prefix <i>y-</i>. It also ignores the final <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i> in definite adjectives; hence <i>thy fair-e</i>
  (4023), <i>this short-e</i> (4265), and <i>this lang-e</i> (4175) all
  have a superfluous <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>. Of course this is
  what we should expect; the poet merely gives <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[122]</span>a Northern colouring to
  his diction to amuse us; he is not trying to teach us Northern grammar.
  The general effect is excellent, and that is all he was concerned
  with.</p>

  <p>4020. The mill lay a little way off the road on the left (coming from
  Trumpington); so it was necessary to 'know the way.'</p>

  <p>4026. <i>nede has na peer</i>, necessity has no equal, or, is above
  all. More commonly, <i>Nede ne hath no lawe</i>, as in P. Plowman, B. xx.
  10, or C. xxiii. 10; 'Necessitas non habet legem'; a common proverb.</p>

  <p>4027. <i>boës</i>, contracted from <i>behoves</i>, a form peculiar to
  Chaucer. In northern poems, the word is invariably a monosyllable, spelt
  <i>bos</i>, or more commonly <i>bus</i>; and the pt. t. is likewise a
  monosyllable, viz. <i>bud</i> or <i>bood</i>, short for <i>behoved</i>.
  In Cursor Mundi, l. 9870, we have: 'Of a woman <i>bos him</i> be born;
  and in l. 10639: 'Than <i>bus</i> this may be clene and bright.' In
  M.&nbsp;E., it is always used impersonally; <i>him boes</i> or <i>him bos</i>
  means 'it behoves him,' or 'he must.' See <i>Bus</i> in the New E.
  Dictionary.</p>

  <p>Chaucer here evidently alludes to some such proverb as 'He who has no
  servant must serve himself,' but I do not know the precise form of it.
  The expression 'as clerkes sayn' hints that it is a Latin one.</p>

  <p>4029. <i>hope</i>, expect, fear. Cf. P. Plowman, C. x. 275, and see
  <i>Hope</i> in Nares, who cites the story of the tanner of Tamworth (from
  Puttenham's Arte of Poesie, bk. iii. c. 22) who said&mdash;'I <i>hope</i>
  I shall be hanged to-morrow.' Cf. also Thomas of Erceldoun, ed. Murray,
  l. 78:&mdash;</p>

  <p>4030. 'So ache his molar teeth.' <i>Wark</i>, to ache, is common in
  Yorkshire: 'My back <i>warks</i> while I can hardly bide,' my back aches
  so that I can hardly endure; Mid. Yks. Gloss. (E. D. S.).</p>

  <p>4032. <i>ham</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>h&#x101;m</i>, <i>haam</i>, home.</p>

  <p>4033. <i>hethen</i>, hence, is very characteristic of a Northern
  dialect; it occurs in Hampole, Havelok, Morris's Allit. Poems, Gawain,
  Robert of Brunne, the Ormulum, &amp;c.; see examples in Mätzner.</p>

  <p>4037. One clerk wants to watch above, and the other below, to prevent
  cheating. This incident is not in the French fabliaux. On the other hand,
  it occurs in the Jest of the Mylner of Abyngton, which is plainly copied
  from Chaucer.</p>

  <p>4049. <i>blere hir yë</i>, blear their eyes, cheat them, as in l.
  3865.</p>

  <p>4055. 'The fable of the Wolf and the Mare is found in the Latin
  Esopean collections, and in the early French poem of <i>Renard le
  Contrefait</i>, from whence it appears to have been taken into the
  English <i>Reynard the Fox</i>'; Wright. Tyrwhitt observes that the same
  story is told of a mule in Cento Novelle Antiche, no. 91. See Caxton's
  Reynard, ch. 27, ed. Arber, p. 62, where the wolf wants to buy a mare's
  foal, who said that the price of the foal was written on her hinder foot;
  'yf ye conne rede and be a clerk, ye may come see and rede it.' And when
  <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>[123]</span>the wolf said, 'late me rede it,' the mare
  gave him so violent a kick that 'a man shold wel haue ryden a myle er he
  aroos.' The Fox, who had brought it all about, hypocritically condoles
  with the Wolf, and observes&mdash;'Now I here wel it is true that I long
  syth haue redde and herde, that <i>the beste clerkes ben not the wysest
  men</i>.'</p>

  <p>For the story in Le Roman du Renard Contrefait, see Poètes de
  Champagne, Reims, 1851, p. 156. For further information, see Caxton's
  Fables of Æsop, ed. Jacobs, lib. v. fab. 10; vol. i. 254, 255; vol. ii.
  157, 179. La Fontaine has a similar fable of the Fox, the Wolf, and the
  Horse. In Croxall's Æsop, it is told of the Horse, who tells the Lion,
  who is acting as physician, that he has a thorn in his foot. See further
  references in the Exempla of Jacques de Vitry, ed. Crane, pp. 147,
  197.</p>

  <p>4061. <i>levesel</i>, an arbour or shelter formed of branches or
  foliage. <i>Lev-e</i> is the stem of <i>leef</i>, A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>l&#x113;af</i>, a leaf; and <i><span class="nw">-sel</span></i> is the
  same as the A. S. <i>sæl</i>, <i>sele</i>, a hall, dwelling, Swed.
  <i>sal</i>, Icel. <i>salr</i>, G. <i>Saal</i>. The A. S. <i>sæl</i>
  occurs also in composition, as <i>burg-sæl</i>, <i>folc-sæl</i>,
  <i>horn-sæl</i>, and <i>sele</i> is still commoner; Grein gives
  twenty-three compounds with the latter, as <i>gæst-sele</i>, guest-hall,
  <i>hr&#x14D;f-sele</i>, roofed-hall, &amp;c. In Icel. we have
  <i>lauf-hús</i>, leaf-house, but we find the very word we require in
  Swed. <i>löfsal</i>, 'a hut built of green boughs,' Widegren; Dan.
  <i>lövsals-fest</i>, feast of tabernacles. The word occurs again in the
  Persones Tale, l. 411, where it means a leafy arbour such as may still be
  seen to form the porch of a public-house. The word is scarce; but see the
  following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>4101. <i>Iossa</i>, 'down here'; a cry of direction. Composed of O. F.
  <i>jos</i>, <i>jus</i>, down; and <i>ça</i>, here. Bartsch gives an
  example of <i>jos</i> in his Chrestomathie, 1875, col 8: 'tuit li felun
  cadegren <i>jos</i>,' all the felons fell down; and Cotgrave has:
  '<i>Jus</i>, downe, or to the ground.' Godefroy gives: <i>ça jus</i>,
  here below, down here. It is clearly a direction given by one clerk to
  the other, and was probably a common cry in driving horses.</p>

  <p><i>warderere</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>warde arere</i>, 'look out behind!' Another
  similar cry. MS. Cm. has: <i>ware the rere</i>, mind the rear, which is a
  sort of gloss upon it.</p>

  <p>4110. <i>hething</i>, contempt. See numerous examples in Mätzner, s.
  v. <i>hæthing</i>, ii. 396. Cf. 'Bothe in <i>hething</i> and in
  <i>scorn</i>'; Sir Amadace, l. 17, in Robson's <i>Three Met.
  Romances</i>, p. 27. 'Him thoght <i>scorn</i> and gret <i>hething</i>';
  Seven Sages, ed. Weber, l. 91.</p>

  <p>4112. The first foot is 'trochaic.'</p>

  <p>4115. <i>in his hond</i>, in his possession, in his hold.</p>

  <p>4126. 'Or enlarge it by argument'; prove by logic that it is the size
  you wish it to be.</p>

  <p>4127. <i>Cutberd</i>, St. Cuthbert, bishop of Lindisfarne, died in
  686. Being a Northumberland man, John swears by a Northumberland
  saint.</p>

  <p>4130. Evidently a proverb: 'a man must take (one) of two things,
  either such as he finds or such as he brings'; i.&nbsp;e. must put up with
  what he can get.</p>

  <p>4134. Another proverb. Repeated in D. 415, with <i>lure</i> for
  <i>tulle</i>. From the Policraticus of John of Salisbury, liv. v. c. 10:
  'Veteri <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page125"></a>[125]</span>celebratur proverbio: Quia vacuae manus
  temeraria petitio est.' MS. Cm. has the rimes <i>folle</i>, <i>tolle</i>.
  For <i>tulle</i>, a commoner spelling is <i>tille</i>, to draw, hence to
  allure, entice. Hence E. <i>till</i> (for money), orig. meaning a
  'drawer'; and the <i>tiller</i> of a rudder, by which it is drawn aside.
  See <i>tullen</i> in Stratmann, and <i>tollen</i> in Boeth. bk. ii. pr.
  7. 11 (in vol. ii. p. 45).</p>

  <p>4140. <i>chalons</i>, blankets. The same word as mod. E.
  <i>shalloon</i>, 'a slight woollen stuff'; Ogilvie's Dict. 'The blanket
  was sometimes made of a texture originally imported from Chalons in
  France, but afterwards extensively manufactured in England by the
  Chaloners'; Our Eng. Home, p. 108. 'Qwyltes ne <i>chalouns</i>'; Eng.
  Gilds, ed. Toulmin Smith, p. 350.</p>

  <p>4152. <i>quakke</i>, asthma, or difficulty of breathing that causes a
  croaking noise. Halliwell gives: '<i>Quack</i>, to be noisy, <i>West</i>.
  The term is applied to any croaking noise.' Also: '<i>Quackle</i>, to
  choke, or suffocate, <i>East</i>.' <i>Pose</i>, a cold in the head; A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>gepos</i>.</p>

  <p>4155. '<i>To wet one's whistle</i>' is still in use for to drink
  deeply. '<i>I wete my whystell</i>, as good drinkers do'; Palsgrave, p.
  780. In Walton's Complete Angler, Part i. ch. 5, we find: 'Let's drink
  the other cup to <i>wet our whistles</i>.'</p>

  <p>4172. <i>wilde fyr</i>, erysipelas (to torment them); see Halliwell.
  Cf. E. 2252. The entry&mdash;'<i>Erysipela</i> (<i>sic</i>), wilde fyr'
  occurs in Ælfric's Vocabulary. So in Le Rom. de la Rose:&mdash;'que
  Mal-Feu l'arde'; 7438, 8319.</p>

  <p>4174. <i>flour</i>, choice, best of a thing; <i>il ending</i>, evil
  death, bad end. 'They shall have the best (i.&nbsp;e. here, the worst) of a
  bad end.' Rather a wish than a prophecy.</p>

  <p>4181. Sidenote in MS. Hl.&mdash;'Qui in vno grauatur in alio debet

  <p>4194. <i>upright</i>, upon her back. 'To slepe on the backe,
  <i>vpryght</i>, is vtterly to be abhorred'; Babees Book, ed. Furnivall,
  p. 245. Palsgrave, s. v. <i>Throwe</i>, has: 'I throwe a man <i>on his
  backe</i> or <i>upright</i>, so that his face is upwarde, <i>Ie
  renuerse</i>.' And see Nares. Cf. 'Now dounward groffe [on your belly],
  and now <i>upright</i>'; Rom. Rose, 2561. <i>Bolt-upright</i> occurs in
  l. 4266; where <i>bolt</i> is 'like a bolt,' hence 'straight,' or
  exactly. See <i>Bolt</i>, adv., in the New E. Dictionary. And compare B.
  1506.</p>

  <p>4208. <i>daf</i>, fool; from E. <i>daf-t</i>. <i>cokenay</i>, a
  milk-sop, poor creature. The orig. sense of <i>coken-ay</i> is 'cocks'
  egg,' from a singular piece of folk-lore which credited cocks with laying
  such eggs as happen to be imperfect. 'The small yolkless eggs which hens
  sometimes lay are called "cocks' eggs," generally in the firm persuasion
  that the name states a fact'; Shropshire Folklore, by C. S. Burne, p.
  229. The idea is old, and may be found gravely stated as a fact in
  Bartolomæus De Proprietatibus Rerum (14th century). See <i>Cockney</i> in
  the New E. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>4210. <i>Unhardy is unsely</i>, the cowardly man has no luck.
  'Audentes <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>[126]</span>fortuna iuuat'; Vergil, Aen. x. 284. So
  also our 'Nothing venture, nothing have,' and 'Faint heart never won fair
  lady'; which see in Hazlitt's Proverbs. For <i>seel</i>, luck, see l.
  4239. See Troil. iv. 602, and the note.</p>

  <p>4220. Pronounce <i>ben'cite</i> in three syllables; as usual.</p>

  <p>4233. <i>The thridde cok</i>; apparently, between 5 and 6 <span
  class="sm">A.M.</span>; see note to line 3675 above. It was near dawn;
  see l. 4249.</p>

  <p>4236. <i>Malin</i>, another form of <i>Malkin</i>, which is a pet-name
  for <i>Matilda</i>. See my note to P. Plowman, C. ii. 181, where my
  statement that <i>Malkin</i> occurs in the present passage refers to
  Tyrwhitt's edition, which substitutes <i>Malkin</i> for the <i>Malin</i>
  or <i>Malyn</i> of the MSS. and of ed. 1532. Cf. B. 30.</p>

  <p>'<i>Malyn</i>, tersorium,' Cath. Anglicum; i.&nbsp;e. <i>Malin</i>, like
  <i>Malkin</i>, also meant a dishclout. <i>Malin</i> has now become
  <i>Molly</i>.</p>

  <p>4244. <i>cake.</i> In Wright's Glossaries, ed. Wülker, col. 788, l.
  36, we find, '<i>Hic panis subverucius</i>, a meleres cake'; on which
  Wright remarks: 'Perhaps this name alludes to the common report that the
  miller always stole the flour from his customers to make his cakes, which
  were baked on the sly.'</p>

  <p>4253. <i>toty</i>, in the seven MSS.; <i>totty</i> in ed. 1532. It
  means 'dizzy, reeling'; and Halliwell, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Totty</i>, quotes from
  MS. Rawl. C. 86: 'So <i>toty</i> was the brayn of his hede.' Cf. 'And
  some also so <i>toty</i> in theyr heade'; Lydgate, Siege of Troy, ed.
  1555, fol. L 1, back. Spenser has the word twice, as <i>tottie</i> or
  <i>totty</i>, and evidently copied it from this very passage, which he
  read in a black-letter edition; see his Shep. Kal., <i>February</i>, 55,
  and F.&nbsp;Q. vii. 7. 39. Cf. E. <i>totter</i>.</p>

  <p>4257. <i>a twenty devel way</i>, with extremely ill-luck. See note to
  l. 3713.</p>

  <p>4264. Compare B. 1417.</p>

  <p>4272. <i>linage</i>; her grandfather was a priest; see note to l.

  <p>It here occurs in company with the Creed, the Paternoster, and the Ave
  Maria; so that it was one of the very common religious formulae which
  were familiar, even in the Latin form, to people of no education. They
  frequently knew the words of these forms, without knowing more than the
  general sense. <i>In manus tuas</i>, &amp;c., was even recited by
  criminals before being hung; see Skelton's Works, ed. Dyce, i. 5, 292,

  <p>4320. <i>Him thar</i>, lit. 'it needs him,' i.&nbsp;e. he need, he must.
  For <i>thar</i>, ed. 1532 has <i>dare</i>, which Tyrwhitt rightly
  corrects to <i>thar</i>, which occurs again in D. 329, 336, 1365, and H.
  352. It is common enough in early authors; the full form is <i>tharf</i>,
  as in Owl and Nightingale, 803 (or 180), Moral Ode (Jesus MS.), 44; spelt
  <i>tharrf</i>, Ormulum, 12886; <i>therf</i>, Ancren Riwle, p. 192;
  <i>darf</i>, Floris and Blancheflur, 315; <i>derf</i>, O. Eng. Homilies,
  ed. Morris, i. 187, l. 31; <i>dar</i>, Octovian, 1337; &amp;c. The pt. t.
  is <i>thurfte</i>, <i>thurte</i>, <i>thorte</i>; see <i>tharf</i> and
  <i>thurfen</i> in Stratmann, and cf. A.&nbsp;S. <i>thearf</i>, pt. t.
  <i>thurfte</i>. For <i>wene</i>, the correct reading, Tyrwhitt
  substitutes <i>winne</i>, against all authority, because he could make no
  sense of <i>wene</i>. It is odd that he should have missed the sense so
  completely. <i>Wene</i> is to imagine, think, also to expect; and the
  line means 'he must not expect good who does evil.' The very word is
  preserved by Ray, in his Proverbs, 3rd ed., 1737, p. 288:&mdash;'He that
  evil does, never good <i>weines</i>.' Hazlitt quotes a proverb to a like
  effect: 'He that does what he should not, shall feel what he would not.'

  <p>4329. <i>herbergage</i>, lodging; alluding to l. 4123.</p>

  <p>4331. Not from Solomon, but from Ecclesiasticus, xi. 31: 'Non omnem

  E. version, it is verse 29.</p>

  <p>4336. <i>Hogge</i>, Hodge, for <i>Roger</i> (l. 4353). <i>Ware</i>, in

  <p>4346. <i>laten blood</i>, let blood, i.&nbsp;e. removed gravy from. It
  refers to a meat-pie, baked with gravy in it; as it was not sold the day
  it was made, the gravy was removed to make it keep longer; and so the pie
  was eaten at last, when far from being new.</p>

  <p>4347. The meaning of 'a Jack of Dover' has been much disputed, but it
  probably meant a pie that had been cooked more than once. Some have
  thought it meant a sole (probably a fried sole), as 'Dover soles' are
  still celebrated; but this is only a guess, and seems to be wrong. Sir T.
  More, Works, p. 675 E, speaks of a '<i>Jak of Paris</i>, an evil pye
  twyse baken'; which is probably the same thing. Roquefort's <i>French
  Dict.</i> has:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'<i>Jaquet</i>, <i>Jaket</i>, impudent, menteur. C'est sans doute de
  ce mot que les pâtissiers ont pris leur mot d'argot <i>jaques</i>, pour
  signifier qu'une pièce de volaille, de viande ou de pâtisserie cuite au
  four, est vieille ou dure.'</p>

  <p>See Hazlitt's Proverbs, p. 20; and Hazlitt's Shakespeare Jest-books,
  ii. 366. Hence, in a secondary sense, <i>Jack of Dover</i> meant an old
  story, or hashed up anecdote. Ray says:&mdash;'This he [T. Fuller] makes
  parallel to <i>Crambe bis cocta</i>, and applicable to such as grate the
  ears of their auditors with ungrateful tautologies of what is worthless
  in itself; tolerable as once uttered in the notion of novelty, but
  abominable if repeated.' This may explain the fact that an old jest-book
  was printed with the title <i>A Jack of Dover</i> in 1604, and again in
  1615. The E. word <i>jack</i> has indeed numerous senses.</p>

  <p>4350. The insinuation is that stray flies were mixed up with the
  parsley served up with the Cook's geese. Tyrwhitt quotes from MS. Harl.
  279&mdash;'Take <i>percely</i>,' &amp;c. in a receipt for stuffing a
  goose; so that parsley was sometimes used for this purpose. It was also
  used for stuffing chickens; see Liber Cure Cocorum, ed. Morris, p.
  22.</p>

  <p>4357. 'A true jest is an evil jest.' Hazlitt, in his Collection of
  Proverbs, gives, 'True jest is no jest,' and quotes 'Sooth bourd is no
  bourd' from Heywood, and from Harington's Brief Apologie of Poetrie,
  1591. Kelly's Scotch Proverbs includes: 'A sooth bourd is nae bourd.'
  Tyrwhitt alters the second <i>play</i> to <i>spel</i>, as being a Flemish
  word, but he only found it in two MSS. (Askew 1 and 2), and nothing is
  gained <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>[129]</span>by it. The fact is, that there is nothing
  Flemish about the proverb except the word <i>quad</i>, though there may
  have been an equivalent proverb in that language. We must take Chaucer's
  remark to mean that 'Sooth play is what a Fleming would call <i>quaad</i>
  play'; which is then quite correct. For just as Flemish does not use the
  English words <i>sooth</i> and <i>play</i>, so English seldom uses the
  Flemish form <i>quaad</i>, equivalent to the Dutch <i>kwaad</i>, evil,
  bad, spelt <i>quade</i> in Hexham's Du. Dict. (1658). Cf. also O. Friesic
  <i>kwad</i>, <i>quad</i>, East Friesic <i>kwâd</i> (still in common use).
  The Mid. Eng. form is not <i>quad</i>, but (properly) <i>qu&#x113;d</i>
  or <i>queed</i>; see examples in Stratmann, s.&nbsp;v. <i>cwêd</i>. In P.
  Plowman, B. xiv. 189, <i>the qued</i> means the Evil One, the devil.
  <i>Queed</i> occurs as a sb. as late as in Skelton, ed. Dyce, i. 168. We
  find, however, the rare M.&nbsp;E. form <i>quad</i> in Gower, ed. Pauli, ii.
  246, and in the Story of Genesis and Exodus, ed. Morris, 536; and in
  another passage of the Cant. Tales, viz. B. 1628. The oldest English
  examples seem to be those in the Blickling Glosses, viz. 'of cweade
  arærende, <i>de stercore erigens</i>'; and 'cwed <i>uel</i> meox,
  <i>stercus</i>.' There is no difficulty about the etymology; the
  corresponding O. H. G. word is <i>qu&#x101;t</i>, whence G. <i>Koth</i>
  or <i>Kot</i>, excrement; and the root appears in the Skt. <i>gu</i> or
  <i>g&#x16B;</i>, to void excrement; see <i>Kot</i> in Kluge.</p>

  <p>4358. This is interesting, as giving us the Host's name. <i>Herry</i>
  is the mod. E. <i>Harry</i>, with the usual change from <i>er</i> to
  <i>ar</i>, as in M.&nbsp;E. <i>derk</i>, dark, &amp;c. It is the same as the
  F. <i>Herri</i> (not uncommon in O. F.), made from F. <i>Henri</i> by
  assimilation of <i>nr</i> to <i>rr</i>.</p>

  <p>The name seems to have been taken from that of a real person. In the
  Subsidy Rolls, 4 Rich. II. (1380-1), for Southwark, occurs the
  entry&mdash;'Henri' Bayliff, Ostyler, Xpian [Christian] ux[or] eius ...
  ij <i>s.</i>' In the parliament held at Westminster, in 50 Edw. III.
  (1376-7), Henry Bailly was one of the representatives for that borough;
  and again, in the parliament at Gloucester, 2 Rich. II., the name occurs.

  <p>4379. T. has <i>And til</i>, but his note says that <i>And</i> was
  inserted by himself. Wright reads, 'And tyl he hadde'; but <i>And</i> is
  not in the Harleian MS. Observe that Wright insists very much on the fact
  that he reproduces this MS. 'with literal accuracy,' though he allows
  himself, according to his own account, to make silent alterations due to
  collation with the Lansdowne MS. But the word <i>And</i> is not to be
  found in any of the seven MSS., and this is only <i>one</i> example of
  the numerous cases in which he has <i>silently</i> altered his text
  without any <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  is full of treacherous pitfalls; and Bell's edition is quite as bad,
  though that likewise pretends to be accurate.</p>

  <p>The easiest way of scanning the line is to ignore the elision of the
  final <i>e</i> in <i>had-de</i>, which is preserved, as often, by the

  <p>4396. 'Though he (the apprentice) may know how to play,' &amp;c.
  Opposed to l. 4394. The sense is&mdash;'The master pays for the revelling
  of the apprentice, though he takes no part in such revel; and conversely,
  the apprentice may gain skill in minstrelsy, but takes no part in paying
  for it; for, in his case, his rioting is convertible with theft.' The
  master pays, but plays not; the other pays not, but plays.</p>

  <p>4397. 'Revelling and honesty, in the case of one of low degree (who
  has no money), are continually wrath with (i.&nbsp;e. opposed to) each
  other.'</p>

  <p>4402. 'And sometimes carried off to Newgate, with revel (such as he
  might be supposed to approve of).' The point of the allusion lies in the
  fact that, when disorderly persons were carried to prison, they were
  preceded <i>by minstrels</i>, in order to call public attention to their
  disgrace. This is clearly shewn in the Liber Albus, pp. 459, 460, (p. 396
  of the E. translation). E.&nbsp;g. 'Item, if any person shall be impeached of
  adultery, and be thereof lawfully attainted, let him be <i>taken unto
  Newgate</i>, and from thence, <i>with minstrelsy</i>, through Chepe, to
  the Tun on Cornhulle [Cornhill], there to remain at the will of the mayor
  and alderman.'</p>

  <p>4404. <i>paper.</i> The allusion is not clear; perhaps it means that
  he was referring to his account-book, and found it unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p>4406. In Hazlitt's Proverbs we find; 'The rotten apple injures its
  neighbour.' Cf. G. 964.</p>

  <p>In the Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 205, we are bidden to avoid bad company,
  because a rotten apple rots the sound ones, if left among them.</p>

  <p>In Ida von Düringsfeld's Sprichwörter, 1872-5, no. 354, is:&mdash;'Ein
  fauler Apfel steckt den andern an. Pomum compunctum cito corrumpit sibi
  iunctum.'</p>

  <p>4413. <i>his leve</i>, his leave to go, his dismissal, his
  <i>congé</i>.</p>

  <p>4414. <i>or leve</i>, or leave it, i.&nbsp;e. or desist from it.</p>

  <p>4415. <i>for</i>, because, since. <i>louke</i>, an accomplice who
  entices the dupe into the thief's company, a decoyer of victims. Not 'a
  receiver to a thief,' as Tyrwhitt guessed, but his assistant in thieving,
  one who helped him (as Chaucer says) to suck others by stealing or
  borrowing. It answers to an A.&nbsp;S. <i>*l&#x16B;ca</i> (not found), formed
  with the agential suffix <i><span class="nw">-a</span></i> from
  <i>l&#x16B;can</i>, lit. to pull, pluck, root up weeds, hence (probably)
  to draw, entice. The corresponding E. Friesic <i>l&#x16B;kan</i> or
  <i>lukan</i> means not only to pull, pluck, but also to milk or suck (see
  Koolman). The Low G. <i>luken</i> means not only to pull up weeds, but
  <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>[131]</span>also to suck down, or to take a long pull
  in drinking; hence O.&nbsp;F. <i>louchier</i>, <i>loukier</i>, to swallow.
  From the A.&nbsp;S. <i>l&#x16B;can</i>, to pluck up, comes the common prov. E.
  <i>louk</i>, <i>lowk</i>, <i>look</i>, to pluck up weeds; see Ray, Whitby

  <p>4417. <i>brybe</i>, to purloin; not to bribe in the modern sense; see

  finished.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">NOTES TO GROUP B.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Introduction to the Man of Lawes Tale.</b></p>

  <p>1. If, as Mr. Furnivall supposes, the time of the telling of the
  Canterbury Tales be taken to be longer than one day, we may suppose the
  Man of Lawes Tale to begin the stories told on the <i>second</i> morning
  of the journey, April 18. Otherwise, we must suppose all the stories in
  Group A to precede it, which is not impossible, if we suppose the
  pilgrims to have started early in the morning.</p>

  <p><i>Hoste.</i> This is one of the words which are sometimes
  dissyllabic, and sometimes monosyllabic; it is here a dissyllable, as in
  l. 39. See note to line 1883 below.</p>

  <p><i>sey</i>, i.&nbsp;e. saw. The forms of 'saw' vary in the MSS. In this
  line we find <i>saugh</i>, <i>sauh</i>, <i>segh</i>, <i>sauhe</i>,
  <i>sawh</i>, none of which are Chaucer's own, but due to the scribes. The
  true form is determined by the rime, as in the Clerkes Tale, E. 667,
  where most of the MSS. have <i>say</i>. A still better spelling is
  <i>sey</i>, which may be found in the House of Fame, 1151, where it rimes
  with <i>lay</i>. The A.&nbsp;S. form is <i>s&#x113;ah</i>.</p>

  <p>2. <i>The ark</i>, &amp;c. In Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe, pt.
  ii. ch. 7 (vol. iii. 194), is the proposition headed&mdash;'to knowe the
  arch of the day, that some folk callen the day artificial, from the sonne
  arysing til hit go to reste.' Thus, while the 'day natural' is
  twenty-four hours, the 'day artificial' is the time during which the sun
  is above the horizon. The 'arc' of this day merely means the extent or
  duration of it, as reckoned along the circular rim of an astrolabe; or,
  when measured along the horizon (as here), it means the arc extending
  from the point of sunrise to that of sunset. <i>ronne</i>, run,
  performed, completed.</p>

  <p>3. <i>The fourthe part.</i> The true explanation of this passage,
  which Tyrwhitt failed to discover, is due to Mr. A. E. Brae, who first
  published it in May, 1851, and reprinted it at p. 68 of his edition of
  Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe. His conclusions were based upon
  actual calculation, and will be mentioned in due order. In re-editing the
  'Astrolabe,' I took the opportunity of roughly checking his calculations
  by other methods, and am satisfied that he is quite correct, and that the
  day meant is not the 28th of April, as in the Ellesmere MS., nor the 13th
  of April, as in the Harleian MS., but the 18th, as in the Hengwrt <!--
  Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>[133]</span>MS.
  and most others. It is easily seen that <i>xviii</i> may be corrupted
  into <i>xxviii</i> by prefixing <i>x</i>, or into <i>xiii</i> by the
  omission of <i>v</i>; this may account for the variations.</p>

  <p>The key to the whole matter is given by a passage in Chaucer's
  'Astrolabe,' pt. ii. ch. 29, where it is clear that Chaucer (who,
  however, merely translates from Messahala) actually confuses the
  hour-angle with the azimuthal arc; that is, he considered it correct to
  find the hour of the day by noting <i>the point of the horizon</i> over
  which the sun appears to stand, and supposing this point to advance, with
  a <i>uniform</i>, not a <i>variable</i>, motion. The host's method of
  proceeding was this. Wanting to know the hour, he observed how far the
  sun had moved southward along the horizon since it rose, and saw that it
  had gone more than half-way from the point of sunrise to the exact
  southern point. Now the 18th of April in Chaucer's time answers to the
  26th of April at present. On April 26, 1874, the sun rose at 4h. 43m.,
  and set at 7h. 12m., giving a day of about 14h. 30m., the fourth part of
  which is at 8h. 20m., or, with sufficient exactness, at <i>half-past
  eight</i>. This would leave a whole hour and a half to signify Chaucer's
  'half an houre and more,' shewing that further explanation is still
  necessary. The fact is, however, that the host reckoned, as has been
  said, in another way, viz. by observing the sun's position <i>with
  reference to the horizon</i>. On April 18 the sun was in the 6th degree
  of Taurus at that date, as we again learn from Chaucer's treatise. Set
  this 6th degree of Taurus on the East horizon on a globe, and it is found
  to be 22 degrees to the North of the East point, or 112 degrees from the
  South. The half of this is at 56 degrees from the South; and the sun
  would seem to stand above this 56th degree, as may be seen even upon a
  globe, at about a quarter past nine; but Mr. Brae has made the
  calculation, and shews that it was at <i>twenty minutes past nine</i>.
  This makes Chaucer's 'half an houre and more' to stand for <i>half an
  hour and ten minutes</i>; an extremely neat result. But this we can check
  again by help of the host's <i>other</i> observation. He <i>also</i> took
  note, that the lengths of a shadow and its object were equal, whence the
  sun's altitude must have been 45 degrees. Even a globe will shew that the
  sun's altitude, when in the 6th degree of Taurus, and at 10 o'clock in
  the morning, is somewhere about 45 or 46 degrees. But Mr. Brae has
  calculated it exactly, and his result is, that the sun attained its
  altitude of 45 degrees at <i>two minutes to ten</i> exactly. This is even
  a closer approximation than we might expect, and leaves no doubt about
  the right date being the <i>eighteenth</i> of April. For fuller
  particulars, see Chaucer on the Astrolabe, ed. Brae, p. 69; and ed. Skeat
  (E.E.T.S.), preface, p. 1.</p>

  <p>5. <i>eightetethe</i>, eighteenth. Mr. Wright prints
  <i>eightetene</i>, with the remark that 'this is the reading in which the
  MSS. seem mostly to agree.' This is right in substance, but not
  critically exact. No such word as <i>eightetene</i> appears here in the
  MSS., which denote the number by an abbreviation, as stated in the
  footnote. The Hengwrt MS. has <i>xviijthe</i>, and the Old English for
  <i>eighteenth</i> must have have been <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[134]</span><i>eightetethe</i>, the
  ordinal, not the cardinal number. This form is easily inferred from the
  numerous examples in which <i><span class="nw">-teenth</span></i> is
  represented by <i><span class="nw">-tethe</span></i>; see
  <i>feowertethe</i>, <i>fiftethe</i>, &amp;c. in Stratmann's Old English
  Dictionary; we find the very form <i>eightetethe</i> in Rob. of Glouc.,
  ed. Wright, 6490; and <i>eighteteothe</i> in St. Swithin, l. 5, as
  printed in Poems and Lives of Saints, ed. Furnivall, 1858, p. 43.
  <i>Eighte</i> is of two syllables, from A.&nbsp;S. <i>eahta</i>, cognate with
  Lat. <i>octo</i>. <i>Eightetethe</i> has four syllables; see A. 3223, and
  the note.</p>

  <p>8. <i>as in lengthe</i>, with respect to its length.</p>

  <p>13. The astrolabe which Chaucer gave to his little son Lewis was
  adapted for the latitude of Oxford. If, as is likely, the poet-astronomer
  checked his statements in this passage by a reference to it, he would
  neglect the difference in latitude between Oxford and the Canterbury
  road. In fact, it is less than a quarter of a degree, and not worth
  considering in the present case.</p>

  <p>14. <i>gan conclude</i>, did conclude, concluded. <i>Gan</i> is often
  used thus as an auxiliary verb.</p>

  <p>15. <i>plighte</i>, plucked; cf. <i>shrighte</i>, shrieked, in Kn. A.
  2817.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>16. <i>Lordinges</i>, sirs. This form of address is exceedingly common
  in Early English poetry. Cf. the first line in the Tale of Sir
  Thopas.</p>

  <p>18. <i>seint Iohn.</i> See the Squire's Tale, F. 596.</p>

  <p>19. <i>Leseth</i>, lose ye; note the form of the imperative plural in
  <i><span class="nw">-eth</span></i>; cf. l. 37. <i>As ferforth as ye
  may</i>, as far as lies in your power.</p>

  <p>20. <i>wasteth</i>, consumeth; cf. <i>wastour</i>, a wasteful person,
  in P. Plowm. B. vi. 154.&mdash;M. Hl. has <i>passeth</i>, i.&nbsp;e. passes
  away; several MSS. insert <i>it</i> before <i>wasteth</i>, but it is not
  required by the metre, since the <i>e</i> in <i>time</i> is here fully
  sounded; cf. A.&nbsp;S. <i>t&#x12B;ma</i>. Compare&mdash;</p>

  <p>25. Seneca wrote a treatise De Breuitate Temporis, but this does not
  contain any passage very much resembling the text. I have no doubt that
  Chaucer was thinking of a passage which may easily have caught <!-- Page
  135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>[135]</span>his eye,
  as being very near the beginning of the first of Seneca's epistles.
  'Quaedam tempora eripiuntur nobis, quaedam subducuntur, quaedam
  <i>effluunt. Turpissima tamen est iactura, quae per negligentiam fit.</i>
  Quem mihi dabis, qui aliquod pretium tempori ponat? qui diem aestimet?...
  In huius rei unius fugacis ac lubricae possessionem natura nos misit, ex
  qua expellit quicumque uult; et tanta stultitia mortalium est, ut, quae
  minima et uilissima sint, <i>certe reparabilia</i>, imputari sibi, quum
  impetrauere, patiantur; nemo se iudicet quidquam debere, qui tempus
  accepit, quum interim <i>hoc unum est, quod ne gratus quidem potest
  reddere</i>'; Epist. I.; Seneca Lucilio suo.</p>

  <p>30. <i>Malkin</i>; a proverbial name for a wanton woman; see P.
  Plowman, C. ii. 181 (B. i. 182), and my note. 'There are more maids than
  Malkin'; Heywood's Proverbs.</p>

  <p>32. <i>moulen</i>, lit. 'become mouldy'; hence, be idle, stagnate,
  remain sluggish, rot. See <i>Mouldy</i> in the Appendix to my Etym. Dict.
  2nd ed. 1884; and cf. note to A. 3870.</p>

  <p>33. <i>Man of Lawe.</i> This is the 'sergeant of the lawe' described
  in the Prologue, ll. 309-330. <i>So have ye blis</i>, so may you obtain
  bliss; as you hope to reach heaven.</p>

  <p>34. <i>as forward is</i>, as is the agreement. See Prologue, A. 33,
  829.</p>

  <p>35. <i>been submitted</i>, have agreed. This illustrates the common
  usage of expressing a perfect by the verb <i>to be</i> and the past part.
  of an <i>intransitive</i> verb. Cf. <i>is went</i>, in B.
  1730.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>36. <i>at my Iugement</i>, at my decree; ready to do as I bid you. See
  Prologue, A. 818 and 833.</p>

  <p>37. <i>Acquiteth yow</i>, acquit yourself, viz. by redeeming your
  promise. <i>holdeth your biheste</i>, keep your promise. <i>Acquit</i>
  means to absolve or free oneself from a debt, obligation, charge,
  &amp;c.; or to free oneself from the claims of duty, by fulfilling
  it.</p>

  <p>38. <i>devoir</i>, duty; see Knightes Tale, A. 2598.</p>

  <p><i>atte leste</i>, at the least. <i>Atte</i> or <i>atten</i> is common
  in Old English for <i>at the</i> or <i>at then</i>; the latter is a later
  form of A.&nbsp;S. <i>æt þ&#x101;m</i>, where <i>then</i> (= <i>þ&#x101;m</i>)
  is the dative case of the article. But for the explanation of peculiar
  forms and words, the Glossarial Index should be consulted.</p>

  <p>39. For <i>ich</i>, Tyrwhitt reads <i>jeo</i> = <i>je</i>, though
  found in none of our seven MSS. This makes the whole phrase
  French&mdash;<i>de par dieux jeo assente</i>. Mr. Jephson suggests that
  this is a clever hit of Chaucer's, because he makes the Man of Lawe talk
  in French, with which, as a lawyer, he was very familiar. However, we
  find elsewhere&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>[136]</span></p>

  <p>It is much more to the point to observe that the Man of Lawe talks
  about <i>law</i> in l. 43. Cotgrave, in his French Dictionary, under
  <i>par</i>, gives&mdash;'<i>De par Dieu soit</i>, a [i.&nbsp;e. in] God's name
  be it. <i>De par moy</i>, by my means. <i>De par le roy</i>, by the
  king's appointment.' <i>De par</i> is a corruption of O.Fr. <i>de
  part</i>, on the part or side of; so that <i>de par le roy</i> means
  literally, 'as for the king,' i.&nbsp;e. 'in the king's name.' Similarly,
  <i>de par Dieu</i> is 'in God's name.' See Burguy, Grammaire de la Langue
  D'oil, ii. 359. The form <i>dieux</i> is a <i>nominative</i>, from the
  Latin <i>deus</i>; thus exhibiting an exception to the almost universal
  law in French, that the modern F. substantives answer to the
  <i>accusative</i> cases of Latin substantives, as <i>fleur</i> to
  <i>florem</i>, &amp;c. Other exceptions may be found in some proper
  names, as <i>Charles</i>, <i>Jacques</i>, from <i>Carolus</i>,
  <i>Jacobus</i>, and in <i>fils</i>, from <i>filius</i>.</p>

  <p>41. In the Morality entitled Everyman, in Hazlitt's Old Eng. Plays, i.
  137, is the proverb&mdash;'Yet promise is debt.' Mr. Hazlitt wrongly
  considers that as the earliest instance of the phrase.&mdash;M. Cf.
  Hoccleve, De Regim. Principum, p. 64:&mdash;'And of a trewe man
  <i>beheest is dette</i>.'</p>

  <p><i>holde fayn</i>, &amp;c.; gladly perform all my promise.</p>

  <p>43. <i>man ... another</i> = one ... another. The Cambridge MS. is
  right.&mdash;M. 'For whatever law a man imposes on others, he should in
  justice consider as binding on himself.' This is obviously a
  <i>quotation</i>, as appears from l. 45. The expression referred to was
  probably proverbial. An English proverb says&mdash;'They that make the
  laws must not break them'; a Spanish one&mdash;'El que ley establece,
  guardarla debe,' he who makes a law ought to keep it; and a Latin
  one&mdash;'Patere legem quam ipse tulisti,' abide by the law which you
  made yourself. The idea is expanded in the following passage from
  Claudian's Panegyric on the 4th consulship of Honorius, carm. viii., l.
  296.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p>Auctorem parere sibi.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>45. <i>text</i>, quotation from an author, precept, saying. <i>Thus

  <p>47. <i>But.</i> This reading is given by Tyrwhitt, from MS. Dd. 4. 24
  in the Cambridge University Library and two other MSS. All our seven MSS.
  read <i>That</i>; but this would require the word <i>Nath</i> (hath not)
  instead of <i>Hath</i>, in l. 49. Chaucer talks about his writings in a
  similar strain in A. 746, 1460; and at a still earlier period, in his
  House of Fame, 620, where Jupiter's eagle says to him:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>can but lewedly on metres</i>, is but slightly skilled in metre.
  <i>Can</i> = <i>knows</i> here; in the line above it is the ordinary
  auxiliary verb.</p>

  <p>54. Ovid is mentioned for two reasons; because he has so many
  love-stories, and because Chaucer himself borrowed several of his own
  from Ovid.</p>

  <p><i>made of mencioun</i>; we should now say&mdash;'made mention
  of.'</p>

  <p>55. <i>Epistelles</i>, Epistles. (T. prints <i>Epistolis</i>, the Lat.
  form, without authority. The word has here four syllables.) The book
  referred to is Ovid's Heroides, which contains twenty-one love-letters.
  See note to l. 61.</p>

  <p>56. <i>What</i>, why, on what account? cf. Prologue, A. 184.</p>

  <p>57. 'The story of Ceyx and Alcyone is related in the introduction to
  the poem which was for some time called "The Dreme of Chaucer," but
  which, in the MSS. Fairfax 16 and Bodl. 638, is more properly entitled,
  "The Boke of the Duchesse."'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. Chaucer took it from Ovid's
  Metamorphoses, bk. xi. 'Ceyx and Alcyone' was once, probably, an
  independent poem; see vol. i. p. 63.</p>

  <p>59. <i>Thise</i> is a monosyllable; the final <i>e</i> probably
  denotes that <i>s</i> was 'voiced,' and perhaps the <i>i</i> was long,
  pronounced (dhiiz).</p>

  <p>59, 60. For <i>eek</i>, <i>seek</i>, read <i>eke</i>, <i>seke</i>.
  Here <i>sek-e</i> is in the infinitive mood. The form <i>ek-e</i> is not
  etymological, as the A.S. <i>&#x113;ac</i> was a monosyllable; but, as
  <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> frequently denoted an <i>adverbial</i>
  suffix, it was easily added. Hence, in M.E., both <i>eek</i> and
  <i>ek-e</i> occur; and Chaucer uses either form at pleasure, <i>ek-e</i>
  being more usual. For examples of <i>eek</i>, see E. 1349, G. 794.</p>

  <p>61. <i>the seintes legende of Cupyde</i>; better known now as The
  Legend of Good Women. Tyrwhitt says&mdash;'According to Lydgate (Prologue
  to Boccace), the number [of good women] was to have been <i>nineteen</i>;
  and perhaps the Legend itself affords some ground for this notion; see l.
  283, and Court of Love, l. 108. But this number was never completed, and
  the last story, of Hypermnestra, is seemingly unfinished.... In this
  passage the Man of Lawe omits two ladies, viz. Cleopatra and Philomela,
  whose histories are in the Legend; and he enumerates eight others, of
  whom there are no histories in the Legend as we have it at present. Are
  we to suppose, that they have been lost?' The Legend contains the nine
  stories following: 1. Cleopatra; 2. Thisbe; 3. Dido; 4. Hypsipyle and
  Medea; 5. Lucretia; 6. Ariadne; 7. Philomela; 8. Phyllis; 9.
  Hypermnestra. Of these, Chaucer here mentions, as Tyrwhitt points out,
  all but two, Cleopatra and Philomela. Before discussing the matter
  further, let me note that in medieval times, proper names took strange
  shapes, and the reader must not suppose that the writing of
  <i>Adriane</i> for <i>Ariadne</i>, for example, is peculiar to Chaucer.
  The meaning of the other names is as follows:&mdash;<i>Lucresse</i>,
  Lucretia; <i>Babilan Tisbee</i>, Thisbe of Babylon; <i>Enee</i>, Æneas;
  <i>Dianire</i>, Deianira; <i>Hermion</i>, Hermione; <i>Adriane</i>,
  Ariadne; <i>Isiphilee</i>, Hypsipyle; <i>Leander</i>, <i>Erro</i>,

  <p>Returning to the question of Chaucer's plan for his Legend of Good
  Women, we may easily conclude what his intention was, though it was never
  carried out. He intended to write stories concerning nineteen women who
  were celebrated for being martyrs of love, and to conclude the series by
  an additional story concerning queen Alcestis, whom he regarded as the
  best of all the good women. Now, though he does not expressly say who
  these women were, he has left us two lists, both incomplete, in which he
  mentions some of them; and by combining these, and taking into
  consideration the stories which he actually wrote, we can make out the
  whole intended series very nearly. One of the lists is the one given
  here; the other is in a Ballad which is introduced into the Prologue to
  the Legend. The key to the incompleteness of the present list, certainly
  the later written of the two, is that the poet chiefly mentions
  <i>here</i> such names as are <i>also</i> to be found in Ovid's Heroides;
  cf. l. 55. Putting all the information together, it is sufficiently clear
  that Chaucer's intended scheme must have been very nearly as follows, the
  number of women (if we include Alcestis) being twenty.</p>

  <p>1. Cleopatra. 2. Thisbe. 3. Dido. 4. and 5. Hypsipyle and Medea. 6.
  Lucretia. 7. Ariadne. 8. Philomela. 9. Phyllis. 10. Hypermnestra
  (unfinished). <i>After which</i>, 11. Penelope. 12. Briseis. 13.
  Hermione. 14. Deianira. 15. Laodamia. 16. Helen. 17. Hero. 18. Polyxena
  (see the Ballad). 19. <i>either</i> Lavinia (see the Ballad), <i>or</i>
  Oenone (mentioned in Ovid, and in the House of Fame). 20. Alcestis.</p>

  <p>Since the list of stories in Ovid's Heroides is the best guide to the
  whole passage, it is here subjoined.</p>

  <p>In this list, the numbers refer to the letters as numbered in Ovid;
  the italics shew the stories which Chaucer actually wrote; the asterisk
  points out such of the remaining stories as he happens to mention in the
  present enumeration; and the dagger points out the ladies mentioned in
  his Prologue to the Legend of Good Women.</p>

  <p>Chaucer's method, I fear, was to plan more than he cared to finish. He
  did so with his Canterbury Tales, and again with his Treatise on the
  Astrolabe; and he left the Squire's Tale half-told. According to his own
  account (Prologue to Legend of Good Women, l. 481) he never intended to
  write his Legend <i>all at once</i>, but only 'yeer by yere.' Such
  proposals are dangerous, and commonly end in incompleteness. To
  Tyrwhitt's question&mdash;'are we to suppose that they [i.&nbsp;e. the legends
  of Penelope and others] have been lost?' the obvious answer is, that they
  were never written.</p>

  <p>Chaucer alludes to Ovid's Epistles again in his House of Fame, bk. i.,
  where he mentions the stories of Phyllis, Briseis, <i>Oenone</i> (not
  mentioned <i>here</i>), Hypsipyle, Medea, Deianira, Ariadne, and Dido;
  the last being told at some length. Again, in the Book of the Duchesse,
  he alludes to Medea, Phyllis, and Dido (ll. 726-734); to Penelope and
  Lucretia (l. 1081); and to Helen (l. 331). As for the stories in the
  Legend which are not in Ovid's Heroides, we find that of Thisbe in Ovid's
  Metamorphoses, bk. iv; that of Philomela in the same, bk. vi; whilst
  those of Cleopatra and Lucretia are in Boccaccio's book De Claris
  Mulieribus, from which he imitated the title 'Legend <i>of Good
  Women</i>,' and derived also the story of Zenobia, as told in the Monkes
  Tale. However, Chaucer also consulted other sources, such as Ovid's Fasti
  (ii. 721) and Livy for Lucretia, &amp;c. See my Introduction to the
  Legend in vol. iii. pp. xxv., xxxvii.</p>

  <p>With regard to the title 'seintes legend of Cupide,' which in modern
  English would be 'Cupid's Saints' Legend,' or 'the Legend of Cupid's
  Saints,' Mr. Jephson remarks&mdash;'This name is one example of the way
  in which Chaucer entered into the spirit of the heathen pantheism, as a
  real form of religion. He considers these persons, who suffered for love,
  to have been saints and martyrs for Cupid, just as Peter and Paul and
  Cyprian were martyrs for Christ.'</p>

  <p>63. Gower also tells the story of Tarquin and Lucrece, which he took,
  says Professor Morley (English Writers, iv. 230), from the Gesta
  Romanorum, which again had it from Augustine's De Civitate Dei.</p>

  <p><i>Babilan</i>, Babylonian; elsewhere Chaucer has <i>Babiloine</i> =
  Babylon, riming with <i>Macedoine</i>; Book of the Duchesse, l. 1061.</p>

  <p>64. <i>swerd</i>, sword; put here for death by the sword. See Virgil's
  Aeneid, iv. 646; and Chaucer's Legend of Good Women, 1351.</p>

  <p>65. <i>tree</i>, put here, most likely, for death by hanging; cf. last
  line. In Chaucer's Legend, 2485, we find&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'She was her owne deeth right <i>with a corde</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The word may also be taken literally, since Phyllis was metamorphosed
  after her death into a tree; Gower says she became a nut-tree, and <!--
  Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>[140]</span>derives <i>filbert</i> from Phyllis; Conf.
  Amant. bk. iv. Lydgate writes <i>filbert</i> instead of Phyllis;
  Complaint of Black Knight, l. 68.</p>

  <p>66. <i>The pleinte of Dianire</i>, the complaint of Deianira,
  referring to Ovid's letter 'Deianira Herculi'; so also that of
  <i>Hermion</i> refers to the letter entitled 'Hermione Orestae'; that of
  <i>Adriane</i>, to the 'Ariadne Theseo'; and that of <i>Isiphilee</i>, to
  the 'Hypsipyle Iasoni.'</p>

  <p>68. <i>bareyne yle</i>, barren island; of which I can find no correct
  explanation by a previous editor. It refers to Ariadne, mentioned in the
  previous line. The expression is taken from Ariadne's letter to Theseus,
  in Ovid's Heroides, Ep. x. 59, where we find 'uacat insula cultu'; and
  just below&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Omne latus terrae cingit mare; nauita nusquam,</p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">Nulla per ambiguas puppis itura uias.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Or, without referring to Ovid at all, the allusion might easily have
  been explained by observing Chaucer's Legend of Ariadne, l. 2163, where
  the island is described as solitary and desolate. It is said to have been
  the isle of Naxos.</p>

  <p>69. Scan&mdash;The dreynt | e Lé | andér |. Here the pp. <i>dreynt</i>
  is used adjectivally, and takes the final <i>e</i> in the definite form.
  So in the Book of the Duchesse, 195, it is best to read <i>the
  dreynte</i>; and in the House of Fame, 1783, we must read <i>the
  sweynte</i>.</p>

  <p>75. <i>Alceste.</i> The story of Alcestis&mdash;'that turned was into
  a dayesie'&mdash;is sketched by Chaucer in his Prologue to the Legend, l.
  511, &amp;c. No doubt he intended to include her amongst the Good Women,
  as the very queen of them all.</p>

  <p>78. <i>Canacee</i>; not the Canace of the Squieres Tale, whom Chaucer
  describes as so kind and good as well as beautiful, but Ovid's Canace.
  The story is told by Gower, Confess. Amantis, book iii. It is difficult
  to resist the conclusion that Chaucer is here making a direct attack upon
  Gower, his former friend; probably because Gower had, in some places,
  imitated the earlier edition of Chaucer's Man of Lawes Tale. This
  difficult question is fully discussed in vol. iii. pp. 413-7.</p>

  <p>81. 'Or else the story of Apollonius of Tyre.' The form <i>Tyro</i>
  represents the Lat. ablative in 'Apollonius de Tyro.' This story, like
  that of Canacee (note to l. 78), is told by Gower, Conf. Amant. bk.
  viii., ed. Pauli, iii. 284; and here again Chaucer seems to reflect upon
  Gower. The story occurs in the Gesta Romanorum, in which it appears as
  Tale cliii., being the longest story in the whole collection. It is
  remarkable as being the only really romantic story extant in an
  Anglo-Saxon version; see Thorpe's edition of it, London, 1834. It is
  therefore much older than 1190, the earliest date assigned by Warton.
  Compare the play of Pericles, Prince of Tyre.</p>

  <p>89. <i>if that I may</i>, as far as lies in my power (to do as I
  please); a common expletive phrase, of no great force.</p>

  <p>90. <i>of</i>, as to, with regard to. <i>doon</i>, accomplish it.</p>

  <p>92. <i>Pierides</i>; Tyrwhitt rightly says&mdash;'He rather means, I
  think, the <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>[141]</span>daughters of Pierus, that contended with
  the Muses, and were changed into pies; Ovid, Metam. bk. v.' Yet the
  expression is not wrong; it signifies&mdash;'I do not wish to be likened
  to those <i>would-be</i> Muses, the Pierides'; in other words, I do not
  set myself up as worthy to be considered a poet.</p>

  <p>93. <i>Metamorphoseos.</i> It was common to cite books thus, by a
  title in the <i>genitive case</i>, since the word <i>Liber</i> was
  understood. There is, however, a slight error in this substitution of the
  singular for the plural; the true title being P. Ovidii Nasonis
  Metamorphoseon Libri Quindecim. See the use of <i>Eneydos</i> in the
  Nonne Prestes Tale, B. 4549; and of <i>Judicum</i> in Monk. Ta. B.
  3236.</p>

  <p>94. 'But, nevertheless, I care not a bean.' Cf. l. 4004 below.</p>

  <p>95. <i>with hawe bake</i>, with plain fare, as Dr. Morris explains it;
  it obviously means something of a humble character, unsuited for a
  refined taste. This was left unexplained by Tyrwhitt, but we may fairly
  translate it literally by 'with a baked haw,' i.&nbsp;e. something that could
  just be eaten by a very hungry person. The expression <i>I sette nat an
  hawe</i> (= I care not a haw) occurs in the Wyf of Bathes Prologue, D.
  659. <i>Haws</i> are mentioned as given to feed hogs in the Vision of
  Piers Plowman, B. x. 10; but in The Romance of William of Palerne, l.
  1811, a lady actually tells her lover that they can live in the woods on
  <i>haws</i>, hips, acorns, and hazel-nuts. There is a somewhat similar
  passage in the Legend of Good Women, Prol. ll. 73-77. I see no difficulty
  in this explanation. That proposed by Mr. Jephson&mdash;'hark
  back'&mdash;is out of the question; we cannot rime <i>bak</i> with
  <i>makë</i>, nor does it make sense.</p>

  <p><i>Baken</i> was a strong verb in M.&nbsp;E., with the pp. <i>baken</i> or
  <i>bake</i> (A. S. <i>bacen</i>). Dr. Stratmann, apparently by mistake,
  enters this phrase under <i>hawe</i>, adj. dark grey! But he refrains
  from explaining <i>bake</i>.</p>

  <p>96. <i>I speke in prose</i>, I generally have to speak in prose in the
  law courts; so that if my tale is prosy as compared with Chaucer's, it is
  only what you would expect. Dr. Furnivall suggests that perhaps the prose
  tale of Melibeus was originally meant to be assigned to the Man of Lawe.
  See further in vol. iii. p. 406.</p>

  <p>98. <i>after</i>, afterwards, immediately hereafter. Cf. <i>other</i>
  for <i>otherwise</i> in Old English.&mdash;M.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Prologue to the Man of Lawes Tale.</b></p>

  <p>99-121. It is important to observe that more than three stanzas of
  this Prologue are little else than a translation from the treatise by
  Pope Innocent III. entitled De Contemptu Mundi, sive de Miseria
  Conditionis Humanae. This was first pointed out by Prof. Lounsbury, of
  Yale, Newhaven, U.S.A., in the <i>Nation</i>, July 4, 1889. He shewed
  that the lost work by Chaucer (viz. his translation of 'the Wreched
  Engendring of Mankinde As man may in Pope Innocent y-finde,' mentioned in
  the Legend of Good Women, Prologue A, l. 414) is not lost altogether,
  <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page142"></a>[142]</span>since we find traces of it in the first
  four stanzas of the present Prologue; in the stanzas of the Man of Lawes
  Tale which begin, respectively, with lines 421, 771, 925, and 1135; and
  in some passages in the Pardoner's Prologue; as will be pointed out.</p>

  <p>It will be observed that if Chaucer, as is probable, has preserved
  extracts from this juvenile work of his without much alteration, it must
  have been originally composed in seven-line stanzas, like his Second
  Nonnes Tale and Man of Lawes Tale.</p>

  <p>I here transcribe the original of the present passage from Innocent's
  above-named treatise, lib. i. c. 16, marking the places where the stanzas
  begin.</p>

  <p><i>De miseria divitis et pauperis.</i> (99) Pauperes enim premuntur
  inedia, cruciantur aerumna, fame, siti, frigore, nuditate; vilescunt,
  tabescunt, spernuntur, et confunduntur. O miserabilis mendicantis
  conditio; et si petit, pudore confunditur, et si non petit, egestate
  consumitur, sed ut mendicet, necessitate compellitur. (106) Deum causatur
  iniquum, quod non recte dividat; proximum criminatur malignum, quod non
  plene subveniat. Indignatur, murmurat, imprecatur. (113) Adverte super
  hoc sententiam Sapientis, 'Melius est,' inquit, 'mori quam indigere':
  'Etiam proximo suo pauper odiosus erit.' 'Omnes dies pauperis mali';
  (120) 'fratres hominis pauperis oderunt eum; insuper et amici procul
  recesserunt ab eo.'</p>

  <p>For further references to the quotations occurring in the above
  passage, see the notes below, to ll. 114, 118, 120.</p>

  <p>99. <i>poverte</i> = <i>povértë</i>, with the accent on the second
  syllable, as it rimes with <i>herte</i>; in the Wyf of Bathes Tale, it
  rimes with <i>sherte</i>. Poverty is here personified, and addressed by
  the Man of Lawe. The whole passage is illustrated by a similar long
  passage near the end of the Wyf of Bathes Tale, in which the opposite
  side of the question is considered, and the poet shews what can be said
  in Poverty's praise. See D. 1177-1206.</p>

  <p>101. <i>Thee</i> is a dative, like <i>me</i> in l. 91.&mdash;M. See
  Gen. ii. 15 (A. S. version), where <i>him þæs ne sceamode</i> = they were
  not ashamed of it; lit. it shamed them not of it.</p>

  <p>102. <i>artow</i>, art thou; the words being run together: so also
  <i>seistow</i> = sayest thou, in l. 110.</p>

  <p>104. <i>Maugree thyn heed</i>, in spite of all you can do; lit.
  despite thy head; see Knightes Tale, A. 1169, 2618, D. 887.</p>

  <p>105. <i>Or ... or</i> = either ... or; an early example of this
  construction.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>108. <i>neighebour</i> is a trisyllable; observe that <i>e</i> in the
  middle of a word is frequently sounded; cf. l. 115. <i>wytest</i>,
  blamest.</p>

  <p>110. 'By my faith, sayest thou, he will have to account for it
  hereafter, when his tail shall burn in the fire (lit. glowing coal),
  because he helps not the needy in their necessity.'</p>

  <p>114. 'It is better (for thee) to die than be in need.' Tyrwhitt
  says&mdash;'This saying of Solomon is quoted in the Romaunt of the Rose,
  <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>[143]</span>l. 8573&mdash;Mieux vault mourir que
  pauvres estre'; [l. 8216, ed. Méon.] The quotation is not from Solomon,
  but from Jesus, son of Sirach; see Ecclus. xl. 28, where the Vulgate
  has&mdash;'Melius est enim mori quam indigere.' Cf. B. 2761.</p>

  <p>115. <i>Thy selve neighebor</i>, thy very neighbour, even thy next
  neighbour. See note to l. 108.</p>

  <p>118. In Prov. xv. 15, the Vulgate version has&mdash;'Omnes dies
  <i>pauperis</i> mali'; where the A. V. has 'the afflicted.'</p>

  <p>119. The reading <i>to</i> makes the line harsh, as the final <i>e</i>
  in <i>come</i> should be sounded, and therefore needs elision. <i>in that
  prikke</i>, into that point, into that condition; cf. l. 1028.</p>

  <p>120. Cf. Prov. xiv. 20&mdash;'the poor is hated even of his
  neighbour'; or, in the Vulgate, 'Etiam proximo suo pauper odiosus erit.'
  Also Prov. xix. 7&mdash;'all the brethren of the poor do hate him; how
  much more do his friends go far from him'; or, in the Vulgate, 'Fratres
  hominis pauperis oderunt eum; insuper et amici procul recesserunt ab eo.'
  So too Ovid, Trist. i. 9. 5:&mdash;</p>

      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Chaucer has the same thought again in his Tale of Melibeus (p. 227, B.
  2749)&mdash;'and if thy fortune change, that thou wexe povre, farewel
  freendshipe and felaweshipe!' See also note to B. 3436.</p>

  <p>123. <i>as in this cas</i>, as relates to this condition or lot in
  life. In Chaucer, <i>cas</i> often means <i>chance</i>, <i>hap</i>.</p>

  <p>124. <i>ambes as</i>, double aces, two aces, in throwing dice.
  <i>Ambes</i> is Old French for <i>both</i>, from Lat. <i>ambo</i>. The
  line in the Monkes Tale&mdash;'Thy <i>sys</i> fortune hath turned into
  <i>as</i>' (B. 3851)&mdash;helps us out here in some measure, as it
  proves that a six was reckoned as a good throw, but an ace as a bad one.
  So in Shakespeare, Mids. Nt. Dream, v. 1. 314, we find <i>less than an
  ace</i> explained as equivalent to <i>nothing</i>. In the next line,
  <i>sis cink</i> means <i>a six and a five</i>, which was often a winning
  throw. The allusion is probably, however, not to the mere attempt as to
  which of two players could throw the highest, but to the particular game
  called <i>hazard</i>, in which the word <i>chance</i> (here used) has a
  special sense. There is a good description of it in the Supplemental
  volume to the English Cyclopaedia, div. Arts and Sciences. The whole
  description has to be read, but it may suffice to say here that, when the
  caster is going to throw, he <i>calls a main</i>, or names one of the
  numbers five, six, seven, eight, or nine; most often, he calls seven. If
  he then throws either seven or eleven (Chaucer's <i>sis cink</i>), he
  wins; if he throws aces (Chaucer's <i>ambes as</i>) or deuce-ace (two and
  one), or double sixes, he loses. If he throws some other number, that
  number is called the caster's <i>chance</i>, and he goes on playing till
  either the main or the chance turns up. In the first case he loses, in
  the second, he wins. If he calls some other number, the winning and
  losing throws are somewhat varied; but in all cases, the double ace is a
  losing throw. <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page144"></a>[144]</span></p>

  <p>Similarly, in The Pardoneres Tale, where <i>hazard</i> is mentioned by
  name (C. 591), we find, at l. 653&mdash;'Seven is my chaunce, and thyn is
  cinq and treye,' i.&nbsp;e. eight.</p>

  <p>In Lydgate's Order of Fools, printed in Queen Elizabeth's Academy, ed.
  Furnivall, p. 81, one fool is described&mdash;</p>

  <p>And in a ballad printed in Chaucer's Works, ed. 1561, folio 340, back,

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The phrase was already used proverbially before Chaucer's time. In the
  metrical Life of St. Brandan, ed. T. Wright, p. 23, we find, 'hi caste an
  <i>ambes as</i>,' they cast double aces, i.&nbsp;e. they wholly failed. See
  <i>Ambs-ace</i> in the New E. Dict. Dr. Morris notes that the phrase
  'aums ace' occurs in Hazlitt's O.&nbsp;E. Plays, ii. 35, with the editorial
  remark&mdash;'not mentioned elsewhere' (!).</p>

  <p>126. <i>At Cristemasse</i>, even at Christmas, when the severest
  weather comes. In olden times, severe cold must have tried the poor even
  more than it does now.</p>

  <i>thorient</i>, B. 3871.</p>

  <p>129. <i>fadres</i>, fathers, originators; by bringing tidings from
  afar.</p>

  <p>130. <i>debat</i>, strife. Merchants, being great travellers, were
  expected to pick up good stories.</p>

  <p>131. <i>were</i>, should be. <i>desolat</i>, destitute. 'The E. E.
  word is <i>westi</i>; 'westi of alle gode theawes,' destitute of all good
  virtues; O. Eng. Homilies, i. 285.'&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>132. <i>Nere</i>, for <i>ne were</i>, were it not. <i>goon is,

<p class="ac"><b>The Tale of the Man of Lawe.</b></p>

  <p>A story, agreeing closely with The Man of Lawes Tale, is found in Book
  II. of Gower's Confessio Amantis, from which Tyrwhitt supposed that
  Chaucer borrowed it. But Gower's version seems to be later than
  Chaucer's, whilst Chaucer and Gower were both alike indebted to the
  version of the story in French prose (by Nicholas Trivet) in MS. Arundel
  56, printed for the Chaucer Society in 1872. In some places Chaucer
  agrees with this French version rather closely, but he makes variations
  and additions at pleasure. Cf. vol. iii. p. 409.</p>

  <p>The first ninety-eight lines of the preceding Prologue are written in
  couplets, in order to link the Tale to the others of the series; but
  there is nothing to show which of the other tales it was intended to
  follow. Next follows a more special Prologue of thirty-five lines, in
  five stanzas of seven lines each; so that the first line in the Tale is
  l. 134 of Group B, the second of the fragments into which the Canterbury
  Tales are broken up, owing to the incomplete state in which Chaucer left
  them.</p>

  <p>134. <i>Surrie</i>, Syria; called <i>Sarazine</i> (Saracen-land) by N.
  Trivet.</p>

  <p>136. <i>spycerye</i>, grocery, &amp;c., lit. spicery. The old name for
  a grocer was a <i>spicer</i>; and <i>spicery</i> was a wide term. 'It
  should be noted that the Ital. <i>spezerie</i> included a vast deal more
  than ginger and other "things hot i' the mouth." In one of Pegoletti's
  lists of <i>spezerie</i> we find drugs, dye-stuffs, metals, wax, cotton,'
  &amp;c.&mdash;Note by Col. Yule in his ed. of Marco Polo; on bk. i. c.
  1.</p>

  <p>143. <i>Were</i> it, whether it were.</p>

  <p>144. <i>message</i>, messenger, <i>not</i> message; see l. 333, and
  the note.</p>

  <p>145. The final <i>e</i> in <i>Rome</i> is pronounced, as in l. 142;
  but the words <i>the ende</i> are to be run together, forming but
  <i>one</i> syllable, <i>thende</i>, according to Chaucer's usual
  practice; cf. note to l. 255. Indeed in ll. 423, 965, it is actually so
  spelt; just as, in l. 150, we have <i>thexcellent</i>, and in l. 151,
  <i>themperoures</i>.</p>

  <p>151. <i>themperoures</i>, the emperor's. Gower calls him Tiberius
  Constantine, who was Emperor (not of Rome, but) of the East, <span
  class="sm">A. D.</span> 578, and was succeeded, as in the story, by
  Maurice, <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 582. His capital was
  Constantinople, whither merchants from Syria could easily repair; but the
  greater fame of Rome caused the substitution of the Western for the
  Eastern capital.</p>

  <p>156. <i>God him see</i>, God protect him. See note to C. 715.</p>

  <p>161. <i>al Europe.</i> In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. Cp. Pt. Ln. is
  written the note 'Europa est tercia pars mundi.'</p>

  <p>166. <i>mirour</i>, mirror. Such French words are frequently accented
  on the <i>last</i> syllable. Cf. <i>minístr'</i> in l. 168.</p>

  <p>171. <i>han doon fraught</i>, have caused to be freighted. All the
  MSS. have <i>fraught</i>, not <i>fraughte</i>. In the Glossary to
  Specimens of English, I marked <i>fraught</i> as being the infinitive
  mood, as Dr. Stratmann <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>[146]</span>supposes, though he notes the lack of the
  final <i>e</i>. I have now no doubt that <i>fraught</i> is nothing but
  the past participle, as in William of Palerne, l. 2732&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And feithliche <i>fraught</i> ful of fine wines,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>which is said of a ship. The use of this past participle after a
  <i>perfect</i> tense is a most remarkable idiom, but there is no doubt
  about its occurrence in the Clerkes Tale, Group E. 1098, where we find
  'Hath doon yow <i>kept</i>,' where Tyrwhitt has altered <i>kept</i> to
  <i>kepe</i>. On the other hand, Tyrwhitt actually notes the occurrence of
  'Hath don <i>wroght</i>' in Kn. Tale, 1055, (A. 1913), which he calls an
  irregularity. A better name for it is idiom. I find similar instances of
  it in another author of the same period,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Thai strak his hed of, and syne it</p>
      <p>Thai <i>haf gert saltit</i> in-til a kyt.'</p>
      <p style="margin-left:4.4em">Barbour's Bruce, ed. Skeat, xviii. 167.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I.&nbsp;e. they have caused it (to be) salted. And again in the same, bk.
  viii. l. 13, we have the expression <i>He gert held</i>, as if 'he caused
  to be held'; but it may mean 'he caused to incline.' Compare also the
  following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And thai sall <i>let thame trumpit</i> ill'; id. xix. 712.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I.&nbsp;e. and they shall consider themselves as evilly deceived.</p>

  <p>In the Royal Wills, ed. Nichols, p. 278, we find:&mdash;'wher I have
  beforn ordeyned and <i>do mad</i> [caused to be made] my tombe.'</p>

  <p>The infinitive appears to have been <i>fraughten</i>, though the
  earliest certain examples of this form seem to be those in Shakespeare,
  Cymb. i. 1. 126, Temp. i. 2. 13. The proper form of the pp. was
  <i>fraughted</i> (as in Marlowe, 2 Tamb. i. 2. 33), but the loss of final
  <i><span class="nw">-ed</span></i> in past participles of verbs of which
  the stem ends in <i>t</i> is common; cf. <i>set</i>, <i>put</i>, &amp;c.
  Hence this form <i>fraught</i> as a pp. in the present instance. It is a
  Scandinavian word, from Swed. <i>frakta</i>, Dan. <i>fragte</i>. At a
  later period we find <i>freight</i>, the mod. E. form. The vowel-change
  is due to the fact that there was an intermediate form <i>fret</i>,
  borrowed from the French form <i>fret</i> of the Scandinavian word. This
  form <i>fret</i> disturbed the vowel-sound, without wholly destroying the
  recollection of the original guttural <i>gh</i>, due to the Swed.
  <i>k</i>. For an example of <i>fret</i>, we have only to consult the old
  black-letter editions of Chaucer printed in 1532 and 1561, which give us
  the present line in the form&mdash;'These marchantes han don <i>fret</i>
  her ships new.'</p>

  <p>185. <i>ceriously</i>, 'seriously,' i.&nbsp;e. with great minuteness of
  detail. Used by Fabyan, who says that 'to reherce <i>ceryously</i>' all
  the conquests of Henry V would fill a volume; Chron., ed. Ellis, p. 589.
  Skelton, in his Garland of Laurell, l. 581, has: 'And <i>seryously</i>
  she shewyd me ther denominacyons'; on which Dyce remarks that it means
  <i>seriatim</i>, and gives a clear example. It answers to the Low Latin
  <i>seriose</i>, used in two senses; (1) seriously, gravely; (2) minutely,
  <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page147"></a>[147]</span>fully. In the latter case it is perhaps to
  be referred to the Lat. <i>series</i>, not <i>serius</i>. A similar word,
  <i>cereatly</i> (Lat. <i>seriatim</i>), is found three times in the
  Romance of Partenay, ed. Skeat, with the sense of <i>in due order</i>;
  cf. <i>Ceriatly</i> and <i>Ceryows</i> in the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>In N. and Q. 7 S. xii. 183, I shewed that Lydgate has at least
  <i>ten</i> examples of this use of the word in his Siege of Troye. In one
  instance it is spelt <i>seryously</i> (with <i>s</i>).</p>

  <p>190. This refers to the old belief in astrology and the casting of
  nativities. Cf. Prol. A. 414-418. Observe that ll. 190-203 are not in the
  original, and were doubtless added in revision. This is why <i>this
  sowdan</i> in l. 186 is so far separated from the repetition of the same
  words in l. 204.</p>

  <p>197. Tyrwhitt shews that this stanza is imitated closely from some
  Latin lines, some of which are quoted in the margin of many MSS. of
  Chaucer. He quotes them at length from the Megacosmos of Bernardus
  Silvestris, a poet of the twelfth century (extant in MS. Bodley 1265).
  The lines are as follows, it being premised that those printed in italics
  are cited in the margin of MSS. E. Hn. Cp. Pt. and Ln.:&mdash;</p>

  <p>See Bernardi Sylvestris Megacosmos, ed. C.S. Barach and J. Wrobel,
  Innsbruck, 1876, p. 16. The names <i>Ector</i> (Hector), &amp;c., are too
  well known to require comment. The death of Turnus is told at the end of
  Vergil's Æneid.</p>

  <p>207, 208. Here <i>have</i>, forming part of the phrase <i>mighte have
  grace</i>, is unemphatic, whilst <i>han</i> (for <i>haven</i>) is
  emphatic, and signifies possession. See <i>han</i> again in l. 241.</p>

  <p>211. Compare Squieres Tale, F. 202, 203, and the note thereon.</p>

  <p>224. <i>Mahoun</i>, Mahomet. The French version does not mention
  Mahomet. This is an anachronism on Chaucer's part; the Emperor Tiberius
  II. died <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 582, when Mahomet was but twelve
  years old.</p>

  <p>228. <i>I prey yow holde</i>, I pray you to hold. Here <i>holde</i> is
  the infinitive mood. The imperative plural would be <i>holdeth</i>; see
  <i>saveth</i>, next line. <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>[148]</span></p>

  <p>236. <i>Maumettrye</i>, idolatry; from the Mid. E. <i>maumet</i>, an
  idol, corrupted from Mahomet. The confusion introduced by using the word
  <i>Mahomet</i> for an idol may partly account for the anachronism in l.
  224. The Mahometans were falsely supposed by our forefathers to be
  idolaters.</p>

  <p>242. <i>noot</i>, equivalent to <i>ne woot</i>, know not.</p>

  <p>248. <i>gret-è</i> forms the fourth foot in the line. If we read
  <i>gret</i>, the line is left imperfect at the cæsura; and we should have
  to scan it with a medial pause, as thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>253. 'So, when Ethelbert married Bertha, daughter of the Christian
  King Charibert, she brought with her, to the court of her husband, a
  Gallican bishop named Leudhard, who was permitted to celebrate mass in
  the ancient British Church of St. Martin, at Canterbury.'&mdash;Note in
  Bell's Chaucer.</p>

  <p>255. <i>ynowe</i>, being plural, takes a final <i>e</i>; we then read
  <i>th'ende</i>, as explained in note to l. 145. The pl.
  <i>ino&#x21D;he</i> occurs in the Ormulum.</p>

  <p>263. <i>alle and some</i>, collectively and individually; one and all.
  See Cler. Tale, E. 941, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>273-87. Not in the original; perhaps added in revision.</p>

  <p>277. The word <i>alle</i>, being plural, is dissyllabic. <i>Thing</i>
  is often a plural form, being an A.&nbsp;S. neuter noun. The words
  <i>over</i>, <i>ever</i>, <i>never</i> are, in Chaucer, generally
  monosyllables, or nearly so; just as <i>o'er</i>, <i>e'er</i>,
  <i>ne'er</i> are treated as monosyllables by our poets in general. Hence
  the scansion is&mdash;'Ov'r al | lë thing |,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>289. The word <i>at</i> is inserted from the Cambridge MS.; all the
  other six MSS. omit it, which makes the passage one of extreme
  difficulty. Tyrwhitt reads 'Or Ylion brent, or Thebes the citee.' Of
  course he means <i>brende</i>, past tense, not <i>brent</i>, the past
  participle; and his conjecture amounts to inserting <i>or</i> before
  Thebes. It is better to insert <i>at</i>, as in MS. Cm.; see Gilman's
  edition. The sense is&mdash;'When Pyrrhus broke the wall, before Ilium
  burnt, (nor) at the city of Thebes, nor at Rome,' &amp;c. <i>Nat</i> (l.
  290) = <i>Ne at</i>, as in Hl. <i>Ylion</i>, in medieval romance, meant
  'the citadel' of Troy; see my note to l. 936 of the Legend of Good Women.
  Tyrwhitt well observes that 'Thebes the citee' is a French phrase. He
  quotes 'dedans Renes <i>la cite</i>,' Froissart, v. i. c. 225.</p>

  <p>295-315. Not in the original, and clearly a later addition. They
  include an allusion to Boethius (see next note).</p>

  <p>295. In the margin of the Ellesmere MS. is written&mdash;'Vnde
  Ptholomeus, libro i. cap. 8. Primi motus celi duo sunt, quorum vnus est
  qui mouet totum semper ab Oriente in Occidentem vno modo super orbes,
  &amp;c. Item aliter vero motus est qui mouet orbem stellarum currencium
  <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>[149]</span>contra motum primum, videlicet, ab
  Occidente in Orientem super alios duos polos.' The old astronomy imagined
  nine spheres revolving round the central stationary earth; of the seven
  innermost, each carried with it one of the seven planets, viz. the Moon,
  Venus, Mercury, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; the eighth sphere, that
  of the fixed stars, had a slow motion from west to east, round the axis
  of the zodiac (<i>super alios duos polos</i>), to account for the
  precession of the equinoxes; whilst the ninth or outermost sphere, called
  the <i>primum mobile</i>, or the sphere of first motion, had a diurnal
  revolution from east to west, carrying everything with it. This exactly
  corresponds with Chaucer's language. He addresses the outermost sphere or
  <i>primum mobile</i> (which is the <i>ninth</i> if reckoning from within,
  but the <i>first</i> from without), and accuses it of carrying with it
  everything in its irresistible westward motion; a motion contrary to that
  of the 'natural' motion, viz. that in which the sun advances along the
  signs of the zodiac. The result was that the evil influence of the planet
  Mars prevented the marriage. It is clear that Chaucer was thinking of
  certain passages in Boethius, as will appear from consulting his own
  translation of Boethius, ed. Morris, pp. 21, 22, 106, and 110. I quote a
  few lines to shew this:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'O þou maker of þe whele þat bereþ þe sterres, whiche þat art fastned
  to þi perdurable chayere, and turnest þe heuene wiþ a rauyssyng
  <i>sweighe</i>, and constreinest þe sterres to suffren þi lawe'; pp. 21,

  <p>299. <i>crowding</i>, pushing. This is still a familiar word in East
  <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>[150]</span>Anglia. Forby, in his Glossary of the East
  Anglian Dialect, says&mdash;'<i>Crowd</i>, v. to push, shove, or press
  close. To the word, in its <i>common</i> acceptation, <i>number</i> seems
  necessary. With us, <i>one</i> individual can <i>crowd</i> another.' To
  <i>crowd</i> a wheelbarrow means to push it. The expression '<i>crod</i>
  in a barwe,' i.&nbsp;e. wheeled or pushed along in a wheelbarrow, occurs in
  the Paston Letters, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1477, ed. Gairdner, iii.
  215.</p>

  <p>302. A planet is said to ascend directly, when in a direct sign; but
  tortuously, when in a tortuous sign. The tortuous signs are those which
  ascend most obliquely to the horizon, viz. the signs from Capricornus to
  Gemini inclusive. Chaucer tells us this <i>himself</i>; see his Treatise
  on the Astrolabe, part ii. sect. 28, in vol. iii. The most 'tortuous' of
  these are the two middle ones, Pisces and Aries. Of these two, Aries is
  called the mansion of Mars, and we may therefore suppose the ascending
  sign to be Aries, the lord of which (Mars) is said to have fallen 'from
  his angle into the darkest house.' The words 'angle' and 'house' are used
  technically. The whole zodiacal circle was divided into twelve equal
  parts, or 'houses.' Of these, four (beginning from the cardinal points)
  were termed 'angles,' four others (next following them) 'succedents,' and
  the rest 'cadents.' It appears that Mars was not then situate in an
  'angle,' but in his 'darkest (i.&nbsp;e. darker) house.' Mars had <i>two</i>
  houses, Aries and Scorpio. The latter is here meant; Aries being the
  ascendent sign, Scorpio was below the horizon, and beyond the western
  'angle.'</p>

  <p>Now Scorpio was 'called the house of death, and of trauaile, of harm,
  and of domage, of strife, of battaile, of guilefulnesse and falsnesse,
  and of wit'; Batman upon Bartholomè, lib. viii. c. 17. We may represent
  the position of Mars by the following table, where <i>East</i> represents
  the <i>ascending</i> sign, <i>West</i> the <i>descending</i> sign; and
  A., S., and C. stand for 'angle,' 'succedent,' and 'cadent house'
  respectively.</p>

  <p>Again, the 'darkest house' was sometimes considered to be the
  <i>eighth</i>; though authorities varied. This again points to
  Scorpio.</p>

  <p>'Nulla diuisio circuli tam pessima, tamque crudelis in omnibus, quam
  octaua est.'&mdash;Aphorismi Astrologi Ludovici de Rigiis; sect. 35. I
  may also note here, that in Lydgate's Siege of Troy, ed. 1555, fol. Y 4,
  there is a long passage on the evil effects of Mars in the 'house' of
  Scorpio.</p>

  <p>305. The meaning of <i>Atazir</i> has long remained undiscovered. But
  by the kind help of Mr. Bensly, one of the sub-librarians of the
  Cambridge University Library, I am enabled to explain it. <i>Atazir</i>
  or <i>atacir</i> is the Spanish spelling of the Arabic <i>al-tasir</i>,
  influence, given at p. 351 of Richardson's Pers. Dict., ed. 1829. It is a
  noun derived from <i>asara</i>, a verb of the second conjugation, meaning
  to leave a mark <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>[151]</span>on, from the substantive <i>asar</i>, a
  mark; the latter substantive is given at p. 20 of the same work. Its use
  in astrology is commented upon by Dozy, who gives it in the form
  <i>atacir</i>, in his Glossaire des Mots Espagnols dérivés de l'Arabique,
  p. 207. It signifies the <i>influence</i> of a star or planet upon other
  stars, or upon the fortunes of men. In the present case it is clearly
  used in a bad sense; we may therefore translate it by 'evil influence,'
  i.&nbsp;e. the influence of Mars in the house of Scorpio. On this common
  deterioration in the meaning of words, see Trench, Study of Words, p. 52.
  The word <i>craft</i>, for example, is a very similar instance; it
  originally meant <i>skill</i>, and hence, a trade, and we find
  <i>star-craft</i> used in particular to signify the science of
  astronomy.</p>

  <p>307. 'Thou art in conjunction in an unfavourable position; from the
  position in which thou wast favourably placed thou art moved away.' This
  I take to mean that the Moon (as well as Mars) was in Scorpio; hence
  their conjunction. But Scorpio was called the Moon's <i>depression</i>,
  being the sign in which her influence was least favourable; she was
  therefore 'not well received,' i.&nbsp;e., not supported by a lucky planet, or
  by a planet in a lucky position. <i>weyved</i>, pushed aside.</p>

  <p>312. 'Is there no choice as to when to fix the voyage?' The favourable
  moment for commencing a voyage was one of the points on which it was
  considered desirable to have an astrologer's opinion. Travelling, at that
  time, was a serious matter. Yet this was only one of the many
  undertakings which required, as was thought, to be begun at a favourable
  moment. Whole books were written on 'elections,' i.&nbsp;e. favourable times
  for commencing operations of all kinds. Chaucer was thinking, in
  particular, of the following passage, which is written in the margins of
  the Ellesmere and Hengwrt MSS.: 'Omnes concordati sunt quod elecciones
  sint debiles nisi in diuitibus: habent enim isti, licet debilitentur
  eorum elecciones, radicem, i. [<i>id est</i>] natiuitates eorum, que
  confortat omnem planetam debilem in itinere.' The sense of which
  is&mdash;'For all are agreed, that "elections" are weak, except in the
  case of the rich; for these, although their elections be weakened, have a
  "root" of their own, that is to say, their nativities (<i>or</i>
  horoscopes); which root strengthens every planet that is of weak
  influence with respect to a journey.' This is extracted, says Tyrwhitt,
  from a Liber Electionum by a certain Zael; see MS. Harl. 80; MS. Bodley
  1648. This is a very fair example of the jargon to be found in old books
  on astrology. The old astrologers used to alter their predictions almost
  at pleasure, by stating that their results depended on several causes,
  which partly counteracted one another; an arrangement of which the
  convenience is obvious. Thus, if the aspect of the planets at the time
  inquired about appeared to be adverse to a journey, it might still be the
  case (they said) that such evil aspect might be overcome by the fortunate
  aspect of the inquirer's horoscope; or, conversely, an ill aspect in the
  horoscope could be counteracted by a fit election of a time for action. A
  rich man would probably be fitted with a fortunate <!-- Page 152 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>[152]</span>horoscope, or else why
  should he buy one? Such horoscope depended on the aspect of the heavens
  at the time of birth or 'nativity,' and, in particular, upon the
  'ascendent' at that time; i.&nbsp;e. upon the planets lying nearest to the
  point of the zodiac which happened, at that moment, to be
  <i>ascending</i>, i.&nbsp;e. just appearing above the horizon. So Chaucer, in
  his Treatise on the Astrolabe, pt. ii. § 4, (vol. iii. 191), explains the
  matter, saying&mdash;'The assendent sothly, as wel in alle nativitez as
  in questiouns and <i>elecciouns of tymes</i>, is a thing which that thise
  Astrologiens gretly observen'; &amp;c. The curious reader may find much
  more to the same effect in the same Treatise, with directions to 'make
  roots' in pt. ii. § 44.</p>

  <p>The curious may further consult the Epitome Astrologiae of Johannes
  Hispalensis. The whole of Book iv. of that work is 'De Electionibus,' and
  the title of cap. xv. is 'Pro Itinere.'</p>

  <p>Lydgate, in his Siege of Thebes, just at the beginning, describes the
  astronomers as casting the horoscope of the infant &OElig;dipus. They
  were expected</p>

  <p>To take a different example, Ashmole, in his Theatrum Chemicum, 1652,
  says in a note on p. 450&mdash;'Generally in all Elections the Efficacy
  of the Starrs are (<i>sic</i>) used, as it were by a certaine application
  made thereof to those unformed Natures that are to be wrought upon;
  whereby to further the working thereof, and make them more available to
  our purpose.... And by such Elections as good use may be made of the
  Celestiall influences, as a Physitian doth of the variety of herbes....
  But Nativities are the Radices of Elections, and therefore we ought
  chiefly to looke backe upon them as the principal Root and Foundation of
  all Operations; and next to them the quality of the Thing we intend to
  fit must be respected, so that, by an apt position of Heaven, and
  fortifying the Planets and Houses in the Nativity of the Operator, and
  making them agree with the thing signified, the impression made by that
  influence will abundantly augment the Operation,' &amp;c.; with much more
  to the same effect. Several passages in Norton's Ordinall, printed in the
  same volume (see pp. 60, 100), shew clearly what is meant by Chaucer in
  his Prologue, ll. 415-7. The Doctor could 'fortune the ascendent of his
  images,' by choosing a favourable moment for the making of charms in the
  form of images, when a suitable planet was in the ascendent. Cf. Troil.
  ii. 74.</p>

  <p>314. <i>rote</i> is the astrological term for the epoch from which to
  reckon. The exact moment of a nativity being known, the astrologers were
  supposed to be able to calculate everything else. See the last note.</p>

  <p>332. <i>Alkaron</i>, the Koran; <i>al</i> is the Arabic article. <!--
  Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>[153]</span></p>

  <p>333. Here <i>Makomete</i> is used instead of <i>Mahoun</i> (l. 224).
  See Washington Irving's Life of Mahomet.</p>

  <p><i>message</i>, messenger. This is a correct form, according to the
  usages of Middle English; cf. l. 144. In like manner, we find
  <i>prison</i> used to mean a <i>prisoner</i>, which is often puzzling at
  first sight.</p>

  <p>340. 'Because we denied Mahomet, our (object of) belief.'</p>

  <p>360. 'O serpent under the form of woman, like that Serpent that is
  bound in hell.' The allusion here is not a little curious. It clearly
  refers to the old belief that the serpent who tempted Eve appeared to her
  <i>with a woman's head</i>, and it is sometimes so represented. I
  observed it, for instance, in the chapter-house of Salisbury Cathedral;
  and see the woodcut at p. 73 of Wright's History of Caricature and
  Grotesque in Art. In Peter Comestor's Historia Libri Genesis, we read of
  Satan&mdash;'Elegit etiam quoddam genus serpentis (vt ait Beda)
  <i>virgineum vultum</i> habens.' In the alliterative Troy Book, ed.
  Panton and Donaldson, p. 144, the Tempter is called Lyuyaton (i.&nbsp;e.
  Leviathan), and it is said of him that he</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And, again, in Piers the Plowman, B. xviii. 355, Satan is compared to
  a 'lusarde [lizard] <i>with a lady visage</i>.' In the Ancren Riwle, p.
  207, we are gravely informed that a scorpion is a kind of serpent that
  has a face somewhat like that of a woman, and puts on a pleasant
  countenance. To remember this gives peculiar force to ll. 370, 371. See
  also note to l. 404.</p>

  <p>367. <i>knowestow</i> is a trisyllable; and <i>the olde</i> is to be
  read <i>tholdè</i>. But in l. 371, the word <i>Makestow</i>, being
  differently placed in the line, is to be read with the <i>e</i> slurred
  over, as a dissyllable.</p>

  <p>380. <i>moste</i>, might. It is not always used like the modern
  <i>must</i>.</p>

  <p>401. See Lucan's Pharsalia, iii. 79&mdash;'Perdidit o qualem uincendo
  plura triumphum!' But Chaucer's reference, evidently made at random, is
  unlucky. Lucan laments that he had no triumph to record.</p>

  <p>404. The line is deficient at the beginning, the word <i>But</i>
  standing by itself as a foot. So also in A. 294, G. 341, &amp;c. See
  Ellis's Early English Pronunciation, pp. 333, 649. (This peculiarity was
  pointed out by me in 1866, in the Aldine edition of Chaucer, i. 174.) For
  the sense of <i>scorpioun</i>, see the reference to the Ancren Riwle, in
  note to l. 360, and compare the following extracts. 'Thes is the
  scorpioun, thet maketh uayr mid the heauede, and enuenymeth mid the
  tayle'; Ayenbite of Inwyt, ed. Morris, p. 62. 'The scorpion, the whiche
  enoynteth with his tongue, and prycketh sore with his taylle'; Caxton,
  Fables of Æsop; Lib. iv. fable 3. Chaucer repeats the idea, somewhat more
  fully, in the Marchaunts Tale, E. 2058-2060. So also <i>this wikked
  gost</i> means this Evil Spirit, this Tempter.</p>

  <p>421. Pronounce <i>ever</i> rapidly, and accent <i>súccessour</i> on
  the first syllable. In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. Pt. and Cp. is the
  following <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>[154]</span>note: 'Nota, de inopinato dolore. Semper
  mundane leticie tristicia repentina succedit. Mundana igitur felicitas
  multis amaritudinibus est respersa. Extrema gaudii luctus occupat. Audi
  ergo salubre consilium; in die bonorum ne immemor sis malorum.' This is
  one of the passages from Innocent's treatise de Contemptu Mundi, of which
  I have already spoken in the note to B. 99-121 above (p. 140). Lib. i. c.
  23 has the heading&mdash;'De inopinato dolore.' It begins:&mdash;'Semper
  enim mundanae letitiae tristitia repentina succedit. Et quod incipit a
  gaudio, desinit in moerore. Mundana quippe felicitas multis
  amaritudinibus est respersa. Noverat hoc qui dixerat: "Risus dolore
  miscebitur, et extrema gaudii luctus occupat."... Attende salubrem
  consilium: "In die bonorum, non immemor sis malorum."'</p>

  <p>This passage is mostly made up of scraps taken from different authors.
  I find in Boethius, De Consolatione Philosophiae, lib. ii. pr.
  4&mdash;'Quam multis amaritudinibus humanae felicitatis dulcedo respersa
  est'; which Chaucer translates by&mdash;'The swetnesse of mannes
  welefulnesse is <i>sprayned with many biternesses</i>'; see vol. ii. p.
  34; and the same expression is repeated here, in l. 422. Gower quotes the
  same passage from Boethius in the prologue to his Confessio Amantis. The
  next sentence is from Prov. xiv. 13&mdash;'Risus dolore miscebitur, et
  extrema gaudii luctus occupat.' The last clause (see ll. 426, 427) is
  from Ecclesiasticus, xi. 27 (in the Vulgate version). Cf. Troil. iv.
  836.</p>

  <p>438. Compare Trivet's French prose version:&mdash;'Dount ele fist
  estorier vne neef de vitaile, de payn quest apele bisquit, &amp; de peis,
  &amp; de feues, de sucre, &amp; de meel, &amp; de vyn, pur sustenaunce de

  de homme.' I.&nbsp;e. 'Then she caused a ship to be stored with victuals, with
  bread that is called biscuit, with peas, beans, sugar, honey, and wine,
  to sustain the maiden's life for three years. And in this ship she caused
  to be placed the riches and treasure which the Emperor Tiberius had sent
  with the maid Constance his daughter; and in this ship the Sultaness
  caused the maiden to be put, without sail or oar, or any kind of human
  aid.'</p>

  <p><i>foot-hot</i>, hastily. It occurs in Gower, ed. Pauli, ii. 114; in
  The Romaunt of the Rose, l. 3827: Octovian, 1224, in Weber's Met. Rom.
  iii. 208; Sevyn Sages, 843, in the same, iii. 34; Richard Coer de Lion,
  1798, 2185, in the same, ii. 71, 86; and in Barbour's Bruce, iii. 418,
  xiii. 454. Compare the term <i>hot-trod</i>, explained by Sir W. Scott to
  mean the pursuit of marauders with bloodhounds: see note 3 H to the Lay
  of the Last Minstrel. We also find <i>hot fot</i>, i.&nbsp;e. immediately, in
  the Debate of the Body and the Soul, l. 481. It is a translation of the
  O. F. phrase <i>chalt pas</i>, immediately, examples of which are given
  by Godefroy.</p>

  <p>See the translation in Hymns Ancient and Modern, No. 97, part 2 (new

  <p>We come still nearer to the original of Chaucer's lines when we
  consider the form of prayer quoted in the Ancren Riwle, p. 34, which is
  there given as follows:&mdash;'Salue crux sancta, arbor digna, quae sola
  fuisti digna portare Regem celorum et Dominum.... O crux gloriosa! o crux
  adoranda! o lignum preciosum, et admirabile signum, per quod et diabolus
  est victus, et mundus Christi sanguine redemptus.'</p>

  <p>460. <i>him and here</i>, him and her, i.&nbsp;e. man and woman; as in
  Piers the Plowman, A. Pass. i. l. 100. The allusion is to the supposed
  power of the cross over evil spirits. See The Legends of the Holy Rood,
  ed. Morris; especially the story of the Invention of the Cross by St.
  Helen, p. 160&mdash;'And anone, as he had made the [sign of the] crosse,
  þe grete multitude of deuylles vanyshed awaye'; or, in the Latin
  original, 'statimque ut edidit signum crucis, omnis illa daemonum
  multitudo euanuit'; Aurea Legenda, ed. Grässe, 2nd ed. p. 311. Cf. Piers
  Plowman, B. xviii. 429-431.</p>

  <p>461. The reading of this line is certain, and must not be altered. But
  it is impossible to <i>parse</i> the line without at once noticing that
  there is some difficulty in the construction. The best solution is
  obtained by taking <i>which</i> in the sense of <i>whom</i>. A familiar
  example of this use of <i>which</i> for <i>who</i> occurs in the Lord's
  Prayer. See also Abbott's Shakespearian Grammar, Sect. 265. The
  construction is as follows&mdash;'O victorious tree, protection of true
  people, that alone wast worthy to bear the King of Heaven with His new
  wounds&mdash;the White Lamb that was hurt with the spear&mdash;O expeller
  of fiends out of both man and woman, on whom (i.&nbsp;e. the men and women on
  whom) thine arms faithfully spread out,' &amp;c. <i>Limes</i> means the
  arms of the cross, spread before a person to protect him. <!-- Page 156

  <p>464. <i>see of Grece</i>, here put for the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

  <p>470-504. Not in the French text; perhaps added in revision.</p>

  <p>474. <i>Ther</i>, where; as usual. <i>knave</i>, servant.</p>

  <p>475. 'Was eaten by the lion ere he could escape.' Cf. l. 437.</p>

  <p>480. The word <i>clerkes</i> refers to Boethius. This passage is due
  to Boeth. bk. iv. pr. 6. 114-117, and 152-4; see vol. ii. pp. 117,
  118.</p>

  <p>491. See Revelation vii. 1-3.</p>

  <p>497. Here (if <i>that</i> be omitted) <i>As</i> seems to form a foot
  by itself, which gives but a poor line. See note to l. 404.</p>

  <p>500. Alluding to St. Mary the Egyptian (<i>Maria Egiptiaca</i>), who
  according to the legend, after a youth spent in debauchery, lived
  entirely alone for the last forty-seven years of her life in the
  wilderness beyond the Jordan. She lived in the fifth century. Her day is
  April 9. See Mrs. Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art; Rutebuef, ed.
  Jubinal, ii. 106-150; Maundeville's Travels, ed. Halliwell, p. 96; Aurea
  Legenda, ed. Grässe, cap. lvi. She was often confused with St. Mary
  Magdalen.</p>

  <p>508. <i>Northumberlond</i>, the district, not the county. Yorkshire
  is, in fact, meant, as the French version expressly mentions the
  Humber.</p>

  <p>512. <i>the constable</i>; named <i>Elda</i> by Trivet and Gower.</p>

  <p>519. Trivet says that she answered Elda in his own language, 'en
  sessoneys,' in Saxon, for she had learnt many languages in her youth.</p>

  <p>525. The word <i>deye</i> seems to have had two pronunciations; in l.
  644 it is <i>dye</i>, with a different rime. In fact, Mr. Cromie's
  'Ryme-Index' to Chaucer proves the point. On the one hand, <i>deye</i>
  rimes to <i>aweye</i>, <i>disobeye</i>, <i>dreye</i>, <i>preye</i>,
  <i>seye</i>, <i>tweye</i>, <i>weye</i>; and on the other, <i>dye</i>
  rimes to <i>avoutrye</i>, <i>bigamye</i>, <i>compaignye</i>,
  <i>Emelye</i>, <i>genterye</i>, <i>lye</i>, <i>maladye</i>, &amp;c. So
  also, <i>high</i> appears both as <i>hey</i> and <i>hy</i>.</p>

  <p>527. <i>forgat hir minde</i>, lost her memory.</p>

  <p>531. The final <i>e</i> in <i>plese</i> is preserved from elision by
  the cæsural pause. Or, we may read <i>plesen</i>; yet the MSS. have
  <i>plese</i>.</p>

  <p>533. <i>Hermengild</i>; spelt <i>Hermyngild</i> in Trivet; answering
  to A. S. <i>Eormengild</i> (Lappenberg, Hist. England, i. 285). Note that
  St. Hermengild was martyred just at this very time, Apr. 13, 846.</p>

  <p>543. <i>plages</i>, regions; we even find the word in Marlowe's
  Tamburlaine, pt. i. act iv. sc. 4, and pt. ii. act i. sc. 1. The latter
  passage is&mdash;'From Scythia to the oriental <i>plage</i> Of

  Pope) turned, by a pun, into Alleluia, according to the version of the

  Eccl. Hist. b. ii. c. 1. <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>584. <i>quyte her whyle</i>, repay her time; i.&nbsp;e. her pains, trouble;

  intended.</p>

  <p>585. 'The plot of the knight against Constance, and also her
  subsequent adventure with the steward, are both to be found, with some
  variations, in a story in the Gesta Romanorum, ch. 101; MS. Harl. 2270.
  Occleve has versified the whole story'; Tyrwhitt. See vol. iii. p. 410,
  for further information. Compare the conduct of Iachimo, in
  Cymbeline.</p>

  <p>609. See Troil. iv. 357.</p>

  <p>620. <i>Berth hir on hond</i>, affirms falsely; lit. bears her in
  hand. Chaucer uses the phrase 'to bere in hond' with the sense of false
  affirmation, sometimes with the idea of accusing falsely, as here and in
  the Wyf of Bathes Prologue, D. 393; and sometimes with that of persuading
  falsely, D. 232, 380. In Shakespeare the sense is rather&mdash;'to keep
  in expectation, to amuse with false pretences'; Nares's Glossary. Barbour
  uses it in the more general sense of 'to affirm,' or 'to make a
  statement,' whether falsely or truly. In Dyce's Skelton, i. 237, occurs
  the line&mdash;'They bare me in hande that I was a spye'; which Dyce
  explains by 'they accused me, laid to my charge that,' &amp;c. He refers
  us to Palsgrave, who has some curious examples of it. E.g., at p.
  450:&mdash;'<i>I beare in hande</i>, I threp upon a man that he hath done
  a dede or make hym beleve so, <i>Ie fais accroyre</i> ... I beare hym in
  hande he was wode, <i>Ie luy metz sus la raige</i>, or <i>ie luy metz sus
  quil estoyt enragé</i>. What crime or yuell mayest thou beare me in hande
  of'; &amp;c. So also: 'Many be borne an hande of a faute, and punysshed
  therfore, that were neuer gylty; Plerique facinoris <i>insimulantur</i>,'
  &amp;c.; Hormanni Vulgaria, sig. m. ii. ed. 1530. In Skelton's Why Come
  Ye Nat to Courte, l. 449, <i>bereth on hand</i> simply means
  'persuades.'</p>

  <p>631-58. Not in the original. A later insertion, of much beauty.</p>

  <p>634. 'And bound Satan; and he still lies where he (then) lay.' In the
  Apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, Christ descends into hell, and (according
  to some versions) binds him with chains; see Piers Plowman, B. xviii.
  401.</p>

  <p>639. <i>Susanne</i>; see the story of Susannah, in the Apocrypha.</p>

  <p>641. The Virgin's mother is called Anna in the Apocryphal Gospel of
  James. Her day is July 26. See Aurea Legenda, ed. Grässe, cap. cxxxi;
  Cowper's Apocryphal Gospels, p. 4.</p>

  And see note to Sq. Tale, F. 479.</p>

  <p>664. <i>us avyse</i>, deliberate with ourselves, consider the matter
  again. Compare the law-phrase <i>Le roi s'avisera</i>, by which the king
  refuses assent to a measure proposed. 'We will consider whom to appoint
  as judge.'</p>

  <p>669. A very similar miracle is recorded in the old alliterative
  romance of Joseph of Arimathea, l. 362. The French version has:&mdash;'a
  peine auoit fini la parole, qe vne mayn close, com poyn de homme, apparut
  deuant Elda et quant questoient en presence, et ferri tiel coup en le
  haterel le feloun, que ambedeus lez eus lui enuolerent de la teste, &amp;
  les dentz hors de la bouche; &amp; le feloun chai abatu a la terre; et a
  ceo dist vne voiz en le oyance de touz: Aduersus filiam matris ecclesie
  ponebas scandalum; hec fecisti, et tacui.' I.&nbsp;e. 'Scarcely had he ended
  the word, when a closed hand, like a man's fist, appeared before Elda and
  all who were in the presence, and smote such a blow on the nape of the
  felon's neck that both his eyes flew out of his head, and the teeth out
  of his mouth; and the felon fell smitten down to the earth; and thereupon
  a voice said in the hearing of all, "Against the daughter of Mother
  Church thou wast laying a scandal; this hast thou done, and I held my
  peace."' The reading <i>tacui</i> suggests that, in l. 676, the word
  <i>holde</i> should rather be <i>held</i>; but the MSS. do not recognise
  this reading.</p>

  <p>697. <i>hir thoughte</i>, it seemed to her; <i>thoughte</i> is here
  impersonal; so in l. 699. The French text adds that Domulde (Donegild)
  was, moreover, jealous of hearing the praises of Constance's beauty.</p>

  <p>701. <i>Me list nat</i>, it pleases me not, I do not wish to. He does
  not wish to give every detail. In this matter Chaucer is often very
  judicious; Gower and others often give the more unimportant matters as
  fully as the rest. Cf. l. 706; and see Squyeres Tale, F. 401.</p>

  <p>703. <i>What</i>, why. Cf. Squyeres Tale, F. 283, 298.</p>

  <p>716. Trivet says&mdash;'Puis a vn demy aan passe, vint nouele al Roy
  que les gentz de Albanie, qe sountz les Escotz, furent passes lour
  boundes et guerrirent les terres le Roy. Dount par comun counseil, le Roi
  assembla son ost de rebouter ses enemis. Et auant son departir vers
  Escoce, baila la Reine Constaunce sa femme en la garde Elda, le
  Conestable du chastel, et a Lucius, leuesqe de Bangor; si lour chargea
  que quant ele fut deliueres denlaunt, qui lui feisoient hastiuement
  sauoir la nouele'; i.&nbsp;e. 'Then, after half-a-year, news came to the king
  that the people of Albania, who are the Scots, had passed their bounds,
  and warred on the king's lands. Then by common counsel the king gathered
  his host to rebut his foes. And before his departure towards Scotland, he
  committed Queen Constance his wife to the keeping of Elda, the constable
  of the castle, and of Lucius, bishop of Bangor, and charged them that
  when she was delivered, they should hastily let him know the news.'</p>

  <p>722. <i>knave child</i>, male child; as in Clerkes Tale, E. 444.</p>

  <p>723. <i>at the fontstoon</i>, i.&nbsp;e. at his baptism; French
  text&mdash;'al baptisme fu nome Moris.'</p>

  <p>729. <i>to doon his avantage</i>, to suit his convenience. He hoped,
  by going only a little out of his way, to tell Donegild the news also,
  and to receive a reward for doing so. Trivet says that the old <!-- Page
  159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>[159]</span>Queen was
  then at Knaresborough, situated 'between England and Scotland, as in an
  intermediate place.' Its exact site is less than seventeen miles west of
  York. Donegild pretends to be very pleased at the news, and gives the man
  a rich present.</p>

  <p>736. <i>lettres</i>; so in all seven MSS.; Tyrwhitt reads
  <i>lettre</i>. But it is right as it is. <i>Lettres</i> is sometimes
  used, like Lat. <i>literae</i>, in a singular sense, and the French text
  has 'les lettres.' Examples occur in Piers Plowman, B. ix. 38; Bruce, ii.
  80. See l. 744, and note to l. 747.</p>

  <p>738. <i>If ye wol aught</i>, if you wish (to say) anything.</p>

  <p>740. <i>Donegild</i> is dissyllabic here, as in l. 695, but in l. 805
  it appears to have three syllables. Chaucer constantly alters proper
  names so as to suit his metre.</p>

  <p>743. <i>sadly</i>, steadily, with the idea of long continuance.</p>

  <p>747. <i>lettre</i>; here the singular form is used, but it is a matter
  of indifference. Exactly the same variation occurs in Barbour's Bruce,
  ii. 80:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And, among othir, <i>lettres</i> ar gayn</p>
      <p>To the byschop off Androwis towne,</p>
      <p>That tauld how slayn wes that baroun.</p>
      <p>The <i>lettir</i> tauld hym all the deid,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This circumstance, of exchanging the messenger's letters for forged
  ones, is found in Matthew Paris's account of the Life of Offa the first;
  ed. Wats, pp. 965-968.</p>

  <p>748. <i>direct</i>, directed, addressed; French text 'maundez.'</p>

  <p>751. Pronounce <i>horrible</i> as in French.</p>

  <p>752. The last word in this line should rather be <i>nas</i> (= was
  not), as has kindly been pointed out to me; though the seven MSS. and the
  old editions all have <i>was</i>. By this alteration we should secure a
  true rime.</p>

  <p>754. <i>elf</i>; French text&mdash;'ele fu malueise espirit en fourme
  de femme,' she was an evil spirit in form of woman. <i>Elf</i> is the
  A.S. <i>ælf</i>, Icel. <i>álfr</i>, G. <i>alp</i> and <i>elfe</i>;
  Shakespeare writes <i>ouphes</i> for <i>elves</i>. 'The Edda
  distinguishes between Ljósálfar, the elves of light, and Dökkálfar, elves
  of darkness; the latter are not elsewhere mentioned either in modern
  fairy tales or in old writers.... In the Alvismál, elves and dwarfs are
  clearly distinguished as different. The abode of the elves in the Edda is
  Álfheimar, fairy land, and their king the god Frey, the god of light. In
  the fairy tales the Elves haunt the hills; hence their name Huldufólk,
  hidden people; respecting their origin, life, and customs, see Íslenzkar
  þjóðsögur, i. 1. In old writers the Elves are rarely mentioned; but that
  the same tales were told as at present is clear'; note on the word
  <i>álfr</i>, in Cleasby and Vigfusson's Icelandic Dictionary. See also
  Keightley's Fairy Mythology, and Brand's Popular Antiquities. The word is
  here used in a bad sense, and is nearly equivalent to witch. In the
  Prompt. Parv. we find&mdash;'Elfe, spryte, <i>Lamia</i>'; and Mr. Way
  notes that these elves were often supposed to bewitch children, and to
  use them cruelly. <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>[160]</span></p>

  <p>767. Pronounce <i>ágreáble</i> nearly as in French, and with an accent
  on the first and third syllables.</p>

  <p>769. <i>take</i>, handed over, delivered. <i>Take</i> often means to
  give or hand over in Middle English: very seldom to convey or bring.</p>

  <p>771. In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. Cp. and Pt. is written&mdash;'Quid
  turpius ebrioso, cui fetor in ore, tremor in corpore, qui promit stulta,
  prodit occulta, cuius mens alienatur, facies transformatur? Nullum enim
  latet secretum ubi regnat ebrietas.' This is obviously the original of
  the stanza, ll. 771-777; cf. note to B. 99 above. There is nothing
  answering to it in Trivet, but it is to be found in Pope Innocent's
  treatise De Contemptu Mundi, lib. ii. c. 19&mdash;<i>De ebrietate</i>.
  Migne's edition has 'promittit multa' for 'promit stulta.' The last
  clause is quoted from Prov. xxxi. 4 in the Vulgate version; our English
  versions omit it. See B. 2384.</p>

  <p>778. 'O Donegild, I have no language fit to tell,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>782. <i>mannish</i>, man-like, i.&nbsp;e. harsh and cruel, not mild and
  gentle like a woman. But Chaucer is not satisfied with the epithet, and
  says he ought rather to call her 'fiend-like.' Perhaps it is worth while
  to say that in Gower's Conf. Amant., lib. vi., where Pauli (iii. 52) has
  'Most liche to <i>mannes</i> creature,' the older edition by Chalmers has
  the form <i>mannish</i>. Lines 778-84 are not in the original.</p>

  <p>789. 'He stowed away plenty (of wine) under his girdle,' i.&nbsp;e. drank
  his fill.</p>

  <p>794. Pronounce <i>constábl'</i> much as if it were French, with an
  accent on <i>a</i>. In l. 808 the accent is on <i>o</i>. Lastly, in l.
  858, all three syllables are fully sounded.</p>

  <p>798. 'Three days and a quarter of an hour'; i.&nbsp;e. she was to be
  allowed only three days, and after that to start off as soon as possible.
  <i>Tide</i> (like <i>tíð</i> in Icelandic) sometimes means an hour. The
  French text says 'deynz quatre iours,' within four days.</p>

  <p>801. <i>croude</i>, push; see ll. 296, 299 above; and note to l.
  299.</p>

  <p>813-26. Lines 813-819 are not in the French, and ll. 820-826 are not
  at all close to the original. The former stanza, which is due to Boeth.
  bk. i. met. 5. 22-30, was doubtless added in the revision.</p>

  <p>827-33. The French text only has&mdash;'en esperaunce qe dure
  comencement amenera dieu a bon fyn, et qil me purra en la mere sauuer, qi
  en mere et en terre est de toute puissaunce.'</p>

  <p>835. The beautiful stanzas in ll. 834-868 are all Chaucer's own; and
  of the next stanza, ll. 869-875, the French text gives but the merest
  hint.</p>

  <p>842. <i>eggement</i>, incitement. The same word is used in other
  descriptions of the Fall. Thus, in Piers Plowman, B. i. 65, it is said of
  Satan that 'Adam and Eue he <i>egged</i> to ille '; and in Allit. Poems,
  ed. Morris, B. 241, it is said of Adam that 'thurgh the <i>eggyng</i> of
  Eue he ete of an apple.'</p>

  <p>852. <i>refut</i>, refuge; see G. 75, and A. B. C. 14.</p>

  <p>859. <i>As lat</i>, pray, let. See note to Clerkes Prologue, E. 7.
  <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page161"></a>[161]</span></p>

  <p>873. <i>purchace</i>, provide, make provision. So in Troilus, bk. ii.
  1125, the line 'And of som goodly answere you purchace' means&mdash;and
  provide yourself with some kind answer, i.&nbsp;e. be ready with a kind
  reply.</p>

  <p>875-84. Much abridged from the French text.</p>

  <p>885. <i>tormented</i>, tortured. However, the French text says the
  messenger acknowledged his drunkenness freely. Examination by torture was
  so common, that Chaucer seems to have regarded the mention of it as being
  the most simple way of telling the story.</p>

  <p>893. <i>out of drede</i>, without doubt, certainly; cf. l. 869. The
  other equally common expression <i>out of doute</i> comes to much the
  same thing, because <i>doute</i> in Middle-English has in general the
  meaning of <i>fear</i> or <i>dread</i>, not of hesitation. See Group E.
  634, 1155; and Prol. A. 487.</p>

  <p>894. <i>pleinly rede</i>, fully read, read at length. In fact, Chaucer
  judiciously omits the details of the French text, where we read that King
  Ælla rushed into his mother's room with a drawn sword as she lay asleep,
  roused her by crying 'traitress!' in a loud voice, and, after hearing the
  full confession which she made in the extremity of her terror, slew her
  and cut her to pieces as she lay in bed.</p>

  <p>901. <i>fleteth</i>, floats. French text&mdash;'le quinte an de cest
  exil, come ele <i>flotaunt</i> sur le mere,' &amp;c. Cf. <i>fleet</i> in
  l. 463.</p>

  <p>905. The name of the castle is certainly not given in the French text,
  which merely says it was 'vn chastel dun Admiral de paens,' i.&nbsp;e. a
  castle of an admiral of the Pagans.</p>

  <p>912. <i>gauren</i>, gaze, stare. See note to Squ. Tale, F. 190.</p>

  <p>913. <i>shortly</i>, briefly; because the poet considerably abridges
  this part of the narrative. The steward's name was Thelous.</p>

  <p>925. The word <i>Auctor</i>, here written in the margin of E.,
  signifies that this stanza and the two following ones are additions to
  the story by the author. At the same time, ll. 925-931 are really taken
  from Chaucer's own translation of Pope Innocent's treatise De Contemptu
  Mundi; see further in the note to B. 99 above. Accordingly, we also find
  here, in the margin of E., the following Latin note:&mdash;'O extrema
  libidinis turpitudo, que non solum mentem effeminat, set eciam corpus
  eneruat. Semper sequ&#x169;ntur dolor et penitentia post,' &amp;c. This
  corresponds to the above treatise, lib. ii. c. 21, headed 'De luxuria.'
  The last clause is abbreviated; the original has:&mdash;'Semper illam
  procedunt ardor et petulantia; semper comitantur fetor et immunditia;
  sequuntur semper dolor et poenitentia.'</p>

  <p>932-45. These two stanzas are wholly Chaucer's, plainly written as a
  parallel passage to that in ll. 470-504 above.</p>

  <p>934. <i>Golias</i>, Goliath. See I Samuel xvii. 25.</p>

  <p>940. See the story of Holofernes in the Monkes Tale, B. 3741; and the
  note. I select the spelling <i>Olofernus</i> here, because it is that of
  the majority of the MSS., and agrees with the title <i>De Oloferno</i> in
  the Monkes Tale.</p>

  <p>947. In l. 465, Chaucer mentions the 'Strait of Marrok,' i.&nbsp;e.
  Morocco, though there is no mention of it in the French text; so here he
  alludes <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>[162]</span>to it again, but by a different name, viz.
  'the mouth of Jubalter and Septe.' <i>Jubaltar</i> (Gibraltar) is from
  the Arabic <i>jabálu't tárik</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the mountain of Tarik; who was
  the leader of a band of Saracens that made a descent upon Spain in the
  eighth century. <i>Septe</i> is Ceuta, on the opposite coast of
  Africa.</p>

  <p>965. <i>shortly</i>, briefly; because Chaucer here again abridges the
  original, which relates how the Romans burnt the Sultaness, and slew more
  than 11,000 of the Saracens, without a single death or even wound on
  their own side.</p>

  <p>967. <i>senatour.</i> His name was Arsemius of Cappadocia; his wife's
  name was Helen. Accent <i>victorie</i> on the <i>o</i>.</p>

  <p>969. <i>as seith the storie</i>, as the history says. The French text
  relates this circumstance fully.</p>

  <p>971. The French text says that, though Arsemius did not recognise
  Constance, she, on her part, recognised him at once, though she did not
  reveal it.</p>

  <p>981. <i>aunte.</i> Helen, the wife of Arsemius, was daughter of
  Sallustius, brother of the Emperor Tiberius, and Constance's uncle. Thus
  Helen was really Constance's first cousin. Chaucer may have altered it
  purposely; but it looks as if he had glanced at the sentence&mdash;'Cest
  heleyne, la nece Constaunce, taunt tendrement ama sa nece,' &amp;c., and
  had read it as&mdash;'This Helen ... loved her <i>niece</i> so tenderly.'
  In reality, the word <i>nece</i> means 'cousin' here, being applied to
  Helen as well as to Constance.</p>

  <p>982. <i>she</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Helen; for Constance knew Helen.</p>

  <p>991. <i>to receyven</i>, i.&nbsp;e. to submit himself to any penance which
  the Pope might see fit to impose upon him. Journeys to Rome were actually
  made by English kings; Ælfred was sent to Rome as a boy, and his father,
  Æthelwulf, also spent a year there, but (as the Chronicle tells us) he
  went 'mid micelre weorðnesse,' with much pomp.</p>

  <p>994. <i>wikked werkes</i>; especially the murder of his mother, as
  Trivet says. See note to l. 894.</p>

  <p>999. <i>Rood him ageyn</i>, rode towards him, rode to meet him; cf. l.
  391. See Cler. Tale, E. 911, and the note.</p>

  <p>1009. <i>Som men wolde seyn</i>, some relate the story by saying. The
  expression occurs again in l. 1086. On the strength of it, Tyrwhitt
  concluded that Chaucer here refers to Gower, who tells the story of
  Constance in Book ii. of his Confessio Amantis. He observes that Gower's
  version of the story includes both the circumstances which are introduced
  by this expression. But this is not conclusive, since we find that
  Nicholas Trivet also makes mention of the same circumstances. In the
  present instance the French text has&mdash;'A ceo temps de la venuz le
  Roi a Rome, comensca Moris son diseotisme aan. Cist estoit <i>apris
  priuement de sa mere Constance, qe, quant il irreit a la feste ou son
  seignur le senatour</i>,' &amp;c.; i.&nbsp;e. At this time of the king's
  coming to Rome, Maurice began his eighteenth year. <i>He was secretly
  instructed by his mother Constance, that, when he should go to the</i>
  <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page163"></a>[163]</span><i>feast with his lord the senator</i>,
  &amp;c. See also the note to l. 1086 below. Besides, Gower may have
  followed Chaucer.</p>

  <p>1014. <i>metes space</i>, time of eating. This circumstance strikingly
  resembles the story of young Roland, who, whilst still a child, was
  instructed by his mother Bertha to appear before his uncle Charlemagne,
  by way of introducing himself. The story is well told in Uhland's ballad
  entitled 'Klein Roland,' a translation of which is given at pp. 335-340
  of my 'Ballads and Songs of Uhland.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'They had but waited a little while,</p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">When Roland returns more bold;</p>
      <p>With hasty step to the king he comes,</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">As though they were woodlands wild,"' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The result is also similar; Bertha is reconciled to Charlemagne, much
  as Constance is to Ælla.</p>

  <p>1034. <i>aught</i>, in any way, at all; lit. 'a whit.'</p>

  <p>1035. <i>sighte</i>, sighed. So also <i>pighte</i>, 'pitched';
  <i>plighte</i>, 'plucked'; and <i>shrighte</i>, 'shrieked.' It occurs
  again in Troil. iii. 1080, iv. 714, 1217, v. 1633; and in the Romaunt of
  the Rose, l. 1746.</p>

  <p>1036. <i>that he mighte</i>, as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>1038. 'I ought to suppose, in accordance with reasonable opinion.'
  Chaucer tells the story quite in his own way. There is no trace of ll.
  1038-1042 in the French, and scarcely any of ll. 1048-1071, which is all
  in his own excellent strain.</p>

  <p>1056. <i>shet</i>, shut, closed. Compare the description of Griselda
  in the Clerkes Tale, E. 1058-1061.</p>

  <p>1058. Both <i>twyes</i> and <i>owne</i> are dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>1060. <i>all his halwes</i>, all His saints. Hence the term
  All-hallow-mas, i.&nbsp;e. All Saints' day.</p>

  <p>1061. <i>wisly</i>, certainly. <i>as have</i>, I pray that he may
  have; see note to l. 859 above. 'I pray He may so surely have mercy on my
  soul, as that I am as innocent of your suffering as Maurice my son is
  like you in the face.'</p>

  <p>1078. After this line, the French text tells us that King Ælla
  presented himself before Pope Pelagius, who absolved him for the death of
  his mother. Pelagius II. was pope in 578-90.</p>

  <p>1086. Here again, Tyrwhitt supposes Chaucer to follow Gower. But, in
  fact, Chaucer and Gower both consulted Trivet, who says <!-- Page 164
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>[164]</span>here&mdash;'Constaunce charga son fitz
  Morice del messager [<i>or</i> message].... Et puis, quant Morice estoit
  deuaunt lempereur venuz, oue la compaignie honurable, et auoit son
  message fest de part le Roi son pere,' &amp;c.; i.&nbsp;e. 'Constance charged
  her son Maurice with the message ... and then, when Maurice was come
  before the emperor, with the honourable company, and had done his message
  on behalf of the king his father,' &amp;c. Or, as before, Gower may have
  copied Chaucer.</p>

  <p>1090. <i>As he</i>; used much as we should now use 'as one.' It refers
  to the Emperor, of course.</p>

  <p>1091. <i>Sente</i>, elliptical for 'as that he would send.' Tyrwhitt
  reads <i>send</i>; but it is best to leave an expression like this as it
  stands in the MSS. It was probably a colloquial idiom; and, in the next
  line, we have <i>wente</i>. Observe that <i>sente</i> is in the
  subjunctive mood, and is equivalent to 'he would send.'</p>

  <p>1107. Chaucer so frequently varies the length and accent of a proper
  name that there is no objection to the supposition that we are here to
  read <i>Cústancë</i> in three syllables, with an accent on the first
  syllable. In exactly the same way, we find <i>Grísildis</i> in three
  syllables (E. 948), though in most other passages it is <i>Grisíld</i>.
  We have had <i>Cústance</i>, accented on the first syllable, several
  times; see ll. 438, 556, 566, 576, &amp;c.; also <i>Custáncë</i>, three
  syllables, ll. 184, 274, 319, 612, &amp;c. Tyrwhitt inserts a second
  <i>your</i> before <i>Custance</i>, but without authority.</p>

  <p>1109. <i>It am I</i>; it is I. It is the usual idiom. So in the A.S.
  version of St. John vi. 20, we find 'ic hyt eom,' i.&nbsp;e. I it am, and in a
  Dutch New Testament, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1700, I find 'Ick ben
  't,' i.&nbsp;e. I am it. The M&oelig;so-Gothic version omits <i>it</i>, having
  simply 'Ik im'; so does Wyclif's, which has 'I am.' Tyndale, <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1526, has 'it ys I.'</p>

  <p>1113. <i>thonketh</i>, pronounced <i>thonk'th</i>; so also
  <i>eyl'th</i>, B. 1171, <i>Abyd'th</i>, B. 1175. So also <i>tak'th</i>,
  l. 1142 below. <i>of</i>, for. So in Chaucer's Balade of Truth, l. 19, we
  have 'thank God <i>of al</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. for all things. See my notes to
  Chaucer's Minor Poems, vol. i. p. 552.</p>

  <p>1123. The French text tells us that he was named Maurice of
  Cappadocia, and was also known, in Latin, as <i>Mauritius
  Christianissimus Imperator</i>. Trivet tells us no more about him, except
  that he accounts for the title 'of Cappadocia' by saying that Arsemius
  (the senator who found Constance and Maurice and took care of them) was a
  Cappadocian. Gibbon says&mdash;'The Emperor Maurice derived his origin
  from ancient Rome; but his immediate parents were settled at Arabissus in
  Cappadocia, and their singular felicity preserved them alive to behold
  and partake the fortune of their august son.... Maurice ascended the
  throne at the mature age of 43 years; and he reigned above 20 years over
  the east and over himself.'&mdash;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,
  cap. xlv. He was murdered, with all his seven children, by his successor,
  Phocas the Usurper; Nov. 27, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 600. His
  accession was in <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 582.</p>

  <p>1127. The statement 'I bere it not in minde,' i.&nbsp;e. I do not remember
  it, may be taken to mean that Chaucer could find nothing about <!-- Page
  165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>[165]</span>Maurice in
  his French text beyond the epithet <i>Christianissimus</i>, which he has
  skilfully expanded into l. 1123. He vaguely refers us to 'olde Romayn
  gestes,' that is, to lives of the Roman emperors, for he can hardly mean
  the Gesta Romanorum in this instance. Gibbon refers us to Evagrius, lib.
  v. and lib. vi.; Theophylact Simocatta; Theophanes, Zonaras, and
  Cedrenus.</p>

  <p>1132. In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. Cp. Pt. is written&mdash;'A mane
  usque ad vesperam mutabitur tempus. Tenent tympanum et gaudent ad sonum
  organi,' &amp;c. See the next note.</p>

  <p>1135. In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. Cp. Pt. is written&mdash;'Quis
  vnquam vnicam diem totam duxit in sua dilectione [<i>vel</i>
  delectatione] iocundam? quem in aliqua parte diei reatus consciencie, vel
  impetus Ire, vel motus concupiscencie non turbauerit? quem liuor Inuidie,
  vel Ardor Auaricie, vel tumor superbie non vexauerit? quem aliqua iactura
  vel offensa, vel passio non commouerit,' &amp;c. Cp. Pt. insert
  <i>inde</i> before <i>non turbauerit</i>. This corresponds to nothing in
  the French text, but it is quoted from Pope Innocent's treatise, De
  Contemptu Mundi, lib. i. c. 22; see note to B. 99 above. The extract in
  the note to l. 1132 occurs in the same chapter, but both clauses in it
  are borrowed; the former from Ecclus. xviii. 26, the latter from Job,
  xxi. 12.</p>

  <p>1143. <i>I gesse</i>, I suppose. Chaucer somewhat alters the story.
  Trivet says that Ælla died at the end of nine months after this.
  Half-a-year after, Constance repairs to Rome. Thirteen days after her
  arrival, her father Tiberius dies. A year later, Constance herself dies,
  on St. Clement's day (Nov. 23), <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 584, and is
  buried at Rome, near her father, in St. Peter's Church. The date 584,
  here given by Trivet, should rather be 583; the death of Tiberius took
  place on Aug. 14, 582; see Gibbon.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Shipman's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>1165. The host here refers to the Man of Lawes Tale, which had just
  been told, and uses the expression '<i>thrifty</i> tale' with reference
  to the same expression above, B. 46. Most MSS. separate this end-link
  widely from the Tale, but MS. Hl. and MS. Arch. Seld. B. 14 have it in
  the right place. See vol. iii. pp. 417-9.</p>

  <p><i>for the nones</i>, for the nonce, for the occasion; see note to the
  Prologue, A. 379. The A.S. <i>&#x101;nes</i> (= once) is an adverb with a
  genitive case-ending; and, being an adverb, becomes indeclinable, and can
  accordingly be used as a <i>dative</i> case after the preposition
  <i>for</i>, which properly governs the dative.</p>

  <p>1166. The Host here turns to the Parson (see Prol. A. 477), and
  adjures him to tell a tale, according to the agreement.</p>

  <p>1167. <i>yore</i>, put for <i>of yore</i>, formerly,
  already.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>1169. <i>Can moche good</i>, know (or are acquainted with) much good;
  i.&nbsp;e. with many good things, Cf. B. 47. <!-- Page 166 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>[166]</span></p>

  <p>1170. <i>Benedicite</i>, bless ye; i.&nbsp;e. bless ye the Lord; the first
  word of the Song of the Three Children, and a more suitable exclamation
  than most of those in common use at the time. In the Knightes Tale, A.
  1785, where Theseus is <i>pondering</i> over the strange event he had
  just witnessed, the word is pronounced <i>in full</i>, as five syllables.
  But in A. 2115, it is pronounced, as here, as a mere trisyllable. The
  syllables to be dropped are the second and third, so that we must say
  <i>ben'cite</i>. This is verified by a passage in the Townley Mysteries,
  p. 85, where it is actually spelt <i>benste</i>, and reduced to two
  syllables only. Cf. notes to B. 1974, and Troil. i. 780.</p>

  <p>1171. <i>man</i>; dat. case after <i>eyleth</i>. Swearing is alluded
  to as a prevalent vice amongst Englishmen in Robert of Brunne, in the
  Persones Tale of Chaucer, and elsewhere.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>1172. <i>O Iankin</i>, &amp;c.; 'O Johnny, you are there, are you?'
  That is, 'so it is you whom I hear, is it, Mr. Johnny?' A derisive
  interruption. It was common to call a priest <i>Sir John</i>, by way of
  mild derision; see Monkes Prol. (B. 3119) and Nonne Prestes Prol. (B.
  4000). The Host carries the derision a little further by using the
  diminutive form. See note to B. 4000.</p>

  <p>1173. <i>a loller</i>, a term of reproach, equivalent to a canting
  fellow. Tyrwhitt aptly cites a passage from a treatise of the period,
  referring to the Harleian Catalogue, no. 1666:&mdash;'Now in Engelond it
  is a comun protectioun ayens persecutioun, if a man is customable to
  swere nedeles and fals and unavised, by the bones, nailes, and sides, and
  other membres of Christ. And to absteyne fro othes nedeles and unleful,
  and repreve sinne by way of charite, is mater and cause now, why Prelates
  and sum Lordes sclaundren men, and clepen hem <i>Lollardes</i>,
  Eretikes,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The reader will not clearly understand this word till he distinguishes
  between the Latin <i>lollardus</i> and the English <i>loller</i>, two
  words of different origin which were <i>purposely</i> confounded in the
  time of Wyclif. The Latin <i>Lollardus</i> had been in use before Wyclif.
  Ducange quotes from Johannes Hocsemius, who says, under the date
  1309&mdash;<span class="nw">-'Eodem</span> anno quidam hypocritae
  gyrovagi, qui <i>Lollardi</i>, sive Deum laudantes, vocabantur, per
  Hannoniam et Brabantiam quasdam mulieres nobiles deceperunt.' He adds
  that Trithemius says in his Chronicle, under the year 1315&mdash;'ita
  appellatos a Gualtero <i>Lolhard</i>, Germano quodam.' Kilian, in his
  Dictionary of Mid. Dutch, says&mdash;'<i>Lollaerd</i>, mussitator,
  mussitabundus'; i.&nbsp;e. a mumbler of prayers. This gives two etymologies
  for <i>Lollardus</i>. Being thus already in use as a term of reproach, it
  was applied to the followers of Wyclif, as we learn from Thomas
  Walsingham, who says, under the year 1377&mdash;'Hi uocabantur a uulgo
  <i>Lollardi</i>, incedentes nudis pedibus'; and
  again&mdash;'<i>Lollardi</i> sequaces Joannis Wiclif.' But the Old
  English <i>loller</i> (from the verb to <i>loll</i>) meant simply a
  lounger, an idle vagabond, as is abundantly clear from a notable passage
  in Piers the Plowman, C-text (ed. Skeat), x. 188-218; where William tells
  us plainly&mdash; <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page167"></a>[167]</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Now kyndeliche, by crist · beþ suche callyd <i>lolleres</i>,</p>
      <p>As by englisch of oure eldres · of olde menne techynge.</p>
      <p>He that <i>lolleþ</i> is lame · oþer his leg out of ioynte,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here were already two (if not three) words confused, but this was not
  all. By a bad pun, the Latin <i>lolium</i>, tares, was connected with
  <i>Lollard</i>, so that we find in Political Poems, i. 232, the
  following&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Lollardi sunt zizania,</p>

      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">Quae uastant hortum uineae.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This obviously led to allusions to the Parable of the Tares, and fully
  accounts for the punning allusion to <i>cockle</i>, i.&nbsp;e. tares, in l.
  1183. Mr. Jephson observes that <i>lolium</i> is used in the Vulgate
  Version, Matt. xii. 25; but this is a mistake, as the word there used is
  <i>zizania</i>. Gower, Prol. to Conf. Amant., ed. Pauli, i. 15, speaks
  of&mdash;</p>

  i. 331, note.</p>

  <p>1180. 'He shall not give us any commentary on a gospel.' To
  <i>glose</i> is to comment upon, with occasional free introduction of
  irrelevant matter. The <i>gospel</i> is the text, or portion of the
  Gospel commented upon.</p>

  <p>1181. 'We all agree in the one fundamental article of faith'; by which
  he insinuates&mdash;'and let that suffice; we want no theological
  subtilties discussed here.'</p>

  <p>1183. <i>springen</i>, scatter, <i>sprink</i><span
  class="nw">-le.</span> The pt. t. is <i>spreynde</i> or <i>spreynte</i>;
  the pp. <i>spreynd</i> occurs in B. 422, 1830.&mdash;M. Gower, Conf.
  Amantis, bk. v., ed. Pauli, ii. 190, speaks of <i>lollardie</i></p>

  <p>1185. <i>body</i>, i.&nbsp;e. self. Cf. <i>lyf</i> = a person, in P.
  Plowman, B. iii. 292.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>1186. See B. 3984, which suggests that there is a play upon words
  here. The Shipman will make his horse's bells ring loudly enough to awake
  them all; or he will ring so merry a peal, as to rouse them like a church
  bell that awakes a sleeper.</p>

  <p>1189. It is plain that the unmeaning words <i>phislyas</i> and
  <i>phillyas</i>, as in the MSS., must be corruptions of some difficult
  form. I think that form is certainly <i>physices</i>, with reference to
  the Physics of Aristotle, here conjoined with 'philosophy' and 'law' in
  order to include the chief forms of medieval learning. Aristotle was only
  known, in Chaucer's time, in Latin translations, and <i>Physices
  Liber</i> would be a possible title for such a translation. Lewis and
  Short's Lat. Dict. gives '<i>physica</i>, gen. <!-- Page 168 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>[168]</span><i>physicae</i>, and
  <i>physice</i>, gen. <i>physices</i>, f., = <span title="phusikê" class="grk"
  >&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F75;</span>, natural science,
  natural philosophy, physics, Cicero, Academ. 1. 7. 25; id. De Finibus, 3.
  21. 72; 3. 22. 73.' Magister Artium et <i>Physices</i> was the name of a
  degree; see Longfellow's Golden Legend, § vi.</p>

  <p>That Chaucer should use the gen. <i>physices</i> alone, is just in his
  usual manner; cf. <i>Iudicum</i>, B. 3236; <i>Eneidos</i>, B. 4549;
  <i>Metamorphoseos</i>, B. 93. Tyrwhitt's reading <i>of physike</i> gives
  the same sense.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Shipmannes Tale.</b></p>

  <p>This Tale agrees rather closely with one in Boccaccio's
  <i>Decamerone</i>, Day viii. nov. 1. See further in vol. iii. p. 420.</p>

  <p>1191. <i>Seint Denys</i>, Saint Denis, in the environs of Paris. Cf.
  ll. 1247, 1249, and note to 1341.</p>

  <p>1202. <i>us</i>, i.&nbsp;e. us women. This is clear proof that some of the
  opening lines of this Tale were not originally intended for the Shipman,
  but for the Wife of Bath, as she is the only lady in the company to whom
  they would be suitable. We may remember that Chaucer originally meant to
  make each pilgrim tell <i>four</i> Tales; so there is nothing surprising
  in the fact that he once thought of giving this to the Wife. This passage
  is parallel to D. 337-339.</p>

  <p>1209. <i>perilous.</i> Cf. D. 339: 'it is peril of our chastitee.'</p>

  <p>1228. Referring to the common proverb&mdash;'As fain as a fowl [bird]
  of a fair day'; cf. l. 1241 below, A. 2437, G. 1342.</p>

  <p>1233. <i>Daun</i>, Dan, for Lat. <i>Dominus</i>, corresponding to E.
  <i>sir</i>, as in 'Sir John,' a common title for a priest. Cf. B.
  3119.</p>

  <p>1244. <i>Shoop him</i>, lit. shaped himself, set about, got ready. Cf.
  P. Plowman, C. i. 2, xiv. 247, and the notes.</p>

  <p>1245. <i>Brugges</i>, Bruges; which, as Wright remarks, was 'the grand
  central mart of European commerce in the middle ages.' Cf. P. Plowman, C.
  vii. 278, and the note.</p>

  <p>1256. <i>graunges</i>, granges; cf. notes to A. 3668, and A. 166.</p>

  <p>1260. <i>Malvesye</i>, Malmsey; so named from <i>Malvasia</i>, now
  <i>Napoli di Malvasia</i>, a town on the E. coast of Lacedaemonia in the
  Morea. See note in the Babees Book, ed. Furnivall, p. 206, where
  <i>Malvasia</i> is explained as the Ital. corruption of
  <i>Monemvasia</i>, from Gk. <span title="monê embasia" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F79;&nu;&eta;
  &#x1F10;&mu;&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span>, single entrance;
  with reference to its position.</p>

  <p>1261. <i>Vernage.</i> In the Babees Book, ed. Furnivall, p. 203,
  <i>vernage</i> is said to be a red wine, bright, sweet, and somewhat
  rough, from Tuscany and Genoa, and other parts of Italy. The Ital. name
  is <i>vernaccia</i>, lit. the name of a thick-skinned grape. The
  information in this note and the preceding one is drawn from Henderson's
  History of Ancient and Modern Wines, 1824: which see.</p>

  <p>1262. <i>volatyl</i>, wild fowl, game; here used as a collective
  plural, to represent Lat. <i>uolatilia</i>. Littré quotes: 'Tant ot les
  <i>volatiles</i> chieres'; Roman de la Rose, 20365. Wyclif has <i>al
  volatile</i> to translate <i>cunctum</i> <!-- Page 169 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>[169]</span><i>uolatile</i>, Gen.
  vii. 14; also <i>my volatilis</i> in Matt. xxii. 4, where the Vulgate has
  <i>altilia</i>. Cf. F. <i>volaille</i>.</p>

  <p>1278. <i>passed pryme</i>, past 9 <span class="sm">A.M.</span> See
  notes to A. 3906, F. 73; and cf. B. 1396.</p>

  <p>1281. <i>his thinges</i>, the things he had to say; cf. F. 78. It
  'means the divine office in the Breviary, i.&nbsp;e. the psalms and lessons
  from scripture which, being absent from the convent, he was bound to say
  privately'; Bell. <i>curteisly</i>, reverently. See note to l. 1321
  below.</p>

  <p>1287. <i>under the yerde</i>, still subject to the discipline of the
  rod. As girls were married at a very early age, this should mean 'still
  quite a child.' Cf. <i>as hir list</i> in l. 1286. And see E. 22. See
  Ælfric's Colloquy (Wright's Vocab. ed. Wülker, p. 102), where the boy
  says he is still <i>sub uirga</i>, on which the A.S. gloss is <i>under
  gyrda</i>. F. <i>sous la verge</i> (Littré).</p>

  <p>1292. <i>appalled</i>, enfeebled, languid; see F. 365.</p>

  <p>1293. <i>dare</i>, lie motionless. This is the original sense of the
  word, as in E. Friesic <i>bedaren</i>. So also Low G. <i>bedaren</i>, to
  be still and quiet; as in <i>dat weer bedaart</i>, the weather becomes
  settled; <i>een bedaart mann</i>, a man who has lost the fire of youth.
  Du. <i>bedaren</i>, to compose, to calm. The rather common M.E. phrase
  <i>to droupe and dare</i> means 'to sink down and lie quiet,' like a
  hunted animal in hiding; hence came the secondary sense 'to lurk' or 'lie
  close,' as in the Prompt. Parv. Cotgrave has F. <i>blotir</i>, 'to squat,
  skowke, or lie close to the ground, like a <i>daring</i> lark or
  affrighted foul.' Hence also a third sense, 'to peer round,' as a lurking
  creature that looks out for possible danger. The word is common in M.E.,
  and in many passages the sense 'to lie still' suits better than 'lurk,'
  as it is usually explained.</p>

  <p>1295. <i>Were</i>, 'which might be,' 'which should happen to be'; the
  relative is understood. <i>forstraught</i>, distracted. Such is evidently
  the sense; but the word occurs nowhere else, and is incorrect. As far as
  I can make it out, Chaucer has coined this word incorrectly. The right
  word is <i>destrat</i> (vol. ii. p. 67, l. 1), from O.F. <i>destrait</i>,
  pp. of <i>destraire</i>, to tear asunder (as by horses), to torment,
  fatigue (Godefroy). Next, he turned it (1) into <i>forstrait</i>, pp. of
  <i>forstraire</i> (<i>fortraire</i> in Cotgrave), to purloin; and (2)
  into <i>forstraught</i>, as if it were the pp. of an A.S.
  *<i>for-streccan</i>, to stretch exceedingly. Thus, he has made one
  change by altering the prefix, and another by misdividing the word and
  substituting English for French. A similar mistake is seen in the absurd
  form <i>distraught</i>, used for 'distracted,' though it is, formally,
  equivalent to <i>dis-straught</i>, as if made up of the prefix
  <i>dis</i><span class="nw">-</span> and the pp. of <i>strecchen</i>, to
  stretch. An early instance occurs in Lydgate's Minor Poems, ed.
  Halliwell, p. 206, where we find '<i>Distrauhte</i> in thouhte,' i.&nbsp;e.
  distracted in thought, mad. There is much confusion between the E.
  prefixes <i>for-</i>, <i>fore-</i>, and the F. <i>fors-</i>, <i>for-</i>.
  Chaucer has <i>straughte</i> (correctly), as the pt. t. of
  <i>strecchen</i>, in A. 2916.</p>

  <p>1298. Accent <i>labóured</i> on the second syllable. <!-- Page 170
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>[170]</span></p>

  <p>1303. 'God knows all'; implying, 'I can contradict you, if I choose to
  speak.'</p>

  <p>1321. <i>port-hors</i>, for <i>porte-hors</i>, lit. 'carry-abroad,'
  the F. equivalent of Lat. <i>portiforium</i>, a breviary. Also spelt
  <i>portous</i>, <i>portess</i>, &amp;c. 'The <i>Portous</i>, or Breviary,
  contained whatever was to be said by all beneficed clerks, and those in
  holy orders, either in choir, or privately by themselves, as they recited
  their daily canonical hours; no musical notation was put into these
  books.'&mdash;Rock, Church of our Fathers, v. iii. pt. 2, p. 212. Dan
  John had just been saying 'his things' out of it (l. 1281). The music was
  omitted to save space. See P. Plowman, B. xv. 122, and my note on the
  line.</p>

  <p>1327. <i>for to goon</i>, i.&nbsp;e. even though going to hell were the
  penalty of my keeping secret what you tell me.</p>

  <p>1329. 'This I do, not for kinship, but out of true love.'</p>

  <p>1335. <i>a legende</i>, a story of martyrdom, like that of a saint's
  life.</p>

  <p>1338. St. Martin of Tours, whose day is Nov. 11.</p>

  <p>1341. St. Denis of France, St. Dionysius, bishop of Paris, martyred
  <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 272, whose day is Oct. 9. Near his place of
  martyrdom was built a chapel, which was first succeeded by a church, and
  then by the famous abbey of St. Denis, in which King Dagobert and his
  successors were interred. The French adopted St. Denis as their patron
  saint; see Chambers, Book of Days, ii. 427; Alban Butler, Lives of the
  Saints, Oct. 9.</p>

  <p>1353. <i>sit</i>, is becoming, befits; see E. 460, 1277.</p>

  <p>1384. <i>Geniloun</i>, Genilon or Ganelon, the traitor who betrayed
  Charlemagne's army at Roncesvalles. For this deed he was torn to death by
  wild horses, according to the romance-writers. See La Chanson de Roland,
  l. 3735. Cf. note to B. 3579, and Book of the Duchesse, 1121, and my note
  upon it.</p>

  <p>1396. <i>chilindre</i>, a kind of portable sun-dial, lit. cylinder. A
  thirteenth-century Latin treatise on the use of the <i>chilindre</i> was
  edited by Mr. E. Brock for the Chaucer Society, and I here copy his clear
  description of the instrument. 'The Chilindre (<i>cylindrus</i>) or
  cylinder is one of the manifold forms of the sun-dial, very simple in its
  construction, but rude and inaccurate as a time-shower. According to the
  following treatise, it consists of a wooden cylinder, with a central bore
  from top to bottom, and with a hollow space in the top, into which a
  moveable rotary lid with a little knob at the top is fitted. This lid is
  also bored in the centre, and a string passed through the whole
  instrument. Upon this string the chilindre hangs [perpendicularly] when
  in use. The style or gnomon works on a pin fixed in the lid. When the
  instrument is in use, the style projects at a right angle to the surface
  of the cylindrical body, through a notch in the side of the lid, but can,
  at pleasure, be turned down and slipt into the central bore, which is
  made a little wider at the top to receive it. The body of the
  <i>chilindre</i> is marked with a table of the points of the shadow, a
  table of degrees for finding the sun's altitude, and spaces corresponding
  to <!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page171"></a>[171]</span>the months of the year and the signs of
  the zodiac. Across these spaces are drawn six oblique hour-lines.</p>

  <p>'To ascertain the time of day by the <i>chilindre</i>, consider what
  month it is, and turn the lid round till the style stands directly over
  the corresponding part of the <i>chilindre</i>; then hold up the
  instrument by the string so that the style points towards the sun, or in
  other words, so that the shadow of the style falls perpendicularly, and
  the hour will be shewn by the lowest line reached by the shadow.'</p>

  <p>Another treatise of the same character was subsequently edited by Mr.
  Brock for the same Society. It is entitled 'Practica Chilindri; or the
  Working of the Cylinder; by John Hoveden.'</p>

  <p>There is a curious reference to the same instrument in the following
  passage from Horman's Vulgaria, leaf 338, back:&mdash;'There be
  iorneyringis [day-circles, dials] and instrume<i>n</i>t<i>is</i> lyke an
  ha<i>n</i>gynge pyler with a tu<i>n</i>ge lyllyng [lolling] out, to knowe
  what tyme of the day.'</p>

  <p>In Wright's Vocabularies, ed. Wülker, 572. 22, we find:
  '<i>Chilindrus, anglice</i> a leuel; <i>uel est instrumentum quo hore
  notantur, anglice</i> a chylaundre.' It thus appears that the reading
  <i>kalendar</i>, in the old editions, is due to a mistake.</p>

  <p>The most interesting comment on this passage is afforded by the
  opening lines of the Prologue to Part II. of Lydgate's <i>Siege of
  Thebes</i>, where Lydgate is clearly thinking of Chaucer's words. Here
  also the black-letter edition of 1561 has <i>Kalendar</i>, but the
  reading of MS. Arundel 119 (leaf 18) is more correct, as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>pryme of day</i>, 9 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>, in the present
  passage; see above, and note the preparations for dinner in ll.
  1399-1401; the dinner-hour being 10 <span class="sm">A.M.</span> See also
  note to A. 3906. 'Our forefathers dined at an hour at which we think it
  fashionable to breakfast; <i>ten o 'clock</i> was the time established by
  ancient usage for the principal meal'; Our Eng. Home, p. 33. In earlier
  times it was <i>nine</i> o'clock; see Wright, Hist. of Domestic Manners,
  p. 155.</p>

  <p>1399. 'As cheery as a magpie.'</p>

  <p>1404. <i>Qui la?</i> who's there. All the MSS. agree in thus cutting
  down the expression <i>qui est la</i> to two words; and this abbreviation
  is emphasised by the English gloss 'Who ther' in E. and Hn.; Cm. has
  <i>Who there</i>, without any French. It is clear, too, that the line is
  imperfect at the caesura, thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Qui la</i>? | quod he. | &mdash;Pe | ter it | am I ||</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This medial pause is probably intentional, to mark the difference
  between the speakers. Ed. 1532 (which Tyrwhitt follows) has <i>Qui est
  la</i>, in order to fill out the line. Wright has the same; and (as
  usual) suppresses the fact that the word <i>est</i> is not in the MS.
  which he follows 'with literal accuracy.' <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>[172]</span></p>

  <p><i>Peter!</i> by Saint Peter! a too common exclamation, shewing that
  even women used to swear. It occurs again in D. 446, 1332, and Hous of
  Fame, 1034, 2000.</p>

  <p>1412. <i>elenge</i>, pronounced (eeléngg&#x259;), in a dreary,
  tedious, lonely manner; drearily. From A.&nbsp;S. <i>&#x1E3;lenge</i>,
  lengthy, protracted; a derivative from <i>lang</i>, long; see P. Plowman,
  C. i. 204, and the note. In Pegge's Kenticisms (E. D. S. Gloss. C. 3), we
  have: '<i>Ellinge</i> [<i>pronounced</i> éllinj], <i>adj.</i> solitary,
  lonely, melancholy, farre from neighbours. See Ray.' It is also still in
  use in Sussex. The usual derivation from A.&nbsp;S. <i>ellende</i>, foreign,
  is incorrect; but it seems to have been confused with this word, whence
  the sense of 'strange, foreign,' was imported into it. See <i>Alange</i>
  in the New E. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>1413. <i>go we dyne</i>, let us go and dine; as in P. Plowman, C. i.
  227.</p>

  <p>1417. <i>Seint Yve.</i> 'St. Ivia, or Ivo,' says Alban Butler, 'was a
  Persian bishop, who preached in England in the seventh century.' He died
  at St. Ive's in Huntingdonshire. A church was also built in his honour at
  St. Ive's in Cornwall. His day is April 25. This line is repeated in D.
  1943. Cf. A. 4264.</p>

  <p>1421. <i>dryve forth</i>, spend our time in; cf. P. Plowman, C. i.
  225.</p>

  <p>1423. <i>pleye</i>, 'take some relaxation by going on a pilgrimage';
  clearly shewing the chief object of pilgrimages. Cf. D. 557. The line
  also indicates that it was a practice, when men could no longer make a
  show in the world, to go on a pilgrimage, or 'go out of the way'
  somewhere, to avoid creditors.</p>

  <p>1436. <i>houshold.</i> So in E. Hn. Cm.; Cp. Pt. Ln. Hl. T. have
  <i>housbonde</i>, <i>housbond</i>, but the application of this word to a
  housewife is not happy.</p>

  <p>1441. <i>messe</i>, mass; it seems to have been said, on this
  occasion, about 9.30 <span class="sm">A.M.</span> It did not take long;
  cf. l. 1413.</p>

  <p>1445. <i>At-after</i>, soon after. This curious form is still in use;
  see the Cleveland Glossary. So in the Whitby Glossary:&mdash;'All things
  in order; ploughing first, sowing <i>at-after</i>.' Cf. <i>'at-after</i>
  supper,' Rich. III. iv. 3. 31; and see <i>At</i>, § 40, in the New E.
  Dict. We find also <i>at-under</i> and <i>at-before</i>. It occurs again
  in F. 1219.</p>

  <p>1466. <i>a myle-wey</i>, even by twenty minutes (the time taken to
  walk a mile).</p>

  <p>1470. <i>Graunt mercy of</i>, many thanks for.</p>

  <p>1476. 'God defend (forbid) that ye should spare.'</p>

  <p>1484. <i>took</i>, handed over, delivered; see note to P. Plowman, C.
  iv. 47. And see l. 1594 below.</p>

  <p>1496. <i>let</i>, leadeth, leads; note the various readings. Cf. 'Thet
  is the peth of pouerte huerby <i>let</i> the holy gost tho thet,'
  &amp;c.; i.&nbsp;e. that is the path of poverty whereby the Holy Ghost leads
  those that, &amp;c.&mdash;Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 185; and so again in the
  same, p. 115, l. 9, and p. 51, l. 13. In P. Plowman, B. iii. 157, the
  Rawlinson MS. has <i>let</i> instead of <i>ledeth</i>. <!-- Page 173
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>[173]</span></p>

  <p>1499. <i>crowne</i>; alluding to the priestly tonsure. See note to P.
  Plowman, C. i. 86.</p>

  <p>1506. For <i>bolt-upright</i>, see note to A. 4194. This line is
  defective in the first foot; read&mdash;Hav' | hir in | his, &amp;c.
  Tyrwhitt reads <i>Haven</i>, but admits, in the notes, that the final
  <i>n</i> came out of his own head.</p>

  <p>1515. <i>the faire</i>, the fair at Bruges. On fairs, see the note to
  P. Plowman, C. vii. 211.</p>

  <p>1519. <i>chevisaunce</i>, a contract for borrowing money on his
  credit; see A. 282, and note to P. Plowman, B. v. 249. For the purpose of
  making such a contract, a proportional sum had to be paid down in ready
  money; see note to l. 1524.</p>

  <p>1524. 'A certain (number of) franks; and some (franks) he took with
  him.' The latter sum refers to the money he had to pay down in order to
  get the <i>chevisance</i> made. See note to Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew,
  p. 528. And see l. 1558.</p>

  <p>1542. Here <i>sheeld</i> is used as a plural, by analogy with
  <i>pund</i>, i.&nbsp;e. pounds. A <i>sheeld</i> was a French <i>écu</i>, or
  crown; see A. 278.</p>

  <p>1557. <i>Lumbardes</i>, Lombards, the great money-lenders and bankers
  of the middle ages. Cf. 'Lumbardes of Lukes, that lyuen by lone as
  Iewes,' Lombards from Lucca, that live by lending, as Jews do; P.
  Plowman, C. v. 194. Owing to the accent, <i>Lumbard's</i> is
  dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>1558. <i>bond</i> is misprinted <i>hond</i> in Wright's edition; MS.
  Hl. has <i>bond</i>, correctly, though the note in Bell says
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>1592. <i>Marie</i>, by St. Mary; the familiar 'Marry!' as used by our
  dramatists.</p>

  <p>1595. <i>yvel thedom</i>, ill success. Cf. 'Now, sere, evyl thedom com
  to thi snoute'; Coventry Mysteries, p. 139. This is printed by Halliwell
  in the form&mdash;'Now, sere evyl Thedom, com to thi snoute,' i.&nbsp;e. 'now,
  sir Ill Success, come to thy snout'; but <i>how</i> a man can come to his
  own nose, we are not told.</p>

  <p>1599. <i>bele chere</i>, fair entertainment, hospitality. <i>Bele</i>
  = mod. F. <i>belle</i>.</p>

  <p>1606. 'Score it upon my tally,' make a note of it. See A. 570, and
  note to P. Plowman, C. v. 61.</p>

  <p>1613. <i>to wedde</i>, as a pledge (common). Cf. A. 1218.</p>

  <p>1621. <i>large</i>, liberal; hence E. <i>largesse</i>, liberality.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Prioress's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>1625. <i>corpus dominus</i>; of course for <i>corpus domini</i>, the
  Lord's body. But it is unnecessary to correct the Host's Latin.</p>

  <p>1626. 'Now long mayest thou sail along the coast!'</p>

  <p>1627. <i>marineer</i>, Fr. <i>marinier</i>; we now use the ending
  <i><span class="nw">-er</span></i>; but modern words of French origin
  shew their lateness by the accent on the last syllable, as
  <i>engineer</i>.&mdash;M. The Fr. <i>pionnier</i> is <i>pioner</i> in
  Shakespeare, but is now <i>pioneer</i>.</p>

  <p>1628. 'God give this monk a thousand cart-loads of bad years!' <!--
  Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>[174]</span>He
  alludes to the deceitful monk described in the Shipman's Tale. A
  <i>last</i> is a very heavy load. In a Statute of 31 Edw. I. a
  <i>weight</i> is declared to be 14 stone; 2 <i>weights</i> of wool are to
  make a <i>sack</i>; and 12 <i>sacks</i> a <i>last</i>. This makes a last
  of wool to be 336 stone, or 42 cwt. But the dictionaries shew that the
  weight was very variable, according to the substance weighed. The word
  means simply a heavy burden, from A.&nbsp;S. <i>hlæst</i>, a burden, connected
  with <i>hladan</i>, to load; so that <i>last</i> and <i>load</i> are
  alike in sense. <i>Laste</i>, in the sense of heavy weight, occurs in
  Richard the Redeles, ed. Skeat, iv. 74. <i>Quad</i> is the Old English
  equivalent of the Dutch <i>kwaad</i>, bad, a word in very common use. In
  O.E., <i>þe qued</i> means the evil one, the devil; P. Pl. B. xiv. 189.
  Cf. note to A. 4357. The omission of the word <i>of</i> before
  <i>quad</i> may be illustrated by the expression 'four score years,'
  i.&nbsp;e. <i>of</i> years.</p>

  <p>1630. 'The monk put an ape in the man's hood, and in his wife's too.'
  We should now say, he made him look like an ape. The contents of the
  <i>hood</i> would be, properly, the man's head and face; but neighbours
  seemed to see peeping from it an ape rather than a man. It is a way of
  saying that he made a dupe of him. In the Milleres Tale (A. 3389), a girl
  is said to have made her lover <i>an ape</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a dupe; an expression
  which recurs in the Chanones Yemannes Tale, G. 1313. Spenser probably
  borrowed the expression from this very passage; it occurs in his Faerie
  Queene, iii. 9. 31:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p style="margin-left:10.4em">'Thus was <i>the ape</i>,</p>

  <p>1632. 'Never entertain monks any more.'</p>

  <p>1637. See the description of the Prioress in the Prologue, A. 118.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Prioresses Tale.</b></p>

  <p>For general remarks upon this Tale, see vol. iii. p. 421.</p>

  <p>1643. Cf. Ps. viii. 1-2. The Vulgate version has&mdash;'Domine Dominus
  noster, quam admirabile est nomen tuum in uniuersa terra! Quoniam eleuata
  est magnificentia tua super caelos! Ex ore infantium et lactentium
  perfecisti laudem,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1650. <i>can or may</i>, know how to, or have ability to do.</p>

  <p>1651. The 'white lily' was the token of Mary's perpetual virginity.
  See this explained at length in Rock, Church of our Fathers, iii.
  245.</p>

  <p>1655. 'For she herself is honour, and, next after her Son, the root of
  bounty, and the help (or profit) of souls.'</p>

  <p>So also in st. 2 of an Alliterative Hymn in Warton, Hist. Eng. Poetry,
  ed. Hazlitt, ii. 284.</p>

  <p>1659. 'That, through thy humility, didst draw down from the Deity the
  Spirit that alighted in thee.'</p>

  <p>1660. <i>thalighte</i> = <i>thee alighte</i>, the two words being run
  into one. Such agglutination is more common when the def. art. occurs, or
  with the word <i>to</i>; cf. <i>Texpounden</i> in B. 1716.</p>

  <p>1661. <i>lighte</i> may mean either (1) cheered, lightened; or (2)
  illuminated. Tyrwhitt and Richardson both take the latter view; but the
  following passage, in which <i>hertes</i> occurs, makes the former the
  more probable:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1668. <i>goost biforn,</i> goest before, dost anticipate. <i>of</i>,
  by. The eighth stanza of the Seconde Nonnes Tale (G. 50-56) closely
  resembles ll. 1664-70; being imitated from the same passage in Dante.</p>

  <p>1677. <i>Gydeth</i>, guide ye. The plural number is used, as a token
  of respect, in addressing superiors. By a careful analysis of the words
  <i>thou</i> and <i>ye</i> in the Romance of William of Palerne, I deduced
  the following results, which are generally true in Mid. English.
  '<i>Thou</i> is the language of a lord to a servant, of an equal to an
  equal, and expresses also companionship, love, permission, defiance,
  scorn, threatening: whilst <i>ye</i> is the language of a servant to a
  lord, and of compliment, and further expresses honour, submission, or
  entreaty. <i>Thou</i> is used with singular verbs, and the possessive
  pronoun <i>thine</i>; but <i>ye</i> requires plural verbs, and the
  possessive <i>your</i>.'&mdash;Pref. to Will. of Palerne, ed. Skeat, p.
  xlii. Cf. Abbott's Shakespearian Grammar, sect. 231.</p>

  <p>1678. <i>Asie</i>, Asia; probably used, as Tyrwhitt suggests, in the
  sense of Asia Minor, as in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>

  <p>1679. <i>a Iewerye</i>, a Jewry, i.&nbsp;e. a Jews' quarter. In many towns
  there was formerly a Jews' quarter, distinguished by a special name.
  There is still an <i>Old Jewry</i> in London. In John vii. 1 the word is
  used as equivalent to <i>Judea</i>, as also in other passages in the
  Bible and in Shakesp. Rich. II, ii. 1. 55. Chaucer (House of Fame, 1435)

  <p>Thackeray uses the word with an odd effect in his Ballad of 'The White
  Squall.' See also note to B. 1749.</p>

  <p>1681. <i>vilanye.</i> So the six MSS.; Hl. has <i>felonye</i>,
  wrongly. In the margin of the Ellesmere MS. is written 'turpe lucrum,'
  i.&nbsp;e. vile gain, which is evidently the sense intended by <i>lucre of
  vilanye</i>, here put for <i>villanous lucre</i> or <i>filthy lucre</i>,
  by poetical freedom of diction. See Chaucer's use of <i>vilanye</i> in
  the Prologue, A. 70 and A. 726.</p>

  <p>1684. <i>free</i>, unobstructed. People could ride and walk through,
  there being no barriers against horses, and no termination in a <i>cul de
  sac</i>. Cf. Troilus, ii. 616-8.</p>

  <p>1687. <i>Children an heep</i>, a heap or great number of children.
  <i>Of</i> is omitted before <i>children</i> as it is before <i>quad
  yere</i> in B. 1628. For <i>heep</i>, see Prologue, A. 575.</p>

  <p>1689. <i>maner doctrine</i>, kind of learning, i.&nbsp;e. reading and
  singing, as explained below. Here again <i>of</i> is omitted, as is usual
  in M.E. after the word <i>maner</i>; as&mdash;'In another <i>maner</i>
  name,' Rob. of Glouc. vol. i. p. 147; 'with somme <i>manere</i> crafte,'
  P. Plowman, B. v. 25: 'no <i>maner</i> wight,' Ch. Prol. A. 71; &amp;c.
  See Mätzner, Englische Grammatik, ii. 2. 313. <i>men used</i>, people
  used; equivalent to <i>was used</i>. Note this use of <i>men</i> in the
  same sense as the French <i>on</i>, or German <i>man</i>. This is an
  excellent instance, as the poet does not refer to <i>men</i> at all, but
  to <i>children</i>. Moreover, <i>men</i> (spelt <i>me</i> in note to B.
  1702) is an attenuated form of the sing. <i>man</i>, and not the usual
  plural.</p>

  <p>1693. <i>clergeon</i>, not 'a young clerk' merely, as Tyrwhitt says,
  but a happily chosen word implying that he was a chorister as well.
  Ducange gives&mdash;'<i>Clergonus</i>, junior clericus, vel puer
  choralis; jeune clerc, petit clerc ou enfant de ch&oelig;ur'; see Migne's
  edition. And Cotgrave has&mdash;'<i>Clergeon</i>, a singing man, or
  Quirester in a Queer [choir].' It means therefore 'a chorister-boy.' Cf.
  Span. <i>clerizon</i>, a chorister, singing-boy; see New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>1694. <i>That</i>, as for whom. A London street-boy would
  say&mdash;'<i>which</i> he was used to go to school.' <i>That ... his</i>
  = whose.</p>

  <p>1695. <i>wher-as</i>, where that, where. So in Shakespeare, 2 Hen. VI.
  i. 2. 58; Spenser, F.&nbsp;Q. i. 4. 38. See Abbott's Shakesp. Grammar, sect.
  135. <i>thimage</i>, the image; alluding to an image of the Virgin placed
  by the wayside, as is so commonly seen on the continent.</p>

  <p>1698. <i>Ave Marie</i>; so in Spenser, F. Q. i. 1. 35. The words
  were&mdash;'Aue Maria, gratia plena; Dominus tecum; benedicta tu in
  mulieribus, et benedictus fructus uentris tui. Amen.' See the English
  version in Specimens of Early English, ed. Morris and Skeat, p. 106. It
  was made up from Luke i. 28 and i. 42. Sometimes the word <i>Jesus</i>
  was added after <i>tui</i>, and, at a later period, an additional
  clause&mdash;'Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc
  et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.' See Rock, Church of our Fathers, iii.
  315; and iii. pt. 2, 134. <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  ab incunabulis apparuit. Nam infans, cum reliquas dies lac nutricis

  this beginning, but the one meant is perhaps one of five stanzas printed
  in Hymni Latini Medii Ævi, ed. F. J. Mone, vol. ii. p. 200, from a St.
  Gallen MS. no. 452, p. 141, of the thirteenth century. The first and last
  stanzas were sung in the Marian Antiphon, from the Saturday evening
  before the 1st Sunday in Advent to Candlemas day. In l. 4 we have the
  <i>salutation</i> which Chaucer mentions (l. 1723), and in the last
  stanza is the prayer (l. 1724). These two stanzas are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Alma redemptoris mater,</p>
      <p>quam de caelis misit pater</p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">propter salutem gentium;</p>
      <p>tibi dicunt omnes "aue!"</p>

      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">peccatorum miserere.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is another anthem that would suit almost equally well, but
  hardly comes so near to Chaucer's description. It occurs in the Roman
  Breviary, ed. 1583, p. 112, and was said at compline from Advent eve to
  Candlemas day, like the other; cf. l. 1730. The words are:&mdash; <!--

  <p>In the Myrour of Our Lady, ed. Blunt, p. 174, an English translation
  of the latter anthem is given, with the heading 'Alma redemptoris
  mater.'</p>

  <p>1709. <i>antiphoner</i>, anthem-book. 'The Antiphoner, or Lyggar, was
  always a large codex, having in it not merely the words, but the music
  and the tones, for all the invitatories, the hymns, responses, versicles,
  collects, and little chapters, besides whatever else belonged to the
  solemn chanting of masses and lauds, as well as the smaller canonical
  hours'; Rock, Church of our Fathers, v. 3, pt. 2, p. 212.</p>

  <p>1710. <i>ner and ner</i>, nearer and nearer. The phrase <i>come neor
  and neor</i> (= come nearer and nearer) occurs in King Alisaunder, in
  Weber's Metrical Romances, l. 599.</p>

  <p>1713. <i>was to seye</i>, was to mean, meant. <i>To seye</i> is the
  gerundial or dative infinitive; see Morris, Hist. Outlines of English
  Accidence, sect. 290.</p>

  <p>1716. <i>Texpounden</i>, to expound. So also <i>tallege</i> = to
  allege, Kn. Ta., A. 3000 (Harl. MS.); <i>tespye</i> = to espy, Nonne Pr.
  Ta., B. 4478. See note to l. 1733.</p>

  <p>1726. <i>can but smal</i>, know but little. Cf. 'the compiler is
  <i>smal</i> learned'; Old Plays, ed. Hazlitt, i. 10.&mdash;M. Cf.
  <i>coude</i> = knew, in l. 1735.</p>

  <p>1733. <i>To honoure</i>; this must be read <i>tonóure</i>, like
  <i>texpounden</i> in l. 1716.</p>

  <p>1739. <i>To scholeward</i>; cf. <i>From Bordeaux ward</i> in the
  Prologue, A. 397.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>1749. The feeling against Jews seems to have been very bitter, and
  there are numerous illustrations of this. In Gower's Conf. Amant. bk.
  vii, ed. Pauli, iii. 194, a Jew is represented as saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>In Piers the Plowman, B. xviii. 104, Faith reproves the Jews, and says
  to them&mdash;</p>

  <p>See also P. Pl., C. v. 194. Usury was forbidden by the canon law, and
  those who practised it, chiefly Jews and Lombards, were held to <!-- Page
  179 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>[179]</span>be
  grievous sinners. Hence the character of Shylock, and of Marlowe's Jew of
  Malta. Cf. note on the Jews in England in the Annals of England, p.
  162.</p>

  <p>1751. <i>honest</i>, honourable; as in the Bible, Rom. xii. 17,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1752. <i>swich</i>, such. The sense here bears out the formation of
  the word from <i>so-like</i>.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>1753. <i>your</i>, of you. Shakespeare has 'in <i>your</i> despite,'
  Cymb. i. 6. 135; 'in <i>thy</i> despite,' 1 Hen. VI, iv. 7. 22.
  <i>Despite</i> is used, like the Early and Middle English <i>maugre</i>,
  with a genitive; as <i>maugre þin</i>, in spite of thee, in Havelok, ll.
  1128, 1789.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>1754. 'Which is against the respect due to your law.' Cf. 'spretaeque
  iniuria formae'; Æneid, i. 27.</p>

  <p>1762. <i>Wardrobe</i>, privy. Godefroy's O. F. Dict. shews that
  <i>garderobe</i> meant not only a wardrobe, or place for keeping robes,
  &amp;c., but also any small chamber; hence the sense. See Cotgrave.</p>

  <p>1764. 'O accursed folk (composed) of Herods wholly new.'</p>

  <p>1766. 'Murder will out'; a proverb; see B. 4242.</p>

  <p>1769. <i>Souded to</i>, confirmed in. From O. F. <i>souder</i>, Lat.
  <i>solidare</i>, whence E. <i>solder</i>. Wyclif's later version
  has&mdash;'hise leggis and hise feet weren <i>sowdid</i> togidere'; Acts,
  iii. 7. The reference in ll. 1770-5 is to Rev. xiv. 3, 4.</p>

  <p>1793. <i>Iesu.</i> This word is written 'Ihu' in E. Hn. Cm.; and 'ihc'
  in Cp. Pt. Ln.; in both cases there is a stroke through the <i>h</i>.
  This is frequently printed <i>Ihesu</i>, but the retention of <i>h</i> is
  unnecessary. It is not really an <i>h</i> at all, but the Greek <span
  class="grk">&Eta;</span>, meaning <i>long e</i> (&#x113;). So, also, in
  'ihc,' the <i>c</i> is not the Latin <i>c</i>, but the Gk. C, meaning
  <span class="grk">&Sigma;</span> or <i>s</i>; and <i>ihc</i> are the
  first three letters of the word <span title="IÊSOUS" class="grk"
  >&Iota;&Eta;&Sigma;&Omicron;&Upsilon;&Sigma;</span> = <span
  title="iêsous" class="grk"
  >&iota;&eta;&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span> = iesus.
  <i>Iesu</i>, as well as <i>Iesus</i>, was used as a nominative, though
  really the genitive or vocative case. At a later period, <i>ihs</i>
  (still with a stroke through the <i>h</i>) was written for <i>ihc</i> as
  a contraction of <i>iesus</i>. By an odd error, a new meaning was
  invented for these letters, and common belief treated them as the
  initials of three Latin words, viz. Iesus Hominum Salvator. But as the
  stroke through the <i>h</i> or mark of contraction still remained
  unaccounted for, it was turned into a cross! Hence the common symbol
  I.H.S. with the small cross in the upper part of the middle letter. The
  wrong interpretation is still the favourite one, all errors being
  long-lived. Another common contraction is <i>Xpc.</i>, where <i>all</i>
  the letters are Greek. The <i>x</i> is <i>ch</i> (<span
  class="grk">&chi;</span>), the <i>p</i> is <i>r</i> (<span
  class="grk">&rho;</span>), and <i>c</i> is <i>s</i>, so that <i>Xpc</i> =
  <i>chrs</i>, the contraction for <i>christus</i> or Christ. This is less
  common in decoration, and no false interpretation has been found for
  it.</p>

  <p>1794. <i>inwith</i>, within. This form occurs in E. Hn. Pt. Ln.; the
  rest have <i>within</i>. Again, in the Merchant's Tale (E. 1944), MSS. E.
  Hn. Cm. Hl. have the form <i>inwith</i>. It occurs in the legend of St.
  Katharine, ed. Morton, l. 172; in Sir Perceval (Thornton Romances), l.
  611; in Alliterative Poems, ed. Morris, A. 970; and in Palladius on
  Husbandry, ed. Lodge, iii. 404. Dr. Morris says it was <!-- Page 180
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>[180]</span>(like
  <i>utwith</i> = without) originally peculiar to the Northern dialect. See
  the Glossary, and the note to l. 2159 below (p. 202).</p>

  <p>1805. <i>coomen</i>; so in E. Hn.; <i>comen</i> in Pt. Cp. But it is
  the past tense = came. The spelling <i>comen</i> for the <i>past</i>
  tense plural is very common in Early English, and we even find <i>com</i>
  in the singular. Thus, in l. 1807, the Petworth MS. has 'He come,'
  equivalent to 'coom,' the <i>o</i> being long. But <i>herieth</i> in l.
  1808 is a <i>present</i> tense.</p>

  <p>1814. <i>nexte</i>, nighest, as in Kn. Ta. A. 1413. So also
  <i>hext</i> = highest, as in the Old Eng. proverb&mdash;'When bale is
  hext, then bote is next,' i.&nbsp;e. 'when woe is highest, help is nighest.'
  <i>Next</i> is for <i>neh-est</i>, and <i>hext</i> is for
  <i>heh-est</i>.</p>

  <p>1817. <i>newe Rachel</i>, second Rachel, as we should now say;
  referring to Matt. ii. 18.</p>

  <p>1819. <i>dooth for to sterve</i>, causes to die. So also in l. 1823,
  <i>dide hem drawe</i> = caused them to be drawn.</p>

  <p>1822. Evidently a proverb; compare Boeth. bk. iv. pr. 1. 37-40 (vol.
  ii. p. 93); and note to P. Plowman, C. v. 140.</p>

  <p>1826. The body occupied the place of honour. 'The bier, if the
  deceased had been a <i>clerk</i>, went into the chancel; if a layman, and
  not of high degree, the bearers set it down in the nave, hard by the
  church-door'; Rock, Ch. of our Fathers, ii. 472. He cites the Sarum
  Manual, fol. c.</p>

  <p>1827. <i>the abbot</i>; pronounced <i>thabbòt</i>. <i>covent</i>,
  convent; here used for the monks who composed the body over which the
  abbot presided. So in Shakespeare, Hen. VIII, iv. 2. 18&mdash;'where the
  reverend abbot, With all his <i>covent</i>, honourably received him.' The
  form <i>covent</i> is Old French, still preserved in <i>Covent
  Garden</i>.</p>

  <p>1835. <i>halse</i>; two MSS. consulted by Tyrwhitt read
  <i>conjure</i>, a mere gloss, caught from the line above. Other examples
  of <i>halse</i> in the sense of <i>conjure</i> occur. 'Ich <i>halsi</i>
  þe o godes nome' = I conjure thee in God's name; St. Marherete, ed.
  Cockayne, p. 17. Again, in Joseph of Arimathie, ed. Skeat, l.
  400&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Vppon þe hei&#x21D;e trinite · I <i>halse</i> þe to telle'&mdash;</p>

  <p>which closely resembles the present passage.</p>

  <p>1838. <i>to my seminge</i>, i.&nbsp;e. as it appears to me.</p>

  <p>1840. 'And, in the ordinary course of nature.'</p>

  <p>1843. <i>Wil</i>, wills, desires. So in Matt. ix. 13, I <i>will</i>
  have mercy = I require mercy; Gk. <span title="eleon thelô" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&lambda;&epsilon;&omicron;&nu;
  &theta;&#x1F73;&lambda;&omega;</span>; Vulgate, misericordiam uolo. Cf.
  B. 45.</p>

  <p>1848. In the Ellesmere MS. (which has the metrical pauses marked) the
  pause in this line is marked after <i>lyf</i>. The word <i>sholde</i> is
  dissyllabic here, having more than the usual emphasis; it has the force
  of <i>ought to</i>. Cf. E. 1146.</p>

  <p>1852. In the Cursor Mundi, 1373-6, Seth is told to place three pippins
  under the root of Adam's tongue.</p>

  <p>1857. <i>now</i> is used in the sense of <i>take notice that</i>,
  without any <!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page181"></a>[181]</span>reference to <i>time</i>. There is no
  necessity to alter the reading to <i>than</i>, as proposed by Tyrwhitt.
  See Mätzner, Engl. Gram. ii. 2. 346, who refers to Luke ii. 41, John i.
  44, and quotes an apt passage from Maundeville's Travels, p.
  63&mdash;'<i>Now</i> aftre that men han visited the holy places,
  <i>thanne</i> will they turnen toward Jerusalem.' In A.&nbsp;S. the word used
  in similar cases is <i>s&#x14D;þl&#x12B;ce</i> = soothly, verily.</p>

  <p>1873. <i>Ther</i>, where. <i>leve</i>, grant. No two words have been
  more confused by editors than <i>lene</i> and <i>leue</i>. Though
  sometimes written much alike in MSS., they are easily distinguished by a
  little care. The A. S. <i>l&#x233;fan</i> or <i>l&#x113;fan</i>, spelt
  <i>lefe</i> in the Ormulum (vol. i. p. 308), answers to the Germ.
  <i>erlauben</i>, and means <i>grant</i> or <i>permit</i>, but it can only
  be used in certain cases. The verb <i>lene</i>, A.&nbsp;S. <i>l&#x1E3;nan</i>,
  now spelt <i>lend</i>, often means to give or grant in Early English, but
  again only in certain cases. I quote from my article on these words in
  Notes and Queries, 4 Ser. ii. 127&mdash;'It really makes all the
  difference whether we are speaking of to <i>grant</i> a thing to a
  person, or to <i>grant</i> that a thing may happen. "God <i>lene</i> thee
  grace," means "God <i>grant</i> thee grace," where to grant is to
  <i>impart</i>; but "God <i>leue</i> we may do right" means "God
  <i>grant</i> we may do right," where to <i>grant</i> is to permit....
  Briefly, <i>lene</i> requires <i>an accusative case</i> after it,
  <i>leue</i> is followed by <i>a dependent clause</i>.' <i>Lene</i> occurs
  in Chaucer, Prol. A. 611, Milleres Tale, A. 3777, and elsewhere. Examples
  of <i>leue</i> in Chaucer are (1) in the present passage, misprinted
  <i>lene</i> by Tyrwhitt, Morris, Wright, and Bell, though five of our
  MSS. have <i>leue</i>; (2) in the Freres Tale, D. 1644, printed
  <i>lene</i> by Tyrwhitt (l. 7226), <i>leene</i> by Morris, <i>leeve</i>
  by Wright and Bell; (3) (4) (5) in three passages in Troilus and Criseyde
  (ii. 1212, iii. 56, v. 1750), where Tyrwhitt prints <i>leve</i>, but
  unluckily recants his opinion in his Glossary, whilst Morris prints
  <i>lene</i>. For other examples see Stratmann, s.&nbsp;v. <i>lænan</i> and
  <i>leven</i>.</p>

  <p>It may be remarked that <i>leve</i> in Old English has several other
  senses; such as (1) to believe; (2) to live; (3) to leave; (4) to remain;
  (5) leave, <i>sb.</i>; (6) dear, <i>adj.</i> I give an example in which
  the first, sixth, and third of these senses occur in one and the same
  line:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1874. <i>Hugh of Lincoln.</i> The story of Hugh of Lincoln, a boy
  supposed to have been murdered at Lincoln by the Jews, is placed by
  Matthew Paris under the year 1255. Thynne, in his Animadversions upon
  Speght's editions of Chaucer (p. 45 of the reprint of the E.E.T.S.),
  addresses Speght as follows&mdash;'You saye, that in the 29 Henry iii.
  eightene Jewes were broughte fro<i>m</i> Lincolne, and hanged for
  crucyfyinge a childe of eight yeres olde. Whiche facte was in the 39 Hen.
  iii., so that yo<i>u</i> mighte verye well haue sayed, that the same
  childe of eighte yeres olde was the same hughe of Lincolne; of whiche
  name there were twoe, viz. thys younger Seinte Hughe, and Seinte Hughe
  bishoppe of Lincolne, which dyed in the yere 1200, long before this <!--
  Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>[182]</span>little seinte hughe. And to prove that
  this childe of eighte yeres olde and that yonge hughe of Lincolne were
  but one; I will sett downe two auctoryties out of Mathewe Paris and
  Walsinghame, wherof the fyrste wryteth, that in the yere of Christe 1255,
  being the 39 of Henry the 3, a childe called Hughe was sleyne by the
  Jewes at Lyncolne, whose lamentable historye he delyvereth at large; and
  further, in the yere 1256, being 40 Hen. 3, he sayeth, Dimissi sunt
  quieti 24 Judei á Turri London., qui ibidem infames tenebantur compediti
  pro crucifixione sancti Hugonis Lincolniae: All which Thomas Walsingham,
  in Hypodigma Neustriae, confirmeth: sayinge, Ao. 1255, Puer quidam
  Christianus, nomine Hugo, à Judeis captus, in opprobriu<i>m</i>
  Christiani nominis crudeliter est crucifixus.' There are several ballads
  in French and English, on the subject of Hugh of Lincoln, which were
  collected by M. F. Michel, and published at Paris in 1834, with the
  title&mdash;'Hugues de Lincoln, Recueil de Ballades Anglo-Normandes et
  Ecossoises relatives au Meurtre de cet Enfant.' The day of St. Hugh,
  bishop of Lincoln, is Aug. 27; that of St. Hugh, boy and martyr, is June
  29. See also Brand's Pop. Antiq. ed. Ellis, i. 431. And see vol. iii. p.
  423.</p>

  <p>1875. <i>With</i>, by. See numerous examples in Mätzner, Engl. Gram.
  ii. 1. 419, amongst which we may especially notice&mdash;'Stolne is he
  <i>with</i> Iues'; Towneley Mysteries, p. 290.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Prologue to Sir Thopas.</b></p>

  <p>1881. <i>miracle</i>, pronounced <i>míracl'</i>. Tyrwhitt omits
  <i>al</i>, and turns the word into <i>mirácle</i>, unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>1883. <i>hoste</i> is so often an evident dissyllable (see l. 1897),
  that there is no need to insert <i>to</i> after it, as in Tyrwhitt. In
  fact, <i>bigan</i> is seldom followed by <i>to</i>.</p>

  <p>1885. <i>what man artow</i>, what sort of a man art thou?</p>

  <p>1886. <i>woldest finde</i>, wouldst like to find. We learn from this
  passage, says Tyrwhitt, that Chaucer 'was used to look much upon the
  ground; that he was of a corpulent habit; and reserved in his behaviour.'
  We cannot be quite sure that the poet is serious; but these inferences
  are probably correct; cf. Lenvoy a Scogan, 31.</p>

  <p>1889. <i>war you</i>, mind yourselves, i.&nbsp;e. make way.</p>

  <p>1890. <i>as wel as I</i>; said ironically. Chaucer is as corpulent as
  the host himself. See note to l. 1886 above.</p>

  <p>1891. <i>were</i>, would be. <i>tenbrace</i>, to embrace. In the
  Romaunt of the Rose, true lovers are said to be always lean; but
  deceivers are often fat enough:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>It is no wonder though they be fat'; l. 2689.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>1893. <i>elvish</i>, elf-like, akin to the fairies; alluding to his
  absent looks <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>[183]</span>and reserved manner. See <i>Elvish</i> in
  the Glossary, and cf. 'this <i>elvish</i> nyce lore'; Can. Yeom. Tale, G.
  842. Palsgrave has&mdash;'I waxe <i>eluysshe</i>, nat easye to be dealed
  with, <i>Ie deuiens mal traictable</i>.'</p>

  <p>1900. <i>Ye</i>, yea. The difference in Old English between <i>ye</i>
  and <i>yis</i> (yes) is commonly well marked. <i>Ye</i> is the weaker
  form, and merely assents to what the last speaker says; but <i>yis</i> is
  an affirmative of great force, often followed by an oath, or else it
  answers a question containing a <i>negative</i> particle, as in the House
  of Fame, 864. Cf. B. 4006 below.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Tale of Sir Thopas.</b></p>

  <p>In the black-letter editions, this Tale is called 'The ryme of Sir
  Thopas,' a title copied by Tyrwhitt, but not found in the seven best MSS.
  This word is now almost universally misspelt <i>rhyme</i>, owing to
  confusion with the Greek <i>rhythm</i>; but this misspelling is
  <i>never</i> found in old MSS. or in early printed books, nor has any
  example yet been found earlier than the reign of Elizabeth. The old
  spelling <i>rime</i> is confirmed by the A.&nbsp;S. <i>r&#x12B;m</i>, Icel.
  <i>rím</i>, Dan. <i>rim</i>, Swed. <i>rim</i>, Germ. <i>reim</i>, Dutch
  <i>rijm</i>, Old Fr. <i>rime</i>, &amp;c. Confusion with <i>rime</i>,
  hoarfrost, is impossible, as the context always decides which is meant;
  but it is worth notice that it is the latter word which has the better
  title to an <i>h</i>, as the A.&nbsp;S. word for hoarfrost is
  <i>hr&#x12B;m</i>. Tyrwhitt, in his edition of Chaucer, attempted two
  reforms in spelling, viz. <i>rime</i> for <i>rhyme</i>, and <i>coud</i>
  for <i>could</i>. Both are most rational, but probably unattainable.</p>

  <p><i>Thopas.</i> In the Supplement to Ducange we
  find&mdash;'<i>Thopasius</i>, pro Topasius, Acta S. Wencesl. tom. 7.
  Sept. p. 806, col. 1.' The Lat. <i>topazius</i> is our <i>topaz</i>. The
  whole poem is a burlesque (see vol. iii. p. 423), and <i>Sir Topaz</i> is
  an excellent title for such a gem of a knight. The name <i>Topyas</i>
  occurs in Richard Coer de Lion, ed. Weber, ii. 11, as that of a sister of
  King Richard I; but no such name is known to history.</p>

  <p>The metre is that commonly used before and in Chaucer's time by
  long-winded ballad-makers. Examples of it occur in the Romances of Sir
  Percevall, Sir Isumbras, Sir Eglamour, and Sir Degrevant (in the Thornton
  Romances, ed. Halliwell), and in several romances in the Percy Folio MS.
  (ed. Hales and Furnivall), such as Libius Disconius, Sir Triamour, Sir
  Eglamour, Guy and Colbrande, The Grene Knight, &amp;c.; see also Amis and
  Amiloun, and Sir Amadas in Weber's Metrical Romances; and Lybeaus
  Disconus, The King of Tars, Le Bone Florence, Emare, The Erle of Tolous,
  and Horn Childe in Ritson's collection. To point out Chaucer's sly
  imitations of phrases, &amp;c. would be a long task; the reader would
  gain the best idea of his manner by reading any one of these old ballads.
  To give a few illustrations is all that can be attempted here; I refer
  the reader to Prof. Kölbing's elaborate article in the Englische Studien,
  xi. 495, for further information; also to the dissertation by C. J.
  Bennewitz mentioned in vol. iii. <!-- Page 184 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>[184]</span>p. 424. It is
  remarkable that we find in Weber a ballad called 'The Hunting of the
  Hare,' which is a pure burlesque, like Chaucer's, but a little broader in
  tone and more obviously comic.</p>

  <p>1902. <i>Listeth, lordes</i>, hearken, sirs. This is the usual style
  of beginning. For example, Sir Bevis begins&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Lordynges, lystenyth</i>, grete and smale';</p>

  their silence and attention, is a manifest indication that these ancient
  pieces were originally sung to the harp, or recited before grand
  assemblies, upon solemn occasions'; Obs. on F. Queene, p. 248.</p>

  <p>1904. <i>solas</i>, mirth. See Prol. l. 798. 'This word is often used
  in describing the festivities of elder days. "She and her ladyes called
  for their minstrells, and <i>solaced</i> themselves with the disports of
  dauncing"; Leland, Collectanea, v. 352. So in the Romance of Ywaine and

  <p>1905. <i>gent</i>, gentle, gallant. Often applied to ladies, in the
  sense of pretty. The first stanzas in Sir Isumbras and Sir Eglamour are
  much in the same strain as this stanza.</p>

  <p>1910. <i>Popering.</i> 'Poppering, or Poppeling, was the name of a
  parish in the Marches of Calais. Our famous antiquary Leland was once
  rector of it. See Tanner, Bib. Brit. in v.
  <i>Leland</i>.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. Here <i>Calais</i> means the district,
  not the town. <i>Poperinge</i> has a population of about 10,500, and is
  situate about 26 miles S. by W. from Ostend, in the province of Belgium
  called West Flanders, very near the French 'marches,' or border. Ypres
  (see A. 448) is close beside it. <i>place</i>, the mansion or chief house
  in the town. Dr. Pegge, in his Kentish Glossary, (Eng. Dial. Soc.),
  has&mdash;'<i>Place</i>, that is, the manor-house. Hearne, in his pref.
  to Antiq. of Glastonbury, p. xv, speaks of a <i>manour-place</i>.' He
  refers also to Strype's Annals, cap. xv.</p>

  <p>1915. <i>payndemayn.</i> 'The very finest and the <i>whitest</i> [kind
  of bread] that was known, was <i>simnel-bread</i>, which ... was as
  commonly known under the name of <i>pain-demayn</i> (afterwards corrupted
  into [<i>painmain</i> or] <i>payman</i>); a word which has given
  considerable trouble to Tyrwhitt and other commentators on Chaucer, but
  which means no <!-- Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page185"></a>[185]</span>more than "bread of our Lord," from the
  figure of our Saviour, or the Virgin Mary, impressed upon each round flat
  loaf, as is still the usage in Belgium with respect to certain rich cakes
  much admired there'; Chambers, Book of Days, i. 119. The Liber Albus (ed.
  Riley, p. 305) speaks of '<i>demesne</i> bread, known as <i>demeine</i>,'
  which Mr. Riley annotates by&mdash;'<i>Panis Dominicus</i>. Simnels made
  of the very finest flour were thus called, from an impression upon them
  of the effigy of our Saviour.' Tyrwhitt refers to the poem of the Freiris
  of Berwick, in the Maitland MS., in which occur the expressions <i>breid
  of mane</i> and <i>mane breid</i>. It occurs also in Sir Degrevant
  (Thornton Romances, p. 235):&mdash;</p>

  <p>'<i>Paynemayn</i> prevayly Sche brou&#x21D;th fram the pantry,'
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>It is mentioned as a delicacy by Gower, Conf. Amantis, bk. vi. (ed.
  Pauli, iii. 22).</p>

  <p>1917. <i>rode</i>, complexion. <i>scarlet in grayn</i>, i.&nbsp;e. scarlet
  dyed in grain, or of a fast colour. Properly, to dye <i>in</i> grain
  meant to dye <i>with</i> grain, i.&nbsp;e. with cochineal. In fact, Chaucer
  uses the phrase '<i>with greyn</i>' in the epilogue to the Nonne Prestes
  Tale; B. 4649. See the long note in Marsh's Lectures on the English
  Language, ed. Smith, pp. 54-62, and the additional note on p. 64. Cf.
  Shak. Tw. Nt. i. 5. 255.</p>

  <p>1920. <i>saffroun</i>; i.&nbsp;e. of a yellow colour. Cf. Bottom's
  description of beards&mdash;'I will discharge it in either your
  straw-colour beard, your orange-tawney beard, your purple-in-grain beard,
  or your French-crown-colour beard, <i>your perfect yellow</i>'; Mids. Nt.
  Dr. i. 2. In Lybeaus Disconus (ed. Ritson, Met. Rom. ii. 6, or ed.
  Kaluza, l. 139) a dwarf's beard is described as 'yelow as ony wax.'</p>

  <p>1924. <i>ciclatoun</i>, a costly material. From the O. Fr.
  <i>ciclaton</i>, the name of a costly cloth. [It was early confused with
  the Latin <i>cyclas</i>, which Ducange explains by 'vestis species, et
  panni genus.' The word <i>cyclas</i> occurs in Juvenal (Sat. vi. 259),
  and is explained to mean a robe worn most often by women, and adorned
  with a border of gold or purple; see also Propertius, iv. 7. 40.]
  <i>Ciclatoun</i>, however, is of Eastern origin, as was well suggested in
  the following note by Col. Yule in his edition of Marco Polo, i.
  249:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The term <i>suklát</i> is applied in the Punjab trade-returns to
  <i>broadcloth</i>. Does not this point to the real nature of the
  <i>siclatoun</i> of the Middle Ages? It is, indeed, often spoken of as
  used for banners, which implies that it was not a heavy woollen. But it
  was also a material for ladies' robes, for quilts, leggings, housings,
  pavilions. Michel does not decide what it was, only that it was generally
  <i>red</i> and wrought with gold. Dozy renders it "silk stuff brocaded
  with gold," but this seems conjectural. Dr. Rock says it was a thin
  glossy silken stuff, often with a woof of gold thread, and seems to
  derive it from the Arabic <i>sakl</i>, "polishing" (a sword), which is
  improbable.' Compare the following examples, shewing its use for tents,
  banners, &amp;c.:&mdash; <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Richardson's Pers. and Arab. Dict. (ed. Johnson, 1829), p. 837, gives:
  'Pers. <i>saqlat&#x16B;n</i>, scarlet cloth (whence Arab.
  <i>siql&#x101;t</i>, a fine painted or figured cloth)'; and the
  derivation is probably (as given in the New E. Dict.) from the very Pers.
  word which has given us the word <i>scarlet</i>; so that it was
  originally named from its colour. It was afterwards applied to various
  kinds of costly materials, which were sometimes embroidered with gold.
  See <i>Ciclaton</i> in Godefroy, and in the New E. Dict.; and
  <i>Scarlet</i> in my Etym. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>The matter has been much confused by a mistaken notion of Spenser's.
  Not observing that Sir Thopas is here described in his robes of
  <i>peace</i>, not in those of <i>war</i> (as in a later stanza), he
  followed Thynne's spelling, viz. <i>chekelatoun</i>, and imagined this to
  mean 'that kind of guilded leather with which they [the Irish] use to
  embroder theyr Irish jackes'; View of the State of Ireland, in Globe
  edition, p. 639, col. 2. And this notion he carried out still more boldly
  in the lines&mdash;</p>

    </div>

  <p>1925. <i>Jane</i>, a small coin. The word is known to be a corruption
  of <i>Genoa</i>, which is spelt <i>Jeane</i> in Hall's Chronicles, fol.
  xxiv. So too we find <i>Janueys</i> and <i>Januayes</i> for
  <i>Genoese</i>. See Bardsley's English Surnames, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Janeway</i>.
  Stow, in his Survey of London, ed. 1599, p. 97, says that some foreigners
  lived in Minchin Lane, who had come from <i>Genoa</i>, and were commonly
  called galley-men, who landed wines, &amp;c. from the galleys at a place
  called 'galley-key' in Thames Street. 'They had a certaine coyne of
  silver amongst themselves, which were half-pence of Genoa, and were
  called <i>galley half-pence</i>. These half-pence were forbidden in the
  13th year of Henry IV, and again by parliament in the 3rd of Henry V, by
  the name of <i>half-pence of Genoa</i>.... Notwithstanding, in my youth,
  I have seen them passe currant,' &amp;c. Chaucer uses the word again in
  the Clerkes Tale (E. 999), and Spenser adopted it from Chaucer; F.&nbsp;Q.
  iii. 7. 58. Mr. Wright observes that 'the <i>siclaton</i> was a rich
  cloth or silk brought from the East, and is therefore appropriately
  mentioned as bought with Genoese coin.'</p>

  <p>1927. <i>for rivéer</i>, towards the river. This appears to be the
  best reading, and we must take <i>for</i> in close connexion with
  <i>ryde</i>; perhaps it <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page187"></a>[187]</span>is a mere imitation of the French <i>en
  riviere</i>. It alludes to the common practice of seeking the river-side,
  because the best sport, in hawking, was with herons and waterfowl.
  Tyrwhitt quotes from Froissart, v. 1. c. 140&mdash;'Le Comte de Flandres
  estoit tousjours <i>en riviere</i>&mdash;un jour advint qu'il alla voller
  <i>en la riviere</i>&mdash;et getta son fauconnier un faucon <i>apres le
  heron</i>.' And again, in c. 210, he says that Edward III 'alloit, chacun

  <p>1942. <i>launcegay</i>, a sort of lance. Gower has the word, Conf.
  Amant. bk. viii. (ed. Pauli, iii. 369). Cowel says its use was prohibited
  by the statute of 7 Rich. II, cap. 13. Camden mentions it in his
  Remaines, p. 209. Tyrwhitt quotes, from Rot. Parl. 29 Hen. VI, n. 8, the
  following&mdash;'And the said Evan then and there with a
  <i>launcegaye</i> smote the said William Tresham throughe the body a
  foote and more, wherof he died.' Sir Walter Raleigh (quoted by
  Richardson) <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page188"></a>[188]</span>says&mdash;'These carried a kind of
  <i>lance de gay</i>, sharp at both ends, which they held in the midst of
  the staff.' But this is certainly a corrupt form. It is no doubt a
  corruption of <i>lancezagay</i>, from the Spanish <i>azagaya</i>, a word
  of Moorish origin. Cotgrave gives&mdash;'<i>Zagaye</i>, a fashion of
  slender, long, and long-headed pike, used by the Moorish horsemen.' It
  seems originally to have been rather a short weapon, a kind of half-pike
  or dart. The Spanish word is well discussed in Dozy, Glossaire des mots
  Espagnols et Portugais dérivés de l'Arabe, 2nd ed. p. 225. The Spanish
  <i>azagaya</i> is for <i>az-zagaya</i>, where <i>az</i> is for the
  definite article <i>al</i>, and <i>zagaya</i> is a Berber or Algerian
  word, not given in the Arabic dictionaries. It is found in Old Spanish of
  the fourteenth century. Dozy quotes from a writer who explains it as a
  Moorish half-pike, and also gives the following passage from Laugier de
  Tassy, Hist. du royaume d'Alger, p. 58&mdash;'Leurs armes sont
  <i>l'azagaye</i>, qui est une espéce de <i>lance courte</i>, qu'ils
  portent toujours à la main.' The Caffre word <i>assagai</i>, in the sense
  of javelin, was simply borrowed from the Portuguese <i>azagaia</i>.</p>

  <p>1949. <i>a sory care</i>, a grievous misfortune. Chaucer does not say
  what this was, but a passage in Amis and Amiloun (ed. Weber, ii. 410)
  makes it probable that Sir Thopas nearly killed his horse, which would
  have been grievous indeed; see l. 1965 below. The passage I allude to is
  as follows:&mdash;</p>

  Grecian mythology between their undoubted parallels, Artemis and
  Persephone.' Chaucer makes Proserpine the 'queen of faerie' in his
  Marchauntes Tale; but at the beginning of the Wyf of Bathes Tale, he
  describes the <i>elf-queen</i> as the queen of the <i>fairies</i>, and
  makes <i>elf</i> and <i>fairy</i> synonymous. Perhaps this
  <i>elf-queen</i> in Sire Thopas (called the <i>queen of fairye</i> in l.
  2004) may have given Spenser the hint for <i>his</i> Faerie <!-- Page 190
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>[190]</span>Queene. But
  the subject is a vast one. See Price's Preface, in Warton's Hist. Eng.
  Poetry, ed. Hazlitt, pp. 30-36; Halliwell's Illustrations of Fairy
  Mythology; Keightley's Fairy Mythology; Warton's Observations on the
  Faerie Queene, sect. ii; Sir W. Scott's ballad of Thomas the Rhymer,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1979. <i>under my gore</i>, within my robe or garment. In l. 2107 (on
  which see the note) we have <i>under wede</i> signifying merely 'in his
  dress.' We have a somewhat similar phrase here, in which, however,
  <i>gore</i> (lit. gusset) is put for the whole robe or garment. That it
  was a mere phrase, appears from other passages. Thus we find <i>under
  gore</i>, under the dress, Owl and Nightingale, l. 515; Reliquiae
  Antiquae, vol. i. p. 244, vol. ii. p. 210; with three more examples in
  the Gloss. to Böddeker's Altenglische Dichtungen des MS. Harl. 2253. In
  one of these a lover addresses his lady as 'geynest under gore,' i.&nbsp;e.
  fairest within a dress. For the exact sense of <i>gore</i>, see note to
  A. 3237.</p>

  <p>1983. <i>In toune</i>, in the town, in the district. But it must not
  be supposed that much <i>sense</i> is intended by this inserted line. It
  is a mere tag, in imitation of some of the romances. Either Chaucer has
  neglected to conform to the new kind of stanza which he now introduces
  (which is most likely), or else three lines have been lost before this
  one. The next three stanzas are longer, viz. of <i>ten</i> lines each, of
  which only the seventh is very short. For good examples of these short
  lines, see Sir Gawayne and the Greene Kny&#x21D;t, ed. Morris; and for a
  more exact account of the metres here employed, see vol. iii. p. 425.</p>

  <p>1993. <i>So wilde.</i> Instead of this short line, Tyrwhitt
  has:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Wherin he soughte North and South,</p>
      <p>And oft he spied with his mouth</p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">In many a forest wilde.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But none of our seven MSS. agrees with this version, nor are these
  lines found in the black-letter editions. The notion of <i>spying</i>
  with one's <i>mouth</i> seems a little too far-fetched.</p>

  <p>1995. This line is supplied from MS. Reg. 17 D. 15, where Tyrwhitt
  found it; but something is so obviously required here, that we must
  insert it to make some sense. It suits the tone of the context to say
  that 'neither wife nor child durst oppose him.' We may, however, bear in
  mind that the meeting of a knight-errant with one of these often preceded
  some great adventure. 'And in the midst of an highway he [Sir Lancelot]
  met a damsel riding on a white palfrey, and there either saluted other.
  Fair damsel, said Sir Lancelot, know ye in this country any adventures?
  Sir knight, said that damsel, here are adventures near hand, and thou
  durst prove them'; Sir T. Malory, Morte Arthur, bk. vi. cap. vii. The
  result was that Lancelot fought with Sir Turquine, and defeated him. Soon
  after, he was 'required of a damsel to heal her brother'; and again, 'at
  the request of a lady' he recovered a falcon; an adventure which ended in
  a fight, as usual. Kölbing points out a parallel line in Sir Guy of
  Warwick, 45-6:&mdash; <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>1998. <i>Olifaunt</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Elephant; a proper name, as Tyrwhitt
  observes, for a giant. Maundeville has the form <i>olyfauntes</i> for
  <i>elephants</i>. By some confusion the M&oelig;so-Goth. <i>ulbandus</i>
  and A.&nbsp;S. <i>olfend</i> are made to signify a <i>camel</i>. Spenser has
  put Chaucer's <i>Olifaunt</i> into his Faerie Queene, bk. iii. c. 7. st.
  48, and makes him the brother of the giantess Argantè, and son of
  Typhoeus and Earth. The following description of a giant is from Libius
  Disconius (Percy Folio MS. vol. ii. p. 465):&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Another giant, 20 feet long, and 2 ells broad, with two boar's tusks,
  and also with brows like bristles of a swine, appears in Octouian
  Imperator, ed. Weber, iii. 196. See also the alliterative Morte Arthure,
  ed. Brock, p. 33.</p>

  <p>2000. <i>child</i>; see note to l. 2020. <i>Termagaunt</i>; one of the
  idols whom the Saracens (in the medieval romances) are supposed to
  worship. See The King of Tars, ed. Ritson (Met. Rom., ii. 174-182), where
  the Sultan's gods are said to be Jubiter, Jovin (both forms of Jupiter),
  Astrot (Astarte), Mahoun (Mahomet), Appolin (Apollo), Plotoun (Pluto),
  and <i>Tirmagaunt</i>. Lybeaus Disconus (Ritson, Met. Rom. ii. 55) fought
  with a giant 'that levede yn Termagaunt.' The Old French form is
  <i>Tervagant</i>, Ital. <i>Tervagante</i> or <i>Trivigante</i>, as in
  Ariosto. Wheeler, in his Noted Names of Fiction, gives the following
  account&mdash;'Ugo Foscolo says: "<i>Trivigante</i>, whom the
  predecessors of Ariosto always couple with Apollino, is really Diana
  <i>Trivia</i>, the sister of the classical Apollo.".... According to
  Panizzi, <i>Trivagante</i> or <i>Tervagante</i> is the Moon, or Diana, or
  Hecate, <i>wandering under three names</i>. <i>Termagant</i> was an
  imaginary being, supposed by the crusaders, who confounded Mahometans
  with pagans, to be a Mahometan deity. This imaginary personage was
  introduced into early English plays and moralities, and was represented
  as of a most violent character, so that a ranting actor might always
  appear to advantage in it. See Hamlet, iii. 2. 15.' Fairfax, in his
  translation of Tasso (c. i. st. 84), speaks of Termagaunt and Mahound,
  but Tasso mentions 'Macometto' only. See also Spenser, F.&nbsp;Q. vi. 7. 47.
  Hence comes our <i>termagant</i> in the sense of a noisy boisterous
  woman. Shakespeare has&mdash;'that hot <!-- Page 192 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>[192]</span><i>termagant</i> Scot';
  1 Hen. IV., v. 2. 114. Cf. Ritson's note, Met. Rom. iii. 257.</p>

  <p>2002. <i>slee</i>, will slay. In Anglo-Saxon, there being no distinct
  future tense, it is expressed by the present. Cf. <i>go</i> for <i>will
  go</i> in 'we also <i>go</i> with thee'; John xxi. 3.</p>

  <p>2005. <i>simphonye</i>, the name of a kind of tabor. In Ritson's
  Ancient Songs, i. lxiv., is a quotation from Hawkins's Hist. of Music,
  ii. 284, in which that author cites a passage from Batman's translation
  of Bartholomaeus de Proprietatibus Rerum, to the effect that the
  <i>symphonie</i> was 'an instrument of musyke ... made of an holowe tree
  [i.&nbsp;e. piece of wood], closyd in lether in eyther syde; and mynstrels
  beteth it with styckes.' Probably the <i>symphangle</i> was the same
  instrument. In Rob. of Brunne's Handlyng Synne, ll. 4772-3, we
  find:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  </div>

  <p>Godefroy gives the O.&nbsp;F. spellings <i>cifonie</i>, <i>siphonie</i>,
  <i>chifonie</i>, <i>cinfonie</i>, <i>cymphonie</i>, &amp;c.; all clearly
  derived from the Greek <span title="sumphônia" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&upsilon;&mu;&phi;&omega;&nu;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span>; see Luke,
  xv. 25. Cf. Squyre of Lowe Degre, 1070-7.</p>

  <p>2007. <i>al-so mote I thee</i>, as I may thrive; or, as I hope to
  thrive; a common expression. Cf. 'So mote y thee'; Sir Eglamour, ed.
  Halliwell, l. 430; Occleve, De Regimine Principum, st. 620. Chaucer also
  uses 'so thee ik,' i.&nbsp;e. so thrive I, in the Reves Prologue (A. 3864) and
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>2012. <i>Abyen it ful soure</i>, very bitterly shalt thou pay for it.
  There is a confusion between A.&nbsp;S. <i>súr</i>, sour, and A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>sár</i>, sore, in this and similar phrases; both were used once, but
  now we should use <i>sorely</i>, not <i>sourly</i>. In Layamon, l. 8158,
  we find 'þou salt it sore abugge,' thou shalt sorely pay for it; on the
  other hand, we find in P. Plowman, B. ii. 140:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'It shal bisitte &#x21D;owre soules · ful <i>soure</i> atte laste.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So also in the C-text, though the A-text has <i>sore</i>. Note that in
  another passage, P. Plowman, B. xviii. 401, the phrase is&mdash;'Thow
  shalt abye it <i>bittre</i>.' For <i>abyen</i>, see the Glossary.</p>

  <p>2015. <i>fully pryme.</i> See note to Nonne Prestes Tale, B. 4045.
  <i>Prime</i> commonly means the period from 6 to 9 a.m. <i>Fully
  prime</i> refers to the end of that period, or 9 a.m.; and even
  <i>prime</i> alone may be used with the same explicit meaning, as in the
  Nonne Pres. Ta., B. 4387.</p>

  <p>2019. <i>staf-slinge.</i> Tyrwhitt observes that Lydgate describes
  David as armed only 'with a <i>staffe-slynge</i>, voyde of plate and
  mayle.' It certainly means a kind of sling in which additional power was
  gained by fastening the lithe part of it on to the end of a stiff stick.
  <i>Staff-slyngeres</i> are mentioned in the romance of Richard Coer de
  Lion, l. 4454, in Weber's Metrical Romances, ii. 177. In Col. Yule's
  edition of Marco Polo, ii. 122, is a detailed description of the
  artillery engines of the middle ages. They can all be reduced to two
  classes; those <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>[193]</span>which, like the trebuchet and mangonel,
  are enlarged staff-slings, and those which, like the arblast and
  springold, are great cross-bows. Conversely, we might describe a
  staff-sling as a hand-trebuchet.</p>

  <p>2020. <i>child Thopas.</i> <i>Child</i> is an appellation given to
  both knights and squires, in the early romances, at an age when they had
  long passed the period which we now call childhood. A good example is to
  be found in the Erle of Tolous, ed. Ritson, iii. 123:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'He was a feyre chylde, and a bolde,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Compare Romance of 'Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild,' pr. in Ritson,
  iii. 282; the ballad of Childe Waters, &amp;c. Byron, in his preface to
  Childe Harold, says&mdash;'It is almost superfluous to mention that the
  appellation "Childe," as "Childe Waters," "Childe Childers," &amp;c., is
  used as more consonant with the old structure of versification which I
  have adopted.' He adopts, however, the late and artificial metre of
  Spenser.</p>

  <p>2023. A palpable imitation. The first three lines of Sir Bevis of
  Hampton (MS. Camb. Univ. Lib. Ff. ii. 38, leaf 94, back) are&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">I wylle yow synge.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a long passage in Todd's Illustrations to Chaucer, pp. 284-292, it
  is contended that <i>mery</i> signifies sweet, pleasant, agreeable,
  without relation to mirth. Chaucer describes the Frere as wanton and
  <i>merry</i>, Prol. A. 208; he speaks of the <i>merry</i> day, Kn. Ta.
  641 (A. 1499); a <i>merry</i> city, N. P. Ta. 251 (B. 4261); of Arcite
  being told by Mercury to be <i>merry</i>, i.&nbsp;e. of good cheer, Kn. Ta.
  528 (A. 1386); in the Manciple's Tale (H. 138), the crow sings
  <i>merrily</i>, and makes a <i>sweet</i> noise; Chanticleer's voice was
  <i>merrier</i> than the <i>merry</i> organ, N. P. Ta. 31 (B. 4041); the
  'erbe yve' is said to be <i>merry</i>, i.&nbsp;e. pleasant, agreeable, id. 146
  (B. 4156); the Pardoner (Prol. A. 714) sings <i>merrily</i> and loud. We
  must remember, however, that the Host, being 'a <i>mery</i> man,' began
  to speak of '<i>mirthe</i>'; Prol. A. 757, 759. A very early example of
  the use of the word occurs in the song attributed to
  Canute&mdash;'<i>Merie</i> sungen the Muneches binnen Ely,' &amp;c. See
  the phrase '<i>mery</i> men' in l. 2029.</p>

  <p>2028. The phrase <i>to come to toune</i> seems to mean no more than
  simply <i>to return</i>. Cf. Specimens of E. Eng., ed. Morris and Skeat,
  p. 48&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Lenten ys <i>come</i> wiþ loue <i>to toune</i>'&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>which merely means that spring, with its thoughts of love, has
  <i>returned</i>. See the note on that line.</p>

  <p>2034. <i>for paramour</i>, for love; but the <i>par</i>, or else the
  <i>for</i>, is redundant. <i>Iolite</i>, amusement; used ironically in
  the Kn. Ta. 949 (A. 1807). Sir Thopas is going to fight the giant for the
  love and amusement of <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194"></a>[194]</span>one who shone full bright; i.&nbsp;e. a fair
  lady, of course. But Sir Thopas, in dropping this mysterious hint to his
  merry men, refrains from saying much about it, as he had not yet seen the
  Fairy Queen, and had only the giant's word for her place of abode. The
  use of the past tense <i>shone</i> is artful; it implies that he wished
  them to think that he <i>had</i> seen his lady-love; or else that her
  beauty was to be taken for granted. Observe, too, that it is <i>Sir
  Thopas</i>, not <i>Chaucer</i>, who assigns to the giant his <i>three</i>
  heads.</p>

  <p>2035. <i>Do come</i>, cause to come; go and call hither. Cf. House of
  Fame, l. 1197:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt's note on <i>gestours</i> is&mdash;'The proper business of a
  <i>gestour</i> was to <i>recite tales</i>, or <i>gestes</i>; which was
  only <i>one</i> of the branches of the Minstrel's profession.
  <i>Minstrels</i> and <i>gestours</i> are mentioned together in the

  treatise by John of Waldby; MS. Reg. 17 C. viii. p. 2:&mdash;</p>

  </div>

  <p>I cite these lines to shew the species of tales related by the ancient
  Gestours, and how much they differed from what we now call
  <i>jests</i>.'</p>

  <p>The word <i>geste</i> here means a tale of the adventures of some
  hero, like those in the <i>Chansons de geste</i>. Cf. note to l. 2123
  below. Sometimes the plural <i>gestes</i> signifies passages of history.
  The famous collection called the Gesta Romanorum contains narratives of
  very various kinds.</p>

  <p>2038. <i>royales</i>, royal; some MSS. spell the word <i>reales</i>,
  but the meaning is the same. In the romance of Ywain and Gawain (Ritson,
  vol. i.) a maiden is described as reading 'a <i>real</i> romance.'
  Tyrwhitt thinks that the term originated with an Italian collection of
  romances relating to Charlemagne, which began with the words&mdash;'Qui
  se comenza la hystoria el <i>Real di Franza</i>,' &amp;c.; edit. Mutinae,
  1491, folio. It was reprinted in 1537, with a title beginning&mdash;'<i>I
  reali di Franza</i>,' &amp;c. He refers to Quadrío, t. vi. p. 530. The
  word <i>roial</i> (in some MSS. <i>real</i>) <!-- Page 195 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>[195]</span>occurs again in l.
  2043. Kölbing remarks that the prose romance of Generides is called <i>a
  royal historie</i>, though it has nothing to do with Charlemagne.</p>

  <p>2043. No comma is required at the end of this line; the articles
  mentioned in ll. 2044-6 all belong to <i>spicery</i>. Cf. additional note
  to Troilus, vol. ii. p. 506.</p>

  <p>2047. <i>dide</i>, did on, put on. The arming of Lybeaus Disconus is
  thus described in Ritson's Met. Rom. ii. 10:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Glossary to the Percy Folio MS., ed. Hales and Furnivall,

  jackett of plate for the warre, couered withe anye other stuffe; at this
  day also called <i>a jackett of plate</i>.'</p>

  <p>It is certain that the plates were a later addition. It is the mod. F.
  <i>hoqueton</i>, O. F. <i>auqueton</i>; and it is certain that the
  derivation is from Arab. <i>al-qoton</i> or <i>al-qutun</i>, lit. 'the

  <i>auqueton</i> in Godefroy, <i>hoqueton</i> in Devic's Supp. to Littré,

  <p>2054. <i>Jewes werk</i>, Jew's work. Tyrwhitt imagined that <i>Jew</i>
  here means a magician, but there is not the least foundation for the
  idea. Mr. Jephson is equally at fault in connecting <i>Jew</i> with
  <i>jewel</i>, since the latter word is etymologically connected with
  <i>joy</i>. The phrase still remains unexplained. I suspect it means no
  more than wrought with rich or expensive work, such as Jews could best
  find the money for. It is notorious that they were the chief capitalists,
  and they must often have had to find money for paying armourers. Or,
  indeed, it may refer to damascened work; from the position of
  Damascus.</p>

  <p>2055. <i>plate.</i> Probably the hauberk had a breastplate on the
  front of it. But on the subject of armour, I must refer the reader to
  Godwin's English Archaeologist's Handbook, pp. 252-268; Planché's History
  of British Costume, and Sir S. R. Meyrick's Observations on Body-armour,
  in the Archaeologia, vol. xix. pp. 120-145.</p>

  <p>2056. The <i>cote-armour</i> was not for defence, but a mere surcoat
  on which the knight's armorial bearings were usually depicted, in order
  to identify him in the combat or 'debate.' Hence the modern
  <i>coat-of-arms</i>.</p>

  <p>2059. <i>reed</i>, red. In the Romances, <i>gold</i> is always called
  <i>red</i>, and silver <i>white</i>. Hence it was not unusual to liken
  gold to blood, and this explains why Shakespeare speaks of armour being
  <i>gilt</i> with blood (King John, ii. 1. 316), and makes Lady Macbeth
  talk of <i>gilding</i> the groom's faces with blood (Macbeth, ii. 2. 56).
  See also Coriol. v. 1. 63, 64; and the expression 'blood bitokeneth
  gold'; Cant. Tales, D. 581.</p>

  <p>2061. 'A carbuncle (Fr. <i>escarboucle</i>) was a common [armorial]
  bearing. See Guillim's Heraldry, p. 109.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt.</p>

  <p>2062. Sir Thopas is made to swear by ale and bread, in ridiculous
  imitation of the vows made by the swan, the heron, the pheasant, or the
  peacock, on solemn occasions.</p>

  <p>2065. <i>Iambeux</i>, armour worn in front of the shins, above the
  mail-armour that covered the legs; see Fairholt. He tells us that, in
  Roach Smith's Catalogue of London Antiquities, p. 132, is figured a pair
  of cuirbouilly jambeux, which are fastened by thongs. Spenser borrows the
  word, but spells it <i>giambeux</i>, F.&nbsp;Q. ii. 6. 29.</p>

  <p><i>quirboilly</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>cuir bouilli</i>, leather soaked in hot
  water to soften it that it might take any required shape, after which it
  was dried and became exceedingly stiff and hard. In Matthew Paris (anno
  1243) it is <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page197"></a>[197]</span>said of the Tartars&mdash;'De <i>coriis
  bullitis</i> sibi arma leuia quidem, sed tamen impenetrabilia
  coaptarunt.' In Marco Polo, ed. Yule, ii. 49, it is said of the men of
  Carajan, that they wear armour of boiled leather (French text, <i>armes
  cuiracés de cuir bouilli</i>). Froissart (v. iv. cap. 19) says the
  Saracens covered their targes with '<i>cuir bouilli</i> de Cappadoce, ou
  nul fer ne peut prendre n'attacher, si le cuir n'est trop échaufé.' When
  Bruce reviewed his troops on the morning of the battle of Bannockburn, he
  wore, according to Barbour, 'ane hat of <i>qwyrbolle</i>' on his
  'basnet,' and 'ane hye croune' above that. Some remarks on <i>cuir
  bouilli</i> will be found in Cutts, Scenes and Characters of the Middle
  Ages, p. 344.</p>

  <p>2068. <i>rewel-boon</i>, probably whale-ivory, or ivory made of
  whales' teeth. In the Turnament of Tottenham, as printed in Percy's
  reliques, we read that Tyb had 'a garland on her hed ful of <i>rounde</i>
  bonys,' where another copy has (says Halliwell, s.&nbsp;v. <i>ruel</i>) the
  reading&mdash;'fulle of <i>ruelle</i><span class="nw">-bones.'</span>
  Halliwell adds&mdash;'In the romaunce of Rembrun, p. 458, the coping of a
  wall is mentioned as made 'of fin <i>ruwal</i>, that schon swithe

      <p class="hg1">'mes ne ert d'or adubbee, ne d'autre metal,</p>
      <p>de peres preciuses, de ivoire ne <i>roal</i>';</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. but it was not adorned with gold nor other metal, nor with
  precious stones, nor ivory, nor <i>rewel</i>. Du Cange gives a Low Lat.
  form <i>rohanlum</i>, and an O. Fr. <i>rochal</i>, but tells us that the
  MS. readings are <i>rohallum</i> and <i>rohal</i>. The passage occurs in
  the Laws of Normandy about wreckage, and should run&mdash;'dux sibi
  retinet ... ebur, <i>rohallum</i>, lapides pretiosas'; or, in the French
  version, 'l'ivoire, et le <i>rohal</i>, et les pierres precieuses.'
  Ducange explains the word by 'rock-crystal,' but this is a pure guess,
  suggested by F. <i>roche</i>, a rock. It is clear that, when the word is
  spelt <i>rochal</i>, the <i>ch</i> denotes the same sound as the Ger.
  <i>ch</i>, a guttural resembling <i>h</i>, and not the F. <i>ch</i> at
  all. Collecting all the spellings, we find them to be, in French,
  <i>rohal</i>, <i>rochal</i>, <i>roal</i>; and, in English, <i>ruwal</i>,
  <i>rewel</i>, <i>ruel</i>, (<i>reuylle</i>, <i>ruelle</i>). The <i>h</i>
  and <i>w</i> might arise from a Teutonic <i>hw</i>, so that the latter
  part of the word was originally <span class="nw">-</span><i>hwal</i>,
  i.&nbsp;e. whale; hence, perhaps, Godefroy explains F. <i>rochal</i> as
  'ivoire de morse,' ivory of the walrus (A. S. <i>hors-hwæl</i>). The <!--
  Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>[198]</span>true
  origin seems rather to be some Norse form akin to Norweg. <i>röyrkval</i>
  (E. <i>rorqual</i>). Some whales, as the <i>cachalot</i>, have teeth that
  afford a kind of ivory; and this is what seems to be alluded to. The
  expression 'white as <i>whale-bone</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. white as whale-ivory, was
  once common; see Weber's Met. Romances, iii. 350; and <i>whales-bone</i>
  in Nares. Most of this ivory was derived, however, from the tusk of the
  walrus or the narwhal. Sir Thopas's saddle was ornamented with ivory.</p>

  <p>2071. <i>cipress</i>, cypress-wood. In the Assembly of Foules, l. 179,
  we have&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'The sailing firr, the <i>cipres</i>, deth to pleyne'&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. the cypress suitable for lamenting a death. Vergil calls the
  cypress 'atra,' Æn. iii. 64, and 'feralis,' vi. 216; and as it is so
  frequently a symbol of mourning, it may be said to <i>bode war</i>.</p>

  <p>2078. In Sir Degrevant (ed. Halliwell, p. 191) we have just this
  expression&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg1">'Here endyth the furst fit.</p>
      <p>Howe say ye? will ye any more of hit?'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>2085. <i>love-drury</i>, courtship. All the six MSS. have this
  reading. According to Wright, the Harl. MS. has 'Of ladys loue and
  drewery,' which Tyrwhitt adopts; but it turns out that Wright's reading
  is <i>copied from Tyrwhitt</i>; the MS. really has&mdash;'And of ladys
  loue drewery,' like the rest.</p>

  <p>2088. The romance or lay of Horn appears in two forms in English. In
  King Horn, ed. Lumby, Early Eng. Text Soc., 1866, printed also in
  Mätzner's Altenglische Sprachproben, i. 207, the form of the poem is in
  short rimed couplets. But Chaucer no doubt refers to the other form with
  the title <i>Horn Childe</i> and Maiden Rimnild, <i>in a metre similar to
  Sir Thopas</i>, printed in Ritson's Metrical Romances, iii. 282. The
  Norman-French text was printed by F. Michel for the Bannatyne Club, with
  the English versions, in a volume entitled&mdash;Horn et Riemenhild;
  Recueil de ce qui reste des poëmes relatifs à leurs aventures, &amp;c.
  Paris, 1845. See Mr. Lumby's preface and the remarks in Mätzner.</p>

  <p>It is not quite clear why Chaucer should mention the romance of Sir
  Ypotis here, as it has little in common with the rest. There are four MS.
  copies of it in the British Museum, and three at Oxford. 'It professes to
  be a tale of holy writ, and the work of St. John the Evangelist. The
  scene is Rome. A child, named Ypotis, appears before the Emperor Adrian,
  saying that he is come to teach men God's law; whereupon the Emperor
  proceeds to interrogate him as to what is God's Law, and then of many
  other matters, not in any captious spirit, but with the utmost reverence
  and faith.... There is a little tract in prose on the same legend from
  the press of Wynkyn de Worde'; J. W. Hales, in Hazlitt's edition of
  Warton's Hist. of Eng. Poetry, ii. 183. It was printed in 1881, from the
  Vernon MS. at Oxford, in Horstmann's Altenglische Legenden, Neue Folge,
  pp. 341-8. It is hard to believe that, by Ypotys, Chaucer meant (as some
  say) Ypomadoun. <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page199"></a>[199]</span></p>

  <p>The romance of Sir Bevis of Hampton (i.&nbsp;e. Southampton) was printed
  from the Auchinleck MS. for the Maitland Club in 1838, 4to. Another copy
  is in MS. Ff. 2. 38, in the Cambridge University Library. It has lately
  been edited, from six MS. copies and an old printed text, by Prof.
  Kölbing, for the Early Eng. Text Society. There is an allusion in it to
  the <i>Romans</i>, meaning the French original. It appears in prose also,
  in various forms. See Warton's Hist. of Eng. Poetry, ed. Hazlitt, ii.
  142, where there is also an account of Sir Guy, in several forms; but a
  still fuller account of Sir Guy is given in the Percy Folio MS., ed.
  Hales and Furnivall, ii. 509. This Folio MS. itself contains three poems
  on the latter subject, viz. Guy and Amarant, Guy and Colbrande, and Guy
  and Phillis. 'Sir Guy of Warwick' has been edited for the Early Eng. Text
  Society by Prof. Zupitza.</p>

  <p>By <i>Libeux</i> is meant Lybeaus Disconus, printed by Ritson in his
  Metrical Romances, vol. ii. from the Cotton MS. Caligula A. 2. A later
  copy, with the title Libius Disconius, is in the Percy Folio MS. ii. 404,
  where a good account of the romance may be found. The best edition is
  that by Dr. Max Kulaza, entitled Libeaus Desconus; Leipzig, 1890. The
  French original was discovered in 1855, in a MS. belonging to the Duc
  d'Aumale. Its title is Li Biaus Desconneus, which signifies The Fair
  Unknown.</p>

  <p><i>Pleyndamour</i> evidently means <i>plein d'amour</i>, full of love,
  and we may suspect that the original romance was in French; but there is
  now no trace of any romance of that name, though a Sir Playne de Amours
  is mentioned in Sir T. Malory's Morte Darthur, bk. ix. c. 7. Spenser
  probably borrowed hence his <i>Sir Blandamour</i>, F. Q. iv. 1. 32.</p>

  <p>2092. After examining carefully the rimes in Chaucer's Canterbury
  Tales, Mr. Bradshaw finds that this is the <i>sole</i> instance in which
  a word which ought etymologically to end in <span
  class="nw">-</span><i>yë</i> is rimed with a word ending in <span
  class="nw">-</span><i>y</i> without a following final <i>e</i>. A reason
  for the exception is easily found; for Chaucer has here adopted the swing
  of the ballad metre, and hence ventures to deprive <i>chiualryë</i> of
  its final <i>e</i>, and to call it <i>chivalry'</i> so that it may rime
  with <i>Gy</i>, after the manner of the ballad-writers; cf. Squyre of
  Lowe Degre, 79, 80. So again <i>chivalryë</i>, <i>druryë</i> become
  <i>chivalry</i>, <i>drury</i>; ll. 2084, 2085. We even find <i>plas</i>
  for <i>plac-e</i>, 1971; and <i>gras</i> for <i>grac-e</i>, 2021.</p>

  <p>2094. <i>glood</i>, glided. So in all the MSS. except E., which has
  the poor reading <i>rood</i>, rode. For the expression in l. 2095,
  compare&mdash;</p>

  <p>2106. The first few lines of the romance of Sir Perceval of Galles
  (ed. Halliwell, p. 1) will at once explain Chaucer's allusion. It

    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Both Sir Thopas and Sir Perceval were water-drinkers, but it did not
  impair their vigour.</p>

  <p>In the same romance, p. 84, we find&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Of mete ne drynke he ne roghte,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These quotations set aside Mr. Jephson's interpretation, and solve
  Tyrwhitt's difficulty. Tyrwhitt says that 'The Romance of Perceval le
  Galois, or de Galis, was composed in octosyllable French verse by
  Chrestien de Troyes, one of the oldest and best French romancers, before
  the year 1191; Fauchet, l. ii. c. x. It consisted of above 60,000 verses
  (Bibl. des Rom. t. ii. p. 250) so that it would be some trouble to find
  the fact which is, probably, here alluded to. The romance, under the same
  title, in French prose, printed at Paris, 1530, fol., can be an
  abridgement, I suppose, of the original poem.'</p>

  <p>2107. <i>worthy under wede</i>, well-looking in his armour. The phrase
  is very common. Tyrwhitt says it occurs repeatedly in the romance of
  Emare, and refers to folios 70, 71 b, 73 a, and 74 b of the MS.; but the
  reader may now find the romance in print; see Ritson's Metrical Romances,
  ii. pp. 214, 229, 235, 245. The phrase is used of ladies also, and must
  then mean of handsome appearance when well-dressed. See Amis and Amiloun,
  ed. Weber, ii. pp. 370, 375. Cf. l. 1979.</p>

  <p>2108. The story is here broken off by the host's interruption. MSS.

<p class="ac"><b>The Tale of Melibeus.</b></p>

  <p>For the sources of the Tale of Melibeus, see vol. iii. p. 426. It may
  suffice to say here that Chaucer's Tale is translated from the French
  version entitled <i>Le Livre de Mellibee et Prudence</i>, ascribed by M.
  Paul Meyer to Jean de Meung. Of this text there are two MS. copies in the
  British Museum, viz. MS. Reg. 19 C. vii. and MS. Reg. 19 C. xi, both of
  the fifteenth century; the former is said by Mr. T. Wright to be the more
  correct. It is also printed, as forming part of <i>Le Menagier de
  Paris</i>, the author of which embodied it in his book, written about
  1393; the title of the printed book being&mdash;'Le Menagier de Paris;
  publié pour la première fois par la Société des Bibliophiles François; a
  Paris M.D. CCC. XLVI'; (tome i. p. 186); ed. J. Pichon. In the following
  notes, this is alluded to as <i>the French text</i>.</p>

  <p>This French version was, in its turn, translated from the <i>Liber
  Consolationis et Consilii</i> of Albertano of Brescia, excellently edited
  for the Chaucer Society in 1873 by Thor Sundby, with the title 'Albertani
  Brixiensis Liber Consolationis et Consilii.' This is alluded to, in the
  following notes, as <i>the Latin text</i>. Thor Sundby's edition is most
  helpful, as the editor has taken great pains to trace the sources of the
  <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page202"></a>[202]</span>very numerous quotations with which the
  Tale abounds; and I am thus enabled to give the references in most cases.
  I warn the reader that Albertano's quotations are frequently
  <i>inexact</i>.</p>

  <p>Besides this, the Tale of Melibeus has been admirably edited, as a
  specimen of English prose, in Mätzner's Altenglische Sprachproben, ii.
  375, with numerous notes, of which I here make considerable use. Owing to
  the great care taken by Sundby and Mätzner, the task of explaining the
  difficulties in this Tale has been made easy. The more important notes
  from Mätzner are marked 'Mr.'</p>

  <p>The first line or clause (numbered 2157) ends with the word 'Sophie,'
  as shewn by the slanting stroke. The whole Tale is thus divided into
  clauses, for the purpose of ready reference, precisely as in the Six-text
  edition; I refer to these <i>clauses</i> as if they were <i>lines</i>.
  The 'paragraphs' are the same as in Tyrwhitt's edition.</p>

  <p>2157. <i>Melibeus.</i> The meaning of the name is given below (note to
  l. 2600).</p>

  <p><i>Prudence.</i> 'It is from a passage of Cassiodorus, quoted by
  Albertano in cap. vi., that he [Albertano] has taken the name of his
  heroine, if we may call her so, and the general idea of her
  character:&mdash;"Superauit cuncta infatigabilis et expedita

  Tyrwhitt has <i>foure</i>, as in MSS. Cp. Ln.; yet in l. 2562, he prints
  'thin enemies ben three,' and in l. 2615, he again prints 'thy three
  enemies.' Again, in l. 2612, it is explained that these three enemies
  signify, allegorically, the flesh, the world, and the devil.</p>

  <p>2164. <i>As ferforth</i>, as far; as in B. 19, 1099, &amp;c. Mätzner
  also quotes from Troilus, ii. 1106&mdash;'How ferforth be ye put in loves
  daunce.'</p>

  <p>2172. <i>Warisshe</i>, recover; Cp. Ln. Hl. <i>be warisshed</i>, be
  cured. Chaucer uses this verb elsewhere both transitively and
  intransitively, so that either reading will serve. For the transitive
  use, see below, ll. 2207, 2466, 2476, 2480; also F. 856, 1138, 1162; Book
  of Duch. 1104. For the intransitive use, observe that, in F. 856, Cp. Pt.

  peynes <!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  neuer!'&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>Lat. text&mdash;'Filia tua, dante Domino, bene liberabitur.'</p>

  <p>2174. <i>Senek</i>, Seneca. 'Non affligitur sapiens liberorum
  amissione, non amicorum; eodem animo enim fert illorum mortem quo suam
  expectat'; Epist. 74, § 29.</p>

  <p>2177. <i>Lazarus</i>; see John, xi. 35.</p>

  <p>2178. <i>Attempree</i>, moderate; Lat. text, 'temperatus fletus.' Hl.
  <i>attemperel</i>, which Mätzner illustrates. Cf. D. 2053, where Hl. has
  <i>attemperelly</i>; and E. 1679, where Hl. has <i>attemperely</i>. Cf.
  ll. 2570, 2728 below.</p>

  <p><i>Nothing defended</i>, not at all forbidden.</p>

  <p>2179. See Rom. xii. 15.</p>

  <p>2181. 'According to the doctrine that Seneca teaches us.' Cf. 'Non
  sicci sint oculi, amisso amico, nec fluant; lacrimandum est, non
  plorandum'; Epist. 63, § 1.</p>

  <p>2183. This is also, practically, from Seneca: 'Quem amabis extulisti,
  quaere quem ames; satius est amicum reparare, quam flere'; Epist. 63, §
  9.</p>

  <p>2185. <i>Iesus Syrak</i>, Jesus the son of Sirach. 'Ecclesiasticus is
  the title given in the Latin version to the book which is called in the
  Septuagint The Wisdom of Jesus the son of Sirach'; Smith, Dict. of the
  Bible. Compare the title 'A prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach' to Ecclus.
  ch. li. But the present quotation is really from Prov. xvii. 22. It is
  the <i>next</i> quotation, in l. 2186, that is from Ecclus. xxx. 25
  (Vulgate), i.&nbsp;e. xxx. 23 in the English version. The mistake is due to
  misreading the original Lat. text, which quotes the passages <i>in the
  reverse order</i>, as being from 'Jesus Sirac' and 'alibi.'</p>

  <p>2187. From Prov. xxv. 20; but the clause is omitted in the modern Eng.
  version, though Wycliffe has it. The Vulgate has:&mdash;'Sicut tinea
  uestimento, et uermis ligno: ita tristitia uiri nocet cordi.' The words
  <i>in the shepes flees</i> (in the sheep's fleece) are added by Chaucer,
  apparently by way of explanation. But the fact is that, according to
  Mätzner, the Fr. version here has 'la tigne, ou lartuison, nuit a la
  robe,' where <i>artuison</i> is the Mod. F. <i>artison</i>, explained by
  Cotgrave as 'a kind of moth'; and I strongly suspect that 'in the shepes
  flees' is due to this 'ou lartuison,' which Chaucer may have misread as
  <i>en la toison</i>. It looks very like it. I point other similar
  mistakes further on.</p>

  <p><i>Anoyeth</i>, harms; F. <i>nuit</i>, L. <i>nocet</i>. The use of
  <i>to</i> here is well illustrated by Mätzner, who compares Wycliffe's
  version of this very passage; 'As a moghe to the cloth, and a werm to the
  tree, so sorewe of a man <i>noyeth to</i> the herte'; whereas Purvey's
  later version thrice omits the <i>to</i>. In the Persones Tale, Group I.
  847, <i>anoyeth</i> occurs both with <i>to</i> and without it.</p>

  <p>2188. <i>Us oghte</i>, it would become us; <i>oghte</i> is in the
  subjunctive mood. Cf. <i>hem oughte</i>, it became them, in l. 2458;
  <i>thee oughte</i>, it became thee, in l. 2603.&mdash;Mr. The pres.
  indic. form is <i>us oweth</i>. <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page204"></a>[204]</span></p>

  <p><i>Goodes temporels</i>; F. text, <i>biens temporels</i>. Chaucer uses
  the F. pl. in <i><span class="nw">-es</span></i> or <i><span
  class="nw">-s</span></i> for the adjective in other places, and the adj.
  then usually follows the sb. Cf. <i>lettres capitals</i>, capital
  letters, Astrolabe, i. 16. 8; <i>weyes espirituels</i>, spiritual ways,
  Pers. Tale, I. 79; <i>goodes espirituels</i>, id. 312; <i>goodes
  temporeles</i>, id. 685; <i>thinges espirituels</i>, id.
  784.&mdash;Mr.</p>

  <p>2190. See Job, i. 21. <i>Hath wold</i>, hath willed (it); see
  2615.</p>

  <p>2193. Quotations from Solomon and from Ecclesiasticus are frequently
  confused, both throughout this Tale, and elsewhere. The reference is to
  Ecclus. xxxii. 24, in the Vulgate (cf. A.&nbsp;V. xxxii. 19); here Wycliffe
  has:&mdash;'Sone, withoute counseil no-thing do thou; and after thi deede
  thou shalt not othynke' (i.&nbsp;e. <i>of-thinke</i>, repent).</p>

  <p><i>Thou shalt never repente</i>; here Hl. has&mdash;'the thar neuer
  rewe,' i.&nbsp;e. it needeth never for thee to rue it.</p>

  <p>2202. <i>With-holde</i>, retained. Cf. A. 511; Havelok,
  2362.&mdash;Mr.</p>

  <p>2204. <i>Parties</i>, &amp;c.; Fr. text: <i>supporter
  partie</i>.&mdash;Mr.</p>

  <p>2205. <i>Hool and sound</i>; a common phrase. Cf. Rob. of Glouc. pp.
  163, 402, ed. Hearne (ll. 3417, 8301, ed. Wright); King Horn, l. 1365 (in
  Morris's Specimens of English); also l. 2300 below.&mdash;Mr.</p>

  <p>2207. 'Heal, put a stop to, war by taking vengeance; a literal and
  very happy translation from the French&mdash;<i>aussi doit on guerir
  guerre par vengence</i>.'&mdash;Bell. Tyrwhitt omits the words <i>by
  vengeaunce</i>, and Lounsbury (Studies in Chaucer, i. 320) defends him,
  arguing that 'the physicians are represented as agreeing with the
  surgeons'; whereas Chaucer expressly says that 'they seyden a fewe wordes
  more.' The words 'by vengeaunce' are in all the seven MSS. and in the
  French original. Admittedly, they make nonsense, but the nonsense is
  expressly laid bare and exposed afterwards, when it appears that the
  physicians did <i>not really</i> add this clause, but Melibeus dreamt
  that they did (2465-2480). The fact is, however, that the words <i>par
  vengence</i> were wrongly interpolated in the French text. Chaucer
  <i>should</i> have omitted them, but the evidence shews that he <i>did
  not</i>. I decline to falsify the text in order to set the author right.
  We should then have to set the French text right also!</p>

  <p>2209. 'Made this matter much worse, and aggravated it.'</p>

  <p>2210. <i>Outrely</i>, utterly, entirely, i.&nbsp;e. without reserve; Fr.
  text <i>tout oultre</i>. Not from A.&nbsp;S. <i>&#x16B;tor</i>, outer, utter,
  but from F. <i>oultre</i>, <i>outre</i>, moreover; of which one sense, in
  Godefroy, is 'excessivement.' See E. 335, 639, 768, 953; C. 849;
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>2216. Fr. text&mdash;'en telle maniere que tu soies bien pourveu
  d'espies et guettes.'&mdash;Mr.</p>

  <p>2218. <i>To moeve</i>; Fr. text, <i>de mouvoir guerre</i>; cf. the
  Lat. phrase <i>mouere bellum</i>.&mdash;Mr.</p>

  <p>2220. The Lat. text has here <i>three</i> phrases for Chaucer's
  'common proverb.' It has: 'non enim subito uel celeriter est iudicandum,
  "omnia enim subita probantur incauta," et "in iudicando criminosa est
  celeritas," et "ad poenitendum properat qui cito iudicat."' Of these, the
  first is from Cassiodorus, Variarum lib. i. c. 17; and the second and
  <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>[205]</span>third from Publilius Syrus, Sententiae,
  254 and 32 (ed. Friedrich, Berolini, 1880). For <i>iudicando</i>, as in
  some MSS., Friedrich has the variant <i>vindicando</i>. Cf. the Proverbs
  of Hending, l. 256: 'Ofte rap reweth,' haste often rues. See note to
  2244.</p>

  <p>2221. <i>Men seyn</i>; this does not necessarily mean that Chaucer is
  referring to a proverb. He is merely translating. The Lat. text has;
  'quare <i>dici consueuit</i>, Optimum iudicem existimem, qui cito
  intelligit et tarde iudicat.' It also quotes two sentences (nos. 311 and
  128) from Publilius Syrus: 'Mora omnis odio est, sed facit sapientiam';
  and&mdash;'Deliberare utilia mora est tutissima.' Mätzner points out that
  there are two other sentences (nos. 659 and 32) in Publilius, which come
  very near the expression in the text, viz. 'Velox consilium sequitur
  poenitentia'; and&mdash;'Ad poenitendum properat, qui cito iudicat.'</p>

  <p>2223. See John, viii. 3-8. For <i>he wroot</i>, Hl. has 'he<i>m</i>
  wrot,' which is obviously wrong.</p>

  <p>2227. <i>Made contenaunce</i>, made a sign, made a gesture. Among the
  senses of F. <i>contenance</i>, Cotgrave gives: 'gesture, posture,
  behaviour, carriage.'</p>

  <p>2228. Fr. text&mdash;'qui ne scevent que guerre se
  monte.'&mdash;Mr.</p>

  <p>2229. 'The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water';
  Prov. xvii. 14.</p>

  <p>2231. 'The chylde may rue that is vnborn'; Chevy Chase, l. 9.</p>

  <p>2235. 'A tale out of season is as music in mourning'; Ecclus. xxii.
  6.</p>

  <p>2237. Not from 'Solomon,' but from 'Jesus, son of Sirach,' as before.
  The Lat. text agrees with the Vulgate version of Ecclus. xxxii. 6: 'ubi
  auditus non est, ne effundas sermonem'; the E. version (verse 4) is
  somewhat different, viz. 'Pour not out words where there is a musician,
  and shew not forth wisdom out of time.' Chaucer gives us the same saying
  again <i>in verse</i>; see B. 3991.</p>

  <p>2238. Lat. text: 'semper consilium tunc deest, quando maxime opus
  est'; from Publilius Syrus, Sent. 594. (<i>Read</i> cum opus est
  maxime.)</p>

  <p>2242. Cf. F. text&mdash;'Sire, dist elle, je vous prie que vous ne
  vous hastez, et que vous pour tous dons me donnez
  espace.'&mdash;Wright.</p>

  <p>2243. <i>Piers Alfonce</i>, Petrus Alfonsi. 'Peter Alfonsus, or
  Alfonsi, was a converted Spanish Jew, who flourished in the twelfth
  century, and is well known for his <i>Disciplina Clericalis</i>, a
  collection of stories and moralisations in Latin prose, which was
  translated afterwards into French verse, under the title of the
  <i>Chastoiement d'un pere a son fils</i>. It was a book much in vogue
  among the preachers from the thirteenth to the fifteenth
  century.'&mdash;Wright. Tyrwhitt has a long note here; he says that a
  copy of this work is in MS. Bibl. Reg. 10 B. xii in the British Museum,
  and that there is also a copy of another work by the same author,
  entitled <i>Dialogus contra Judaeos</i>, in MS. Harl. 3861. He also
  remarks that the manner and style of the <i>Disciplina Clericalis</i>
  'show many marks of an Eastern original; and one of his stories <i>Of a
  trick put upon a thief</i> is entirely taken from the Calilah a Damnah, a
  celebrated collection of Oriental apologues.' All the best fables of
  Alfonsus <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>[206]</span>were afterwards incorporated (says
  Tyrwhitt) into the Gesta Romanorum. He was born at Huesca, in Arragon, in
  1062, and converted to Christianity in 1106.</p>

  <p>The words here referred to are the following: 'Ne properes ulli
  reddere mutuum boni uel mali, quia diutius expectabit te amicus, et
  diutius timebit te inimicus'; Disc. Cler. xxv. 15; ed. F. W. V. Schmidt,
  Berlin, 1827, 4to., p. 71.</p>

  <p>2244. <i>The proverbe</i>, &amp;c.; not in either the Latin or the
  French texts. Cf. the proverb of Hending&mdash;'ofte rap reweth,' often
  haste rues it. Heywood has&mdash;'The more haste, the worse speed'; on
  which Ray notes&mdash;'Come s'ha fretta non si fa mai niente che stia
  bene'; <i>Ital.</i> Qui trop se hâte en cheminant, en beau chemin se
  fourvoye souvent; <i>Fr.</i> Qui nimis properè minus prosperè; et nimium
  properans serius absoluit.</p>

  <p>'Tarry a little, that we may make an end the sooner, was a saying of
  Sir Amias Paulet. Presto e bene non si conviene; <i>Ital.</i>' See 2325
  below, and observe that Chaucer has <i>the same form of words</i> in
  Troil. i. 956.</p>

  <p>2247. From Ecclesiastes, vii. 28. Cf. A. 3154.</p>

  <p>2249. From Ecclus. xxv. 30 (Vulgate): 'Mulier, si primatum habeat,
  contraria est uiro suo.' Not in the A.&nbsp;V.; cf. v. 22 of that version.</p>

  <p>2250. From Ecclus. xxxiii. 20-22 (Vulgate); 19-21 (A. V.).</p>

  <p>2251. After <i>noght be</i>, ed. 1550 adds&mdash;'if I shuld be
  cou<i>n</i>sayled by the'; but this is redundant. See next note.</p>

  <p>2252-3. These clauses are omitted in the MSS. and black-letter
  editions, but are absolutely necessary to the sense. The French text
  has&mdash;'car il est escript: la jenglerie des femmes ne puet riens
  celer fors ce qu'elle ne scet. Apres, le philosophe dit: en mauvais
  conseil les femmes vainquent les hommes. Pour ces raisons, je ne doy
  point user de ton conseil.' It is easy to turn this into Chaucerian
  English, by referring to ll. 2274, 2280 below, where the missing passage
  is quoted with but slight alteration.</p>

  <p>The former clause is quoted from Marcus Annaeus Seneca, father of
  Seneca the philosopher, Controversiarum Lib. ii. 13.
  12:&mdash;'Garrulitas mulierum id solum nouit celare, quod nescit.' Cf.
  P. Plowman, B. v. 168; xix. 157; and see the Wyf of Bathes Tale, D. 950.
  The second clause is from Publilius Syrus, Sent. 324:&mdash;'Malo in
  consilio feminae uincunt uiros.'</p>

  <p>2257. 'Non est turpe cum re mutare consilium'; Seneca, De Beneficiis,
  iv. 38, § 1.</p>

  <p><i>Maketh no lesing</i>, telleth no lie; compare the use of
  <i>lyer</i> just above.</p>

  <p><i>Turneth his corage</i>, changes his mind. Mätzner quotes a similar
  phrase from Halliwell's Dict., s.&nbsp;v. <i>Torne</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'But thogh a man himself be good,</p>
      <p>And he <i>torne</i> so <i>his mood</i></p>
      <p>That he haunte fooles companye,</p>
      <p>It shal him torne to grete folie.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>MS. Lansdowne 793, fol. 68. <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>[207]</span></p>

  <p>2258. <i>Thar ye nat</i>, it needs not that ye; i.&nbsp;e. you are not
  obliged. <i>But yow lyke</i>, unless you please (lit. unless it please
  you).</p>

  <p>2259. <i>Ther</i>, where. <i>What that him lyketh</i>, whatever he
  likes.</p>

  <p>2260. <i>Save your grace</i>, with the same sense as the commoner
  phrase 'save your reverence.' The Lat. text has 'salua reuerentia tua';
  which shews the original form of the phrase.</p>

  <p><i>As seith the book.</i> Here 'the book' probably means no more than
  the Latin text, which has 'nam qui omnes despicit, omnibus displicet';
  without any reference.</p>

  <p>2261. <i>Senek.</i> Mätzner says this is not to be found in Seneca; in
  fact, the Latin text refers us to 'Seneca, De Formula Honestae Vitae';
  but Sundby has found it in Martinus Dumiensis, Formula Honestae Vitae,
  cap. iii. This shews that it was attributed to Seneca erroneously.
  Moreover, the original is more fully expressed, and runs
  thus&mdash;'Nullius imprudentiam despicias; rari sermonis ipse, sed
  loquentium patiens auditor; seuerus non saeuus, hilares neque aspernans;
  sapientiae cupidus et docilis; quae scieris, sine arrogantia postulanti
  imperties; quae nescieris, sine occultatione ignorantiae tibi benigne
  postula impertiri.' Cf. Horace, Epist. vi. 67, 68.</p>

  <p>2265. <i>Rather</i>, sooner. See Mark, xvi. 9. The weakness of this
  argument for the <i>goodness</i> of woman appears by comparison with P.
  Plowman, C. viii. 138: 'A synful Marye the seyh er seynt Marie thy
  moder,' i.&nbsp;e. Christ was seen by St. Mary the sinner earlier than by St.
  Mary His mother, after His resurrection.</p>

  <p>2266-9. This reappears in verse in the March. Tale, E. 2277-2290.</p>

  <p>2269. Alluding to Matt. xix. 17; Luke xviii. 19.</p>

  <p>2273. <i>Or noon</i>, or not. So elsewhere; see B. 2407, F. 778, I.
  962, 963, 964.</p>

  <p>2276. Cf. P. Plowman, C. xx. 297, on which my note is as follows.
  'Perhaps the original form of this commonly quoted proverb is
  this:&mdash;"Tria sunt enim quae non sinunt hominem in domo permanere;
  fumus, stillicidium, et mala uxor"; Innocens Papa, de Contemptu Mundi, i.
  18. It is a mere compilation from Prov. x. 26, xix. 13, and xxvii. 15.
  Chaucer refers to it in his Tale of Melibeus, Prologue to Wife of Bathes
  Tale (D. 278), and Persones Tale (I. 631); see also Kemble's Solomon and
  Saturn, pp. 43, 53, 63; Walter Mapes, ed. Wright, p. 83.' Cf. Wright's
  Bibliographia Britannica, Anglo-Norman Period, pp. 333, 334; Hazlitt's
  Proverbs, pp. 114, 339; Ida von Düringsfeld, Sprichwörter, vol. i. sect.
  303; Peter Cantor, ed. Migne, col. 331; &amp;c. A medieval proverbial
  line expresses the same thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>2308. From Tobit, iv. 20 (Vulgate); iv. 19 (A. V.). <i>Dresse</i>,
  direct; Lat. 'ut uias tuas <i>dirigat</i>.'</p>

  <p>2309. From James, i. 5. At this point the Fr. text is much shortened,
  pp. 20-30 of the Latin text being omitted.</p>

  <p>2311. Lat. text (p. 33):&mdash;'a te atque consiliariis tuis remoueas
  illa tria, quae maxime sunt consilio contraria, scilicet iram, uoluptatem
  siue cupiditatem atque festinantiam.'</p>

  <p>2315. Lat. text:&mdash;'iratus semper plus putat posse facere, quam
  possit.'</p>

  <p>2317. The Lat. text shews that the quotation is not from Seneca's De
  Ira, but from Publilius Syrus, Sent. 281:&mdash;'Iratus nil non criminis
  loquitur loco.' Cf. D. 2005, I. 537.</p>

  <p>2320. From 1 Tim. vi. 10. See C. 334, I. 739.</p>

  <p>2325. Lat. 'Ad poenitendum properat, qui cito iudicat'; from Publil.
  Syrus, Sent. 32. (<i>Read</i> cito qui.) See l. 2244 above, and the
  note.</p>

  <p>2331. From Ecclus. xix. 8, 9 (A. V.).</p>

  <p>2333. Lat. text (p. 40):&mdash;'Et alius dixit: Vix existimes ab uno
  posse celari secretum.' <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page209"></a>[209]</span></p>

  <p>2334. <i>The book.</i> Lat. text:&mdash;'Consilium absconditum quasi
  in carcere tuo est retrusum, reuelatum uero te in carcere suo tenet
  ligatum.' Compare Petrus Alfonsi, Disciplina Clericalis, iv. 3. Cf.
  Ecclus. viii. 22 (Vulgate); viii. 19 (A. V.).</p>

  <p>2337. Lat. text:&mdash;'Ait enim Seneca: Si tibi ipse non imperasti,
  ut taceres, quomodo ab alio silentium quaeris?' This, however, is not
  from Seneca, but from Martinus Dumiensis, De Moribus, Sent. 16. Sundby
  further quotes from Plutarch (Opera, ed. Hutten. Tubingae, 1814, vol.
  xiv. p. 395):&mdash;<span title="Hoper an siôpasthai boulêi, mêdeni eipêis; ê pôs para tinos apaitêseis to piston tês siôpês, ho mê paresches seautôi?" class="grk"

  <p>2338. <i>Plyt</i>, plight, condition. It rimes with <i>appetyt</i>, E.
  2336, and <i>wyte</i>, G. 953. It occurs again in the Complaint of
  Anelida, 297, and Parl. of Foules, 294; and in Troilus, ii. 712, 1738,
  iii. 1039. The modern spelling is wrong, as it is quite a different word
  from the verb to <i>plight</i>. See it discussed in my Etym. Dict.,
  Errata and Addenda, p. 822.</p>

  <p>2342. <i>Men seyn.</i> This does not appear to be a quotation, but a
  sort of proverb. The Lat. text merely says:&mdash;'Et <i>haec est
  ratio</i> quare magnates atque potentes, si per se nesciunt, consilium
  bonum uix aut nunquam capere possunt.'</p>

  <p>2348. From Prov. xxvii. 9.</p>

  <p>2349. From Ecclus. vi. 15:&mdash;'Amico fideli non est comparatio; et
  non est digna ponderatio auri et argenti contra bonitatem fidei illius.'
  L. 2350 is a sort of paraphrase of the latter clause.</p>

  <p>2351. From Ecclus. vi. 14:&mdash;'Amicus fidelis, protectio fortis;
  qui autem inuenit illum, inuenit thesaurum.' 'He [Socrates] was wonte to
  saie, that there is no possession or treasure more precious then a true
  and an assured good frende.'&mdash;N. Udall, tr. of Erasmus'
  Apophthegmes, Socrates, § 13.</p>

  <p>2352. Cf. Prov. xxii. 17; Ecclus. ix. 14.</p>

  <p>2354. Cf. Job xii. 12.</p>

  <p>2355. From Cicero, De Senectute, vi. 17:&mdash;'Non uiribus aut
  uelocitatibus aut celeritate corporum res magnae geruntur, sed consilio,
  auctoritate, sententia; quibus non modo non orbari, sed etiam augeri
  senectus solet.'</p>

  <p>2357. From Ecclus. vi. 6.</p>

  <p>2361. From Prov. xi. 14; cf. xv. 22.</p>

  <p>2363. From Ecclus. viii. 17.</p>

  <p>2364. Lat. text:&mdash;'Scriptum est enim, Proprium est stultitiae
  aliena uitia cernere, suorum autem obliuisci.' From Cicero, Disput. Tusc.
  iii. 30. 73.</p>

  <p>2366. 'Sic habendum est, nullam in amicitia pestem esse maiorem quam
  adulationem, blanditiam, assentationem'; Cicero, Laelius, xxvi. 97
  [<i>or</i> xxv.]</p>

  <p>2367. Lat. text:&mdash;'In consiliis itaque et in aliis rebus non
  acerba uerba, sed blanda timebis.' The last six words are from Martinus
  Dumiensis, De Quatuor Virtutibus Cardinalibus, cap. iii. Cf. Prov.
  xxviii. 23. <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page210"></a>[210]</span></p>

  <p>2368. From Prov. xxix. 5. The words in the next clause (2369) seem to
  be merely another rendering of the same passage.</p>

  <p>2370. 'Cauendum est, ne assentatoribus patefaciamus aures neue adulari
  nos sinamus'; Cicero, De Officiis, i. 26.</p>

  <p>2371. From Dionysius Cato, Distich. iii. 6:&mdash;'Sermones blandos
  blaesosque cauere memento.'</p>

  <p>2373. 'Cum inimico nemo in gratiam tuto [<i>al.</i> tute] redit';
  Publilius Syrus, Sent. 91.</p>

  <p>2374. Lat. text:&mdash;'Quare Ysopus dixit:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ne confidatis secreta nec his detegatis,</p>
      <p>Cum quibus egistis pugnae discrimina tristis.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>2375. Not from Seneca, but from Publilius Syrus, Sent.
  389:&mdash;'Nunquam ubi diu fuit ignis deficit uapor'; but the MSS.
  differ in their readings. 'There is no fire without some smoke';
  Heywood's Proverbs.</p>

  <p>2376. From Ecclus. xii. 10.</p>

  <p>2379. The passage alluded to is the following:&mdash;'Ne te
  associaueris cum inimicis tuis, cum alios possis repperire socios; quae
  enim mala egeris notabunt, quae uero bona fuerint deuitabunt [Lat. text,
  deuiabunt]'; cf. Petrus Alfonsi, Disciplina Clericalis, iv. 4. The words
  'they wol perverten it' seem to be due to the reading <i>deuiabunt</i>,
  taken to mean 'they will turn aside,' in a transitive sense.</p>

  <p>2381. Lat. text (pp. 50, 51); 'ut quidam philosophus dixit, Nemo ei
  satis fidus est, quem metuit.'</p>

  <p>2382. Inexactly quoted from the Latin text, taken from Cicero, De
  Officiis, ii. 7:&mdash;'Malus custos diuturnitatis est metus, contraque
  beniuolentia fidelis uel ad perpetuitatem.... Nulla uis imperii tanta
  est, quae premente metu possit esse diuturna.'</p>

  <p>2384. From Prov. xxxi. 4, where the Vulgate has: 'Noli regibus, o
  Lamuel, noli regibus dare uinum; quia nullum secretum est ubi regnat
  ebrietas.' Cf. C. 561 (and note), 585, 587.</p>

  <p>2386. <i>Cassidorie</i>, Cassiodorus, who wrote in the time of
  Theoderic the Great, king of the Ostrogoths (<span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  475-526). The quotation is from his Variarum lib. x. epist.
  18:&mdash;'quia laesionis instar est occulte consulere, et aliud uelle
  monstrare.' In the Latin text, cap. xxiii, the heading of the chapter
  is:&mdash;'De Vitando consilium illorum, qui secreto aliud consulunt, et
  palam aliud se uelle ostendunt.' Chaucer's rendering is far from being a
  happy one.</p>

  <p>2387. Cf. Prov. xii. 5; but note that the Lat. text has:&mdash;'Malus
  homo a se nunquam bonum consilium refert'; which resembles Publilius
  Syrus, Sent. 354:&mdash;'Malus bonum ad se nunquam consilium refert.'</p>

  <p>2388. From Ps. i. 1.</p>

  <p>2391. <i>Tullius.</i> The reference is to Cicero's De Officiis, ii. 5,
  as quoted in the 'Latin text':&mdash;'quid in unaquaque re uerum
  sincerumque sit, quid consentaneum cuique rei sit, quid consequens, ex
  quibus <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page211"></a>[211]</span>quaeque gignantur, quae cuiusque rei
  caussa sit.' This is expanded in the English, down to l. 2400.</p>

  <p>2405. For <i>distreyneth</i>, MS. Hl. has the corrupt reading
  <i>destroyeth</i>. The reading is settled by the lines in Chaucer's
  Proverbs (see the Minor Poems, vol. i. p. 407):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Who-so mochel wol embrace</p>
      <p>Litel therof he shal <i>distreyne</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Lat. text has: 'Qui nimis capit parum stringit'; the Fr. text has:
  'Qui trop embrasse, pou estraint.'</p>

  <p>2406. <i>Catoun</i>, Dionysius Cato; Distich. iii. 15:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Quod potes, id tentato; operis ne pondere pressus</p>
      <p>Succumbat labor, et frustra tentata relinquas.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>2408. The Lat. text has:&mdash;'Ait enim Petrus Alfunsus, Si dicere
  metuas unde poeniteas, semper est melius <i>non</i> quam <i>sic</i>.'
  From his Disciplina Clericalis, vi. 12.</p>

  <p>2411. <i>Defenden</i>, forbid, i.&nbsp;e. advise one not to do. This
  passage is really a quotation from Cicero, De Officiis, i. 9:&mdash;'Bene
  praecipiunt qui uetant quidquid agere, quod dubites aequum sit an
  iniquum.'</p>

  <p>2413. The Lat. text has:&mdash;'Nunc superest uidere, quando consilium
  uel promissum mutari possit uel debeat.' This shews that the reading
  <i>counseil</i>, as in Hl., is correct.</p>

  <p>2415. Lat. text:&mdash;'Quae de nouo emergunt, nouo indigent consilio,
  ut leges dicunt.'</p>

  <p>2416. Lat. text:&mdash;'Inde et Seneca dixit, Consilium tuum si
  audierit hostis, consilii dispositionem permutes.' But no such sentence
  has been discovered in Seneca.</p>

  <p>2419. Lat. text:&mdash;'Generaliter enim nouimus, Turpes stipulationes
  nullius esse momenti, ut leges dicunt,' for which Sundby refers us to the
  Digesta, xlv. 1. 26.</p>

  <p>2421. 'Malum est consilium, quod mutari non potest': Publilius Syrus,
  Sent. 362.</p>

  <p>2431. <i>First and forward</i>; so in l. 2684. We now say 'first and
  foremost.'</p>

  <p>2436. See above, ll. 2311-2325; vol. iv. p. 208.</p>

  <p>2438. <i>Anientissed</i>, annulled, annihilated, done away with. In
  Rom. iv. 14, where Wycliffe's earlier text has <i>anentyschid</i>, the
  later text has <i>distried</i>. The Prompt. Parv. has: 'Anyyntyschyn, or
  enyntyschyn, <i>Exinanio</i>.' From O.&nbsp;F. <i>anientiss</i><span
  class="nw">-,</span> pres. pt. stem of <i>anientir</i>, to bring to
  nothing, variant of <i>anienter</i>, a verb formed from prep. <i>a</i>,
  to, and O. F. <i>nient</i> (Ital. <i>niente</i>, mod. F. <i>néant</i>),
  nothing. The form <i>nient</i> answers to Lat. *<i>ne-entem</i> or
  *<i>nec-entem</i>, from <i>ne</i>, <i>nec</i>, not, and <i>entem</i>,
  acc. of <i>ens</i>, being. See the New E. Dict. Cf. <i>anyente</i> in P.
  Plowman, C. xx. 267, xxi. 389. <i>As yow oghte</i>, as it behoved you;
  Hl. <i>as ye oughte</i>. Both phrases occur.</p>

  <p>2439. <i>Talent</i>; Fr. text, 'ta voulonte'; i.&nbsp;e. your desire, wish.
  '<i>Talent</i>, <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page212"></a>[212]</span>... will, desire, lust, appetite, an
  earnest humour unto'; Cotgrave. Cf. C. 540, and l. 2441 below.</p>

  <p>2444. This paragraph is omitted in MS. Hl.</p>

  <p>2447. <i>Hochepot</i>; Hl. <i>hochepoche</i>, whence E.
  <i>hodgepodge</i>. From F. <i>hochepot</i>, 'a hotch-pot, or
  gallimaufrey, a confused mingle-mangle of divers things jumbled or put
  together'; Cotgrave. This again is from the M. Du. <i>hutspot</i>, with
  the same sense; from <i>hutsen</i>, to shake, and <i>pot</i>. See
  <i>Hotchpot</i> in my Etym. Dict. <i>Ther been ye condescended</i>, and
  to that opinion ye have submitted.</p>

  <p>2449. <i>Reward</i>, regard; for <i>reward</i> is merely an older
  spelling of 'regard.' So in Parl. of Foules, 426; Leg. of Good Women,
  375, 399, 1622.</p>

  <p>2454. Lat. text:&mdash;'Humanum enim est peccare, diabolicum uero
  perseuerare.' Sundby refers us to St. Chrysostom, Adhortatio ad Theodorum
  lapsum, I. 14 (Opera, Paris, 1718, fol.; i. 26); where we find (in the
  Lat. version):&mdash;'Nam peccare quidem, humanum est; at in peccatis
  perseuerare, id non humanum est, sed omnino satanicum.' It is also quoted
  by Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum Historiale, lib. xvii. c. 45.</p>

  <p>2459. Lat. text:&mdash;'ad illorum officium spectat omnibus prodesse
  et nulli nocere.' This (says Sundby) is quoted from the Decretals of
  Gregory IX., lib. i. tit. 37. cap. 3.</p>

  <p>2467. Cf. Lat. text:&mdash;'scilicet, Contraria contrariis
  curantur.'</p>

  <p>2473. Fr. text:&mdash;'Or veez, dist Prudence, comment un chascun
  croist legierement ce qu'il veut et desire!'&mdash;Mr.</p>

  <p>2479. <i>For good</i>, &amp;c., 'namely, in the sense that good,'
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>2482. See Rom. xii. 17; cf. 1 Thess. v. 15; 1 Cor. iv. 12. The Lat.
  text quotes part of verses 17-21 of Rom. xii. But it is clear that
  Chaucer has altered the wording, and was thinking of 1 Pet. iii. 9.</p>

  <p>2485. After <i>wyse folk</i>, Cp. inserts 'and olde folk,' and Ln.
  'and the olde folke.' The Fr. text has: 'les advocas, les sages, et les
  anciens.' Ed. 1532 also inserts 'and olde folke'; and perhaps it should
  be inserted.</p>

  <p>2487. <i>Warnestore</i>, to supply with defensive materials, to
  garrison, protect; see 2521, 2523, 2525 below. 'And wel thei were
  <i>warnestured</i> of vitailes inow'; Will, of Palerne, 1121. We also
  find a sb. of the same form. 'In eche stude hii sette ther strong
  <i>warnesture</i> and god'; Rob. of Glouc. 2075 (ed. Hearne, p. 94). 'The
  Sarazins kept it [a castle] that tym for ther chefe <i>warnistour</i>';
  Rob. of Brunne, tr. of Langtoft, ed. Hearne, p. 180. 'I will remayn
  quhill this <i>warnstor</i> be gane'; Wallace, bk. ix. l. 1200, where ed.
  1648 has 'till all the stuffe be gone.' Correctly <i>warnisture</i>; a
  derivative of O.&nbsp;F. <i>warnir</i>, <i>garnir</i>, to supply (E.
  <i>garnish</i>). Godefroy gives O.&nbsp;F.'<i>garnesture</i>,
  <i>garnisture</i>, <i>garniture</i>, <i>warnesture</i>, s.&nbsp;f. provisions,
  ressource; authentication; garnison, forteresse'; with eight examples.
  Cf. E. <i>garrison</i> (M. E. <i>garnison</i>), <i>garment</i> (M. E.
  <i>garnement</i>), and <i>garniture</i>. The last of these is, in fact,
  nothing but the O.&nbsp;F. <i>warnisture</i> in a more modern <!-- Page 213
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>[213]</span>form. Hence we
  obtain the sense by consulting Cotgrave, who gives: '<i>Garniture</i>,
  garniture, garnishment, furniture; provision, munition, store, necessary
  implements.' It also appears that the word is properly a substantive,
  with the spelling <i>warnisture</i>; it became <i>warnistore</i> or
  <i>warnestore</i> by confusion with O.&nbsp;F. <i>estor</i>, a store; and, as
  the word <i>store</i> was easily made into a verb, it was easy to treat
  <i>warnestore</i> in the same way. It is a sb. in Rob. of Gloucester, as
  shewn above, but appears as a verb in Will. of Palerne. MS. Hl. has
  <i>warmstore</i> (with <i>m</i> for <i>ni</i>); and the same error is in
  the editions of Wright, Bell, and Morris. Ed. 1532 has
  <i>warnstore</i>.</p>

  <p>2494. From Ps. cxxvii. 1 (cxxvi. 1, Vulgate).</p>

  <p>2496. From Dionysius Cato, lib. iv. dist. 14:&mdash;'Auxilium a nobis
  petito, si forte laboras; Nec quisquam melior medicus quam fidus
  amicus.'</p>

  <p>2499. <i>Piers Alfonce</i>, Petrus Alfonsi, in his Disciplina
  Clericalis, xviii. 10:&mdash;'Ne aggrediaris uiam cum aliquo nisi prius
  eum cognoueris; si quisquam ignotus tibi in uia associauerit, iterque
  tuum inuestigauerit, dic te uelle longius ire quam disposueris; et si
  detulerit lanceam, uade ad dextram; si ensem, ad sinistram.'</p>

  <p>2505. The repetition of <i>that</i> before <i>ye</i>, following the
  former <i>that</i> before <i>for</i>, is due to a striving after greater
  clearness. It is not at all uncommon, especially in cases where the two
  <i>thats</i> are farther apart. Cf. the use of <i>he</i> and <i>him</i>
  in l. 2508.</p>

  <p><i>Lete the keping</i>, neglect the protection; A. S.
  <i>l&#x1E3;tan</i>.</p>

  <p>2507. 'Beatus homo qui semper est pauidus; qui uero mentis est durae,
  corruet in malum'; Prov. xxviii. 14. Hence the quotation-mark follows
  <i>bityde</i>.</p>

  <p>2509. <i>Counterwayte embusshements</i>, 'be on the watch against
  lyings in ambush.' '<i>Contregaitier</i>, v. act. épier, guetter de son
  côté'; refl. se garder, se mettre en garde'; Godefroy. Three examples are
  given of the active use, and four of the reflexive use. <i>Espiaille</i>,
  companies of spies; it occurs again in the sense of 'a set of spies' in
  D. 1323. Mätzner well remarks that <i>espiaille</i> does not mean
  'spying' or 'watching,' as usually explained, but is a <i>collective</i>
  sb., like O.&nbsp;F. <i>rascaille</i>, <i>poraille</i>, <i>pedaille</i>.
  Godefroy, in his O.&nbsp;F. Dict., makes the same mistake, though his own
  example is against him. He has: '<i>Espiaille</i>, s.&nbsp;f. action d'épier:
  Nous avons ja noveles par nos <i>espiailles</i>'; i.&nbsp;e. by means of our
  spies (not of our spyings). This quotation is from an A.&nbsp;F. proclamation
  made in London, July 26, 1347.</p>

  <p>2510. <i>Senek</i>, Seneca; but, as before, the reference is really to
  the Sentences of Publilius Syrus. Of these the Lat. text quotes no less
  than four, viz. Nos. 542, 607, 380, and 116 (ed. Dietrich); as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Qui omnes insidias timet, in nullas incidet.'</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Semper metuendo sapiens euitat malum.'</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Non cito perit ruina, qui ruinam timet.'</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Caret periculo, qui etiam [cum est] tutus cauet.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>[214]</span></p>

  <p>2514. <i>Senek</i>; this again is from Publilius Syrus, Sent.
  255:&mdash;'Inimicum, quamuis humilem, docti est metuere.'</p>

  <p>2515. The Lat. and Fr. texts both give the reference, correctly, to
  Ovid's Remedia Amoris; see l. 421:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Parva necat morsu spatiosum uipera taurum;</p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">A cane non magno saepe tenetur aper.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Chaucer has here interpolated the reference to 'the thorn pricking the
  king' between his translations of these two lines. The interpolation
  occurs neither in the French nor in the Latin text.</p>

  <p><i>Wesele</i>, weasel. The origin of this queer mistake is easily
  perceived. The Fr. text has: 'La petite <i>vivre</i> occist le grant
  torel.' Here <i>vivre</i> represents Lat. <i>uipera</i>, a viper (cf. E.
  <i>wivern</i>); but Ch. has construed it as if it represented Lat.
  <i>uiuerra</i>, a ferret.</p>

  <p>2518. <i>The book.</i> The quotation is from Seneca, Epist. 111. §
  3:&mdash;'Quidam fallere docuerunt, dum falli timent.' (<i>For</i> Quidam
  <i>read</i> Nam multi). Tyrwhitt's text is here imperfect, and he says he
  has patched it up as he best could; but the MSS. (except Cp. and Ln.)
  give a correct text.</p>

  <p>2520. Lat. text:&mdash;'Cum irrisore consortium non habeas; loquelae
  eius assiduitatem quasi toxica fugias.' From Albertano of Brescia, who
  here quotes from his own work, De Arte Eloquendi, p. cviii.; according to
  Sundby.</p>

  <p>2521. <i>Warnestore</i>, protect; see note to 2487 above, and see
  2523.</p>

  <p>2523. <i>Swiche as han</i>, 'such as castles and other kinds of
  edifices have.'</p>

  <p><i>Artelleries</i>, missile weapons; cf. 1 Sam xx. 40, 1 Macc. vi. 51
  (A. V.). 'Artillarie now a dayes is taken for ii. thinges: Gunnes and
  Bowes'; Ascham, Toxophilus, ed. Arber, p. 65. In Chaucer's time it
  referred to bows, crossbows, and engines for casting stones. Cotgrave
  explains F. <i>artillier</i> as 'one that maketh both bowes and
  arrowes.'</p>

  <p>2525-6. Owing to the repetition of the words <i>grete edifices</i>,
  one of the early scribes (whom others followed) passed from one to the
  other, thus omitting the words 'apperteneth som tyme to pryde and eek men
  make heighe toures and grete edifices.' But MSS. Cp. and Ln. supply all
  but the last three words 'and grete edifices,' and as we know that 'grete
  edifices' must recur, they really supply all but the sole word 'and,'
  which the sense absolutely requires. Curiously enough, these very MSS.
  omit the rest of clause 2525, so that none of the MSS. are perfect, but
  the text is easily pieced together. It is further verified by the Lat.
  text, which has:&mdash;'Munitio turrium et aliorum altorum aedificiorum
  ad superbiam plerumque pertinet ... praeterea turres cum magno labore et
  infinitis expensis fiunt; et etiam cum factae fuerint, nihil ualent, nisi
  cum auxilio prudentium et fidelium amicorum et cum magnis expensis
  defendantur.' The F. text supplies the gap with&mdash;'appartiennent
  aucune fois a orgueil: apres on fait les tours et les grans
  edifices.'&mdash;MS. Reg. 19 C. vii. leaf 133, back. Hence there is no
  doubt as to the reading. <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page215"></a>[215]</span></p>

  <p>All former editions are here defective, and supply the gap with the
  single word <i>is</i>, which is found in ed. 1532.</p>

  <p>2526. <i>With gret costages</i>, at great expense: Fr. text, 'a grans
  despens.'</p>

  <p><i>Stree</i>, straw; MS. Hl. has the spelling <i>straw</i>. We find
  the phrase again in the Book of the Duch. 671; also 'ne roghte of hem a
  <i>stree</i>,' id. 887; 'acounted <i>nat a stree</i>,' id. 1237; 'ne
  counted <i>nat three strees</i>,' id. 718.</p>

  <p>2530. Lat. text:&mdash;'unum est inexpugnabile munimentum, amor
  ciuium.' Not from Cicero; but from Seneca, De Clementia, i. 19. 5.</p>

  <p>2534. 'In omnibus autem negotiis, prius quam aggrediare, adhibenda est
  praeparatio diligens'; Cicero, De Officiis, i. 21.</p>

  <p>2537. Lat. text:&mdash;'Longa praeparatio belli celerem uictoriam
  facit.' But the source is unknown; it does not seem to be in Cicero.
  Mätzner quotes a similar saying from Publilius Syrus, Sent.
  125:&mdash;'Diu apparandum est bellum, ut uincas celerius.'</p>

  <p>2538. 'Munitio quippe tunc efficitur praeualida, si diuturna fuerit
  excogitatione roborata'; Cassiodorus, Variarum lib. i. epist. 17.</p>

  <p>2545. <i>Tullius.</i> This refers to what has already preceded in
  2391-2400, the passage referred to being one from Cicero's De Officiis,
  ii. 5, where we are bidden to consider several points, viz. (1) 'quid in
  quaque re uerum sincerumque sit; (2) quid consentaneum cuique rei sit;
  (3) quid consequens; (4) ex quo quidque gignatur; (5) quae cuiusque rei
  caussa sit.' All these five points are taken below in due order; viz. (1)
  in 2546; (2) in 2550; (3) in 2577; (4) in 2580; and (5) in 2583.</p>

  <p>2546. <i>Trouthe</i>; referring to <i>uerum</i> in clause (1) in the
  last note.</p>

  <p>2550. <i>Consentinge</i>; i.&nbsp;e. <i>consentaneum</i> in clause (2) in
  note to 2545. Cf. 2571. MS. Hl. has here the false reading
  <i>couetyng</i>, but in l. 2571 it has <i>consentynge</i>.</p>

  <p>2551. Lat. text:&mdash;'qui et quot et quales.' Thus <i>whiche</i>
  means 'of what sort.' The words <i>and whiche been they</i>, omitted in
  MS. E. only, are thus seen to be necessary; cf. l. 2552, where the phrase
  is repeated.</p>

  <p>2558. <i>Cosins germayns</i>; Lat. 'consanguineos germanos.' <i>Neigh
  kinrede</i>, relations near of kin; cf. 'nis but a fer kinrede' in
  2565.</p>

  <p>2561. <i>Reward</i>, regard, care; as above, in 2449; (see the
  note).</p>

  <p>2565. <i>Litel sib</i>, slightly related; <i>ny sib</i>, closely
  related. Cf. 'ne on his mæges láfe þe swa <i>néah sib</i> w&#x1FD;re,'
  nor with the relict of his kinsman who was so near of kin; Laws of King
  Cnut, § vii; in Thorpe's Ancient Laws, i. 364.</p>

  <p>2570. <i>As the lawe</i>; Sundby refers to Justinian's Codex, VIII.
  iv. 1.</p>

  <p>2573. <i>That nay</i>; Fr. text&mdash;'que non.'</p>

  <p>2577. <i>Consequent</i>; i.&nbsp;e. 'consequens' in clause (3), note to
  2545.</p>

  <p>2580. <i>Engendringe</i>; i.&nbsp;e. 'ex quo quidque gignatur' in clause
  (4), note to 2545.</p>

  <p>2582. Mätzner says this is corrupt; but it is quite right, though
  obscure. The sense is&mdash;'and, out of the taking of vengeance in
  return for that, would arise another vengeance'; &amp;c. <i>Engendre</i>
  is here taken <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>[216]</span>in the sense of 'be engendred' or 'breed';
  see the New E. Dict. The Fr. text is clearer: 'de la vengence <i>se
  engendrera</i> autre vengence.'</p>

  <p>2583. <i>Causes</i>; i.&nbsp;e. 'caussa' in clause (5), note to 2545.</p>

  <p>2585. The Lat. text omits <i>Oriens</i>, which seems to be here used
  as synonymous with <i>longinqua</i>. 'Caussa igitur iniuriae tibi illatae
  duplex fuit <i>efficiens</i>, scilicet <i>remotissima</i> et
  <i>proxima</i>.'</p>

  <p>2588. 'Occasio uero illius caussae, quae dicitur <i>caussa
  accidentalis</i>, fuit odium,' &amp;c. So below, the Lat. text has
  <i>caussa materialis</i>, <i>caussa formalis</i>, and <i>caussa
  finalis</i>.</p>

  <p>2591. <i>It letted nat</i>, it tarried not; Lat. text, 'nec per eos
  remansit.' This intransitive use of <i>letten</i> is awkward and rare. It
  occurs again in P. Plowman, C. ii. 204, xx. 76, 331.</p>

  <p>2594. <i>Book of Decrees</i>; Sundby refers us to the Decretum
  Gratiani; P. ii, Caussa 1, Qu. 1. c. 25:&mdash;'uix bono peraguntur
  exitu, quae malo sunt inchoata principio.'</p>

  <p>2596. <i>Thapostle</i>, the apostle Paul. The Lat. text refers
  expressly to the First Epistle to the Corinthians, meaning 1 Cor. iv. 5;
  but Chaucer has accommodated it to Rom. xi. 33.</p>

  <p>2600. The Lat. text informs us that <i>Melibeus</i> signifies <i>mel
  bibens</i>. For similar curiosities of derivation, see note to G. 87.
  There was a town called Meliboea (<span title="Meliboia" class="grk"
  >&Mu;&epsilon;&lambda;&#x1F77;&beta;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;</span>) on the
  E. coast of Thessaly.</p>

  <p>2605. From Ovid, Amor. i. 8. 104:&mdash;'Impia sub dulci melle uenena
  latent.'</p>

  <p>2606. From Prov. xxv. 16.</p>

  <p>2611. <i>The three enemys</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the flesh, the devil and the
  world. The entrance of these into man through the five senses is the
  theme of numerous homilies. See especially Sawles Warde, in O. Eng.
  Homilies, ed. Morris, First Series, p. 245; and the Ayenbite of Inwyt,
  ed. Morris, p. 263.</p>

  <p>2614. <i>Deedly sinnes</i>, the Seven Deadly Sins; see the Persones
  Tale. <i>Fyve wittes</i>, five senses; cf. P. Plowman, C. ii. 15, xvi.
  257.</p>

  <p>2615. <i>Wold</i>, willed; pp. of <i>willen</i>. F. text&mdash;'a
  voulu.' See 2190 above; Leg. of Good Women, 1209; Compl. of Venus, 11; P.
  Plowman, B. xv. 258; Malory's Morte Arthure, bk. xviii. c. 15&mdash;'[he]
  myghte haue slayne vs and he had <i>wold</i>'; and again, in c.
  19&mdash;'I myght haue ben maryed and I had <i>wolde</i>.' Gower
  has&mdash;'if that he had <i>wold</i>'; Conf. Amantis, ii. 9.</p>

  <p>2618. <i>Falle</i>, befall, come to pass; F. text&mdash;'advenir.'</p>

  <p>2620. <i>Were</i>, would be; F. text&mdash;'ce seroit moult grant
  dommage.'</p>

  <p>2623-4. The missing portion is easily supplied. The French text (MS.
  Reg. 19 C. vii, leaf 136) has:&mdash;'Et a ce respont Dame Prudence,
  Certes, dist elle, Ie t'octroye que de vengence vient molt de maulx et de
  biens; mais vengence n'appartient pas a vn chascun, fors seulement aux
  iuges et a ceulx qui ont la iuridicion sur les malfaitteurs.' Here 'mais
  vengence' should rather be 'mais faire vengence,' as in MS. Reg. 19 C.
  xi. leaf 59, back, and in the printed edition. It is <!-- Page 217
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>[217]</span>clear that the
  omission of this passage is due to the repetition of <i>trespassours</i>
  at the end of 2622 and 2624.</p>

  <p>2627. Lat. text&mdash;'nam, ut ait Seneca, Bonis nocet, qui malis
  parcit.' This corresponds to&mdash;'Bonis necesse est noceat, qui parcit
  malis'; Pseudo-Seneca, De Moribus, Sent. 114; see Publilius Syrus, ed.
  Dietrich, p. 90. The Fr. text has:&mdash;'Cellui nuit [<i>al.</i> nuist]
  aux bons, qui espargne les mauvais.' Chaucer's translation is so entirely
  at fault, that I think his MS. must have been corrupt; he has taken
  <i>nuist aux</i> as <i>maistre</i>, and then could make but little of
  <i>espargne</i>, which he makes to mean 'proveth,' i.&nbsp;e. tests, tries the
  quality of; perhaps his MS. had turned <i>espargne</i> (or
  <i>esparne</i>) into <i>esprouve</i>. MSS. Cp. Pt. Ln. turn it into
  <i>reproveth</i>; this makes better sense, but contradicts the original
  still more.</p>

  <p>2628. 'Quoniam excessus tunc sunt in formidine, cùm creduntur
  iudicibus displicere'; Cassiodorus, Variarum lib. i. epist. 4.</p>

  <p>2629. Lat. text:&mdash;'Et alibi dixit, Iudex, qui dubitat ulcisci,
  multos improbos facit'; slightly altered from Publ. Syrus, Sent.
  526:&mdash;'Qui ulcisci dubitat, inprobos plures facit.'</p>

  <p>2630. From Rom. xiii. 4. For <i>spere</i>, as in all the copies,
  Chaucer should have written <i>swerd</i>. The Fr. text has <i>glaive</i>;
  Lat. <i>gladium</i>.</p>

  <p>2632. <i>Ye shul retourne or have your recours to the Iuge</i>;
  explanatory of the F. text&mdash;'tu recourras au iuge.'</p>

  <p>2633. <i>As the lawe axeth and requyreth</i>; explanatory of the Fr.
  text&mdash;'selon droit.' For this use of <i>axeth</i> (= requires), cf.
  P. Plowman, C. i. 21, ii. 34.</p>

  <p>2635. <i>Many a strong pas</i>; Fr. text&mdash;'moult de fors pas.'
  MS. Hl. has:&mdash;'many a strayt passage.'</p>

  <p>2638. Not from Seneca, but (as in other places where Seneca is
  mentioned) from Publilius Syrus, Sent. 320 (ed. Dietrich):&mdash;'Male
  geritur, quicquid geritur fortunae fide.'</p>

  <p>2640. Again from Publilius Syrus, Sent. 189 (ed.
  Dietrich):&mdash;'Fortuna uitrea est; tum quum splendet frangitur.'</p>

  <p>2642. <i>Seur</i> (E. <i>sure</i>) and <i>siker</i> are mere variants
  of the same word; the former is O. F. <i>seur</i>, from Lat. acc.
  <i>sec&#x16B;rum</i>; the latter is from Lat. <i>séc&#x16D;rus</i>, with
  a different accentuation and a shortening of the second vowel. We also
  have a third form, viz. <i>secure</i>.</p>

  <p>2645. Again from Publ. Syrus, Sent. 173:&mdash;'Fortuna nimium quem
  fouet, stultum facit.'</p>

  <p>2650. From Rom. xii. 19; cf. Deut. xxxii. 35, Ps. xciv. 1.</p>

  <p>2653. From Publ. Syrus, Sent. 645:&mdash;'Veterem ferendo iniuriam
  inuites nouam.'</p>

  <p>2655. <i>Holden over lowe</i>, esteemed too low, too lightly.</p>

  <p>2656. From Publ. Syrus, Sent. 487:&mdash;'Patiendo multa [<i>al.</i>
  inulta] eueniunt [<i>al.</i> ueniunt] quae nequeas pati.' <i>Mowe
  suffre</i>, be able to endure. For <i>mowe</i>, Wright wrongly prints
  <i>nowe</i>; MS. Hl. has <i>mowe</i>, correctly. <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>[218]</span></p>

  <p>2663. From Caecilii Balbi Sententiae, ed. Friedrich, 1870, no.
  162:&mdash;'Qui non corripit peccantem gnatum, peccare imperat.'</p>

  <p>2664. 'And the judges and sovereign lords might, each in his own land,
  so largely tolerate wicked men and evil-doers,' &amp;c. Lat.
  text:&mdash;'si multa maleficia patiuntur fieri.'</p>

  <p>2667. <i>Let us now putte</i>, let us suppose; Fr.
  text&mdash;'posons.' A more usual phrase is 'putte cas,' put the case;
  cf. note to 2681.</p>

  <p>2668. <i>As now</i>, at present; see 2670.</p>

  <p>2671. From Seneca, De Ira, ii. 34, § 1:&mdash;'Cum pare contendere,
  anceps est; cum superiore, furiosum; cum inferiore, sordidum.'</p>

  <p>2675. From Prov. xx. 3.</p>

  <p>2678. From Publilius Syrus, Sent. 483:&mdash;'Potenti irasci sibi

  <p>2681. <i>Yet sette I caas</i>, but I will suppose; Fr.
  text&mdash;'posons,' as in 2667 above.</p>

  <p>2684. <i>First and foreward</i>; Fr. text&mdash;'premierement.' See
  note to 2431 above.</p>

  <p>2685. <i>The poete</i>; Fr. text, 'le poete.' Not in the Latin text,
  and the source of the quotation is unknown. Cf. Luke, xxiii. 41.</p>

  <p>2687. <i>Seint Gregorie.</i> Not in the Lat. text; source unknown.</p>

  <p>2692. From 1 Pet. ii. 21.</p>

  <p>2700. Referring to 2 Cor. iv. 17.</p>

  <p>2702. From Prov. xix. 11, where the Vulgate has:&mdash;'Doctrina uiri
  per patientiam noscitur.'</p>

  <p>2703. From Prov. xiv. 29, where the Vulgate has:&mdash;'Qui patiens
  est multa gubernatur prudentia.'</p>

  <p>2704. From Prov. xv. 18.</p>

  <p>2705. From Prov. xvi. 32.</p>

  <p>2707. From James, i. 4:&mdash;'Patientia autem opus perfectum
  habet.'</p>

  <p>2713. <i>Corage</i>, desire, inclination; cf. E. 1254.</p>

  <p>2715. The Fr. text is fuller: 'et si ie fais un grant exces, car on
  dit que exces n'est corrige que par exces, c'est a dire que oultrage ne
  se corrige fors que par oultrage.'&mdash;Mr. Perhaps part of the clause
  has been accidentally omitted, owing to repetition of 'exces.'</p>

  <p>2718. 'Quid enim discrepat a peccante, qui se per excessum nititur
  uindicare?'&mdash;Cassiodorus, Variarum lib. i. epist. 30.</p>

  <p>2721. Lat. text:&mdash;'ait enim Seneca, Nunquam scelus scelere
  uindicandum.' Not from Seneca; Sundby refers us to Martinus Dumiensis, De
  Moribus, S. 139.</p>

  <p>2723. <i>Withouten intervalle ... delay</i>; the Fr. text merely has
  'sans intervalle.' Chaucer explains the word <i>intervalle</i>.</p>

  <p>2729. 'Qui impatiens est sustinebit damnum'; Prov. xix. 19.</p>

  <p>2730. <i>Of that that</i>, in a matter that. <!-- Page 219 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>[219]</span></p>

  <p>2731. Lat. text (p. 95):&mdash;'Culpa est immiscere se rei ad se non
  pertinenti.' Sundby refers us to the Digesta, l. xvii. 36.</p>

  <p>2732. From Prov. xxvi. 17.</p>

  <p>2733. <i>Outherwhyle</i>, sometimes, occasionally; cf. 2857. So in Ch.
  tr. of Boethius, bk. iii. pr. 12. 119 (vol. ii. p. 89); P. Plowman, C.
  vi. 50, vii. 160, xxii. 103, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>2740. From Ecclesiastes, x. 19:&mdash;'pecuniae oboediunt omnia.'</p>

  <p>2741. All the copies have <i>power</i>; but, as Mätzner remarks, we
  should read <i>poverte</i>; the Fr. text has <i>povrete</i>.</p>

  <p>2743. <i>Richesses ben goode</i>; the Lat. text here quotes 1 Tim. iv.
  4.</p>

  <p>2744. 'Homo sine pecunia est quasi corpus sine anima' is written on a
  fly-leaf of a MS.; see my Pref. to P. Plowman, C-text, p. xx.</p>

  <p>2746. All the MSS. have <i>Pamphilles</i> instead of <i>Pamphilus</i>.
  The allusion is to Pamphilus Maurilianus, who wrote a poem, well-known in
  the fourteenth century, entitled <i>Liber de Amore</i>, which is extant
  in MSS. (e.g. in MS. Bodley 3703) and has been frequently printed.
  Tyrwhitt cites the lines here alluded to from the Bodley MS.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Dummodo sit diues cuiusdam nata bubulci,</p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">Eligit e mille, quem libet, illa uirum.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Sundby quotes the same (with <i>ipsa</i> for <i>illa</i>) from the
  Paris edition of 1510, fol. a iiii, recto. Chaucer again refers to
  Pamphilus in F. 1110, on which see the note.</p>

  <p>2748. This quotation is not in the Latin text, and is certainly not
  from Pamphilus; but closely follows Ovid's lines in his Tristia, i. 9.
  5:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Donec eris felix, multos numerabis amicos;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>See notes to B. 120 and B. 3436.</p>

  <p>2751. Neither is this from Pamphilus, but from some author quoted by
  Petrus Alfonsi, Discip. Cler. vi. 4, who says:&mdash;'ait quidam
  uersificator, Clarificant [<i>al.</i> Glorificant] gazae priuatos
  nobilitate.'</p>

  <p>2752. We know, from the Lat. text, that there is here an allusion to
  Horace, Epist. i. 6. 37:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Et genus et formam regina pecunia donat.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>2754. The Lat. text has <i>mater criminum</i>, and the Fr. text,
  <i>mere des crimes</i>. It is clear that Chaucer has misread
  <i>ruines</i> for <i>crimes</i>, or his MS. was corrupt; and he has
  attempted an explanation by subjoining a gloss of his own&mdash;'that is
  to seyn ... overthrowinge or fallinge doun.' The reference is to
  Cassiodorus, Variarum lib. ix. epist. 13:&mdash;'Ut dum <i>mater
  criminum</i> necessitas tollitur, peccandi ambitus auferatur.'</p>

  <p>2756. 'Est una de aduersitatibus huius saeculi grauioribus libero
  homini, quod necessitate cogitur, ut sibi subueniat, requirere inimicum';

  <p>2758. Lat. text:&mdash;'O miserabilis mendicantis conditio! Nam, si
  petit, pudore confunditur; et si non petit, egestate consumitur; sed ut

  <p>2762. 'Melior est mors quam uita amara'; Ecclus. xxx. 17. The Fr. text
  has:&mdash;'Mieulx vault la mort amere que telle vie'; where, as in
  Chaucer, the adjective is shifted.</p>

  <p>2765. <i>How ye shul have yow</i>, how you ought to behave yourself.
  In fact, <i>behave</i> is merely a compound of <i>be-</i> and
  <i>have</i>.</p>

  <p>2766. <i>Sokingly</i>, gradually. In the Prompt. Parv. we find 'Esyly,
  or <i>sokyngly</i>, Sensim, paulatim.' And compare the
  following:&mdash;'Domitius Corbulo vsed muche to saie, that a mannes
  enemies in battaill are to be ouercomed (<i>sic</i>) with a carpenters
  squaring-axe, that is to saie, <i>sokingly</i>, one pece after another. A
  common axe cutteth through at the first choppe; a squaring-axe, by a

  <p>2796. <i>Folily</i>, foolishly. We find M. E. <i>folliche</i>, both
  adj. and adv., and <i>follichely</i>, <i>folily</i> as adv. It is spelt
  <i>folily</i> in Wycliffe, Num. xii. 11, and in the Troy-book, 573; also
  <i>folili</i>, Will. of Palerne, 4596; <i>folyly</i>, Rom. of the Rose,

  <p>2829. The reference seems to be to Prov. xxv. 10 in the Vulgate
  version (not in the A. V.):&mdash;'Gratia et amicitia liberant; quas tibi
  serua, ne exprobrabilis fias.'</p>

  <p>2832. The reference is clearly to the following:&mdash;'Est enim
  indigni [<i>al.</i> digni] animi signum, famae diligere commodum';
  Cassiodorus, Variarum lib. i. epist. 4. This is quoted by Albertano (p.
  120), with the reading <i>ingenui</i> for <i>indigni</i>; hence Chaucer's
  'gentil.' Mätzner refers us to the same, lib. v. epist. 12:&mdash;'quia
  pulchrum est commodum famae.'</p>

  the multitude of an host; but strength cometh from heaven.' 1 Macc. iii.
  18, 19.</p>

  <p>2854. The gap is easily detected and filled up by comparison with the
  Fr. text, which Mätzner cites from Le Menagier de Paris, i. 226,
  thus:&mdash;'pour ce ... que nul n'est certain s'il est digne que Dieu
  lui doint victoire <i>ne plus que il est certain se il est digne de
  l'amour de Dieu</i> ou non.' We must also compare the text from Solomon,
  viz. Ecclesiastes, ix. 1, as it stands in the Vulgate version.</p>

  <p>2858. <i>The seconde book of Kinges</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Liber secundus Regum,
  now called 'the second book of Samuel.' The reference is to 2 Sam. xi.

  varies.</p>

  <p>2860. <i>In as muchel</i>; Fr. text:&mdash;'tant comme il puet

  handsomely, conveniently, orderly, to the purpose.'</p>

  <p>2861. <i>Salomon</i>; rather Jesus son of Sirach. 'He that loveth
  danger shall perish therein'; Ecclus. iii. 26.</p>

  <p>2863. <i>The werre ... nothing</i>, 'war does not please you at
  all.'</p>

  <p>2866. <i>Seint Iame</i> is a curious error for <i>Senek</i>, Seneca.
  For the Fr. text has:&mdash;'Seneque dit en ses escrips,' according to
  Mätzner; and MS. Reg. 19 C. xi (leaf 63, col. 2) has 'Seneques.' There
  has clearly been confusion between <i>Seneques</i> and <i>Seint
  iaques</i>. Hence the use of the pl. <i>epistles</i> is correct. The
  reference is to Seneca, Epist. 94, § 46; but Seneca, after all, is merely
  quoting Sallust:&mdash;'Nam concordia paruae res crescunt, discordia
  maximae dilabuntur'; Sallust, Jugurtha, 10.</p>

  litigious wrangling about any matter'; Cotgrave. See <i>Brigue</i> in the
  New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>2876. Here Hl. has <i>pryde</i> and <i>despysing</i> for
  <i>homlinesse</i> and <i>dispreysinge</i>, thus spoiling the sense. The
  allusion is to our common saying&mdash;Familiarity breeds contempt.</p>

  <p>2882. <i>The prophete</i>, i.&nbsp;e. David; Ps. xxxiv. 14.</p>

  <p>2883. The words 'as muchel as in thee is' are an addition, due to the
  Fr. text:&mdash;'tant comme tu pourras.'&mdash;Mr.</p>

  (Sundby). The Lat. text has:&mdash;'ubi est confessio, ibi est

<p class="ac"><b>The Monk's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>3079. The tale of <i>Melibee</i> (as told above) is about a certain
  Melibeus and his wife Prudence, who had a daughter called Sophie. One
  day, while Melibeus is absent, three of his enemies break into his house,
  beat his wife, and wound his daughter. On returning, he takes counsel as
  to what must be done. He is for planning a method of revenge, but his
  wife advises him to forgive the injuries, and in the end her counsels
  prevail.</p>

  <p>3082. <i>corpus Madrian</i>, body of Madrian: which has been
  interpreted in two ways. Urry guessed it to refer to St. Materne, bishop
  of Treves, variously commemorated on the 14th, 19th, or 25th of
  September, the days of his translations being July 18 and October 23. Mr.
  Steevens suggested, in a note printed in Tyrwhitt's Glossary, that the
  'precious body' was that of St. Mathurin, priest and confessor,
  commemorated on Nov. 1 or Nov. 9. The latter is more likely, since in his
  story in the Golden Legende, edit. 1527, leaf 151 back, the expressions
  'the precious body' and 'the holy body' occur, and the story explains
  that his body would not stay in the earth till it was carried back to
  France, where he had given directions that it should be buried.</p>

  <p>3083. 'Rather than have a barrel of ale, would I that my dear good
  wife had heard this story.' Cf. <i>morsel breed</i>, B. 3624.</p>

  <p><i>lief</i> is not a proper name, as has been suggested, I believe, by
  some one ignorant of early English idiom. Cf. 'Dear my lord,' Jul.
  Caesar, ii. 1. 255; and other instances in Abbott's Shakesp. Grammar,
  sect. 13.</p>

  <p>3101. 'Who is willing (<i>or</i> who suffers himself) to be overborne
  by everybody.'</p>

  <p>3108. <i>neighëbor</i>, three syllables; <i>thannè</i>, two
  syllables.</p>

  <p>3112. Observe the curious use of <i>seith</i> for <i>misseith</i>.</p>

  <p>3114. <i>Monk.</i> See him described in the Prologue, A. 165.</p>

  <p>3116. <i>Rouchester.</i> The MSS. have <i>Rouchester</i>, (Hl.
  <i>Rowchestre</i>), <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page225"></a>[225]</span>shewing that <i>Lo</i> stands alone in the
  first foot of the line. Tyrwhitt changed <i>stant</i> into
  <i>stondeth</i>, but all our seven MSS. have <i>stant</i>.</p>

  <p>According to the arrangement of the tales in Tyrwhitt's edition, the
  pilgrims reach Rochester <i>after</i> coming to Sittingborne (mentioned
  in the Wife of Bath's Prologue), though the latter is some eleven miles
  nearer Canterbury. The present arrangement of the Groups remedies this.
  See note to B. 1165, at p. 165.</p>

  <p>3117. <i>Ryd forth</i>, ride forward, draw near us.</p>

  <p>3119. <i>Wher</i>, whether. <i>dan</i>, for Dominus, a title of
  respect commonly used in addressing monks. But Chaucer even uses it of
  Arcite, in the Knightes Tale, and of Cupid, Ho. Fame, 137.</p>

  <p>3120. The monk's name was <i>Piers</i>. See B. 3982, and the note.</p>

  <p>3124. Cf. 'He was not pale as a for-pyned goost'; Prol. A. 205. Jean
  de Meun says, in his Testament, l. 1073, that the friars have good
  pastures (il ont bonnes pastures).</p>

  <p>3127. <i>as to my doom</i>, in my judgment.</p>

  <p>3130. Scan the line&mdash;Bút a góvernoúr wylý and wýs. The Petworth
  MS. inserts 'boþ' before 'wyly': but this requires the very unlikely
  accentuation 'govérnour' and an emphasis on <i>a</i>. The line would scan
  better if we might insert <i>art</i>, or <i>lyk</i>, after <i>But</i>,
  but there is no authority for this.</p>

  <p>3132. Read&mdash;<i>A wél-faríng persónë</i>, after which comes the
  pause, as marked in E. and Hn.</p>

  <p>3139. The monk's <i>semi-cope</i>, which seems to have been an ample
  one, is mentioned in the Prologue, A. 262. In Jack Upland, § 4, a friar
  is asked what is signified by his 'wide cope.'</p>

  <p>3142. 'Shaven very high on his crown'; alluding to the tonsure.</p>

  <p>3144. <i>the corn</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the chief part or share.</p>

  <p>3145. <i>borel men</i>, lay-men. <i>Borel</i> means 'rude, unlearned,
  ignorant,' and seems to have arisen from a peculiar use of <i>borel</i>
  or <i>burel</i>, sb., a coarse cloth; so that its original sense, as an
  adj., was 'in coarse clothing,' or 'rudely clad.' See <i>borrel</i> and
  <i>burel</i> in the New Eng. Dictionary.</p>

  <p><i>shrimpes</i>, diminutive or poor creatures.</p>

  <p>3146. <i>wrecched impes</i>, poor grafts, weakly shoots. Cf. A. S.
  <i>impian</i>, to graft, <i>imp</i>, a graft; borrowed from Low Lat.
  <i>impotus</i>, a graft, from Gk. <span title="emphutos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&mu;&phi;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, engrafted.</p>

  <p>3152. <i>lussheburghes</i>, light coins. In P. Plowman, B. xv. 342, we
  are told that 'in Lussheborwes is a lyther alay (bad alloy), and yet
  loketh he lyke a sterlynge.' They were spurious coins imported into
  England from Luxembourg, whence the name. See Liber Albus, ed. Riley,
  1841, p. 495; and Blount's Nomolexicon. Luxembourg is called
  <i>Lusscheburghe</i> in the Allit. Morte Arthure, l. 2388. The
  importation of this false money was frequently forbidden, viz. in 1347,
  1348, and 1351.</p>

  <p>3157. <i>souneth into</i>, tends to, is consistent with; see Prol. A.
  307, and Sq. Ta., F. 517. The following extracts from Palsgrave's French
  Dictionary are to the point. 'I sownde, I appartayne or belong, <i>Ie
  tens</i>. <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>[226]</span>Thys thyng sowndeth to a good purpose,
  <i>Ceste chose tent a bonne fin</i>.' Also, 'I sownde, as a tale or a
  report sowndeth to ones honesty or dyshonesty, <i>Ie redonde</i>. I
  promise you that this matter sowndeth moche to your dishonoure, <i>Ie
  vous promets que ceste matyere redonde fort a votre deshonneur</i>.'</p>

  <p>3160. <i>Seint Edward.</i> There are two of the name, viz. Edward,
  king and martyr, commemorated on March 16, 18, or 19, and the second King
  Edward, best known as Edward the Confessor, commemorated on Jan. 5. In
  Piers the Plowman, B. xv. 217, we have&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Edmonde and Edwarde · eyther were kynges,</p>
      <p>And seyntes ysette · tyl charite hem folwed.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But Edward the Confessor is certainly meant; and there is a remarkable
  story about him that he was 'warned of hys death certain dayes before hee
  dyed, by a ring that was brought to him by certain pilgrims coming from
  Hierusalem, which ring hee hadde secretly given to a poore man that askyd
  hys charitie in the name of God and sainte Johan the Evangelist.' See Mr.
  Wright's description of Ludlow Church, where are some remains of a
  stained glass window representing this story, in the eastern wall of the
  chapel of St. John. See also Chambers, Book of Days, i. 53, 54, where we
  read&mdash;'The sculptures upon the frieze of the present shrine (in
  Westminster Abbey) represent <i>fourteen scenes in the life</i> of Edward
  the Confessor.... He was canonized by Pope Alexander about a century
  after his death.... He was esteemed the <i>patron-saint of England</i>
  until superseded in the thirteenth century by St. George.' These fourteen
  scenes are fully described in Brayley's Hist. of Westminster Abbey, in an
  account which is chiefly taken from a life of St. Edward written by
  Ailred of Rievaulx in 1163. Three 'Lives of Edward the Confessor' were
  edited, for the Master of the Rolls, by Mr. Luard in 1858. See Morley's
  Eng. Writers, 1888, ii. 375.</p>

  <p>3162. <i>celle</i>, cell. The monk calls it <i>his</i> cell because he
  was 'the keper' of it; Prol. 172.</p>

  <p>3163. <i>Tragédie</i>; the final <i>ie</i> might be slurred over
  before <i>is</i>, in which case we might read <i>for to</i> for <i>to</i>
  (see footnote); but it is needless. The definition of 'tragedy' here
  given is repeated from Chaucer's own translation of Boethius, which
  contains the remark&mdash;'<i>Glose.</i> Tragedie is to seyn, a ditee
  [<i>ditty</i>] of a prosperitee for a tyme, that endeth in
  wrecchednesse'; bk. ii. pr. 2. 51. This remark is Chaucer's <i>own</i>,
  as the word <i>Glose</i> marks his addition to, or <i>gloss</i> upon, his
  original. His remark refers to a passage in Boethius immediately
  preceding, viz. 'Quid <i>tragoediarum</i> clamor aliud deflet, nisi
  indiscreto ictu fortunam felicia regna uertentem?' De Consolatione
  Philosophiae, lib. ii. prosa 2. See also the last stanza of 'Cresus' in
  the Monkes Tale (vol. i. p. 268).</p>

  <p>3169. <i>exametron</i>, hexameter. Chaucer is speaking of Latin, not
  of English verse; and refers to the common Latin hexameter used in heroic
  verse; he would especially be thinking of the Thebaid of Statius, <!--
  Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>[227]</span>the
  Metamorphoseon Liber of Ovid, the Aeneid of Vergil, and Lucan's
  Pharsalia. This we could easily have guessed, but Chaucer has himself
  told us what was in his thoughts. For near the conclusion of his Troilus
  and Criseyde, which he calls a <i>tragedie</i>, he says&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And kis the steppes wheras thou seest pace</p>
      <p><i>Virgile</i>, <i>Ovyde</i>, Omer, <i>Lucan</i>, and <i>Stace</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Lucan is expressly cited in B. 401, 3909.</p>

  <p>3170. <i>In prose.</i> For example, Boccaccio's De Casibus Virorum and
  De Claris Mulieribus contain 'tragedies' in Latin prose. Cf. ll. 3655,
  3910.</p>

  <p>3171. <i>in metre.</i> For example, the tragedies of Seneca are in
  various metres, chiefly iambic. See also note to l. 3285.</p>

  <p>3177. <i>After hir ages</i>, according to their periods; in
  chronological order. The probable allusion is to Boccaccio's De Casibus
  Virorum, which begins with Adam and Nimrod, and keeps tolerably to the
  right order. For further remarks on this, shewing how Chaucer altered the
  order of these Tragedies in the course of revision, see vol. iii. p.
  428.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Monkes Tale.</b></p>

  <p>For some account of this Tale, see vol. iii. p. 427.</p>

  <p>3181. <i>Tragédie</i>; accented on the second syllable, and riming
  with <i>remédie</i>; cf. B. 3163. Very near the end of Troilus and
  Criseyde, we find Chaucer riming it with <i>comédie</i>. That poem he
  also calls a tragedie (v. 1786)&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Go, litel book, go, litel myn <i>tragédie</i>,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>3183. <i>fillen</i>, fell. <i>nas no</i>, for <i>ne was no</i>, a
  double negative. Cf. Ch. tr. of Boethius&mdash;'the olde age of tyme
  passed, and eek of present tyme now, is ful of ensaumples how that kinges
  ben chaunged in-to wrecchednesse out of hir welefulnesse'; bk. iii. pr.
  5. 3.</p>

  <p>3186. The Harl. MS. has&mdash;'Ther may no man the cours of hir whiel
  holde,' which Mr. Wright prefers. But the reading of the Six-text is well
  enough here; for in the preceding line Chaucer is speaking of Fortune
  under the image of a person fleeing away, to which he adds, that no one
  can <i>stay her course</i>. Fortune is also sometimes represented as
  stationary, and holding an ever-turning wheel, as in the Book of the
  Duchesse, 643; but that is another picture.</p>

  <p>3188. <i>Be war by</i>, take warning from.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Lucifer.</b></p>

  <p>3189. <i>Lucifer</i>, a Latin name signifying <i>light-bringer</i>,
  and properly applied to the morning-star. In Isaiah xiv. 12 the Vulgate
  has&mdash;'Quomodo cecidisti de caelo, <i>Lucifer</i>, qui mane
  oriebaris? corruisti in terram, qui uulnerabas gentes?' &amp;c. St.
  Jerome, Tertullian, St. Gregory, and <!-- Page 228 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>[228]</span>other fathers, supposed
  this passage to apply to the fall of Satan. It became a favourite topic
  for writers both in prose and verse, and the allusions to it are
  innumerable. See note to Piers the Plowman, B. i. 105 (Clar. Press
  Series). Gower begins his eighth book of the Confessio Amantis with the
  examples of Lucifer and Adam.</p>

  <p>Sandras, in his Étude sur Chaucer, p. 248, quotes some French lines
  from a 'Volucraire,' which closely agree with this first stanza. But it
  is a common theme.</p>

  <p>3192. <i>sinne</i>, the sin of <i>pride</i>, as in all the accounts;
  probably from 1 Tim. iii. 6. Thus Gower, Conf. Amant. lib. i. (ed. Pauli,
  i. 153):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'For Lucifer, with them that felle,</p>
      <p>Bar <i>pride</i> with him into helle.</p>
      <p>Ther was pride of to grete cost,</p>
      <p>Whan he for pride hath heven lost.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>3195. <i>artow</i>, art thou. <i>Sathanas</i>, Satan. The Hebrew
  <i>sâtân</i> means simply an <i>adversary</i>, as in 1 Sam. xxix. 4; 2
  Sam. xix. 22; &amp;c. A remarkable application of it to the evil spirit
  is in Luke x. 18. Milton also indentifies Lucifer with Satan; Par. Lost,
  vii. 131; x. 425; but they are sometimes distinguished, and made the
  names of two different spirits. See, for example, Piers Plowman, B.
  xviii. 270-283.</p>

  <p>3196. Read <i>misérie</i>, after which follows the metrical pause.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Adam.</b></p>

  <p>3197. Boccaccio's De Casibus Virorum Illustrium begins with a chapter
  'De Adam et Eua.' It contains the passage&mdash;'Et ex agro, qui postea
  <i>Damascenus</i>,... ductus in Paradisum deliciarum.' Lydgate, in his
  Fall of Princes (fol. a 5), has&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Of slyme of the erthe, in <i>damascene</i> the feelde,</p>
      <p>God made theym aboue eche creature.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The notion of the creation of Adam in a field whereupon afterwards
  stood Damascus, occurs in Peter Comestor's Historia Scholastica, where we
  find (ed. 1526, fol. vii)&mdash;'Quasi quereret aliquis, Remansit homo in
  loco vbi factus est, in agro scilicet damasceno? Non. Vbi ergo translatus
  est? In paradisum.' See also Maundeville's Travels, cap. xv; Genesis and
  Exodus, ed. Morris, l. 207; and note in Mätzner's Altenglische
  Sprachproben, ii. 185.</p>

  <p>3199. Cf. 'Formatus est homo ... de spurcissimo spermate'; Innocent
  III., De Miseria Conditionis Humanae, i. 1 (Köppel).</p>

  <p>3200. So Boccaccio&mdash;'O caeca rerum cupiditas! Hii, <i>quibus
  rerum omnium</i>, dante Deo, <i>erat imperium</i>,' &amp;c. Cf. Gen. i.
  29; ii. 16.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Sampson.</b></p>

  <p>3205. The story of Sampson is also in Boccaccio, lib. i. c. 17 (not
  19, as Tyrwhitt says). But Chaucer seems mostly to have followed <!--
  Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>[229]</span>the
  account in Judges, xiii-xvi. The word <i>annunciat</i>, referring to the
  announcement of Samson's birth by the angel (Judges xiii. 3), may have
  been suggested by Boccaccio, whose account
  begins&mdash;'<i>Praenunciante</i> per angelum Deo, ex Manue Israhelita
  quodam et pulcherrima eius vxore Sanson progenitus est.' <i>thangel</i>
  in l. 3206=<i>the angel</i>.</p>

  <p>3207. <i>consecrat</i>, consecrated. A good example of the use of the
  ending <i><span class="nw">-at</span></i>; cf. <i>situate</i> for
  <i>situated</i>.&mdash;M. Shakespeare has <i>consecrate</i>; Com. of.
  Err. ii. 2. 134.</p>

  <p>3208. <i>whyl he mighte see</i>, as long as he preserved his
  eyesight.</p>

  <p>3210. <i>To speke of strengthe</i>, with regard to strength; <i>to
  speke of</i> is a kind of preposition.&mdash;M. Cf. Milton's Samson
  Agonistes, 126-150.</p>

  <p>3211. <i>wyves</i>. Samson told the secret of his riddle to his wife,
  Judges xiv. 17; and of his strength to Delilah, id. xvi. 17.</p>

  <p>3215. <i>al to-rente</i>, completely rent in twain. The prefix
  <i>to-</i> has two powers in Old English. Sometimes it is the preposition
  <i>to</i> in composition, as in <i>towards</i>, or M.&nbsp;E. <i>to-flight</i>
  (G. <i>zuflucht</i>), a refuge. But more commonly it is a prefix
  signifying <i>in twain</i>, spelt <i>zer-</i> in German, and <i>dis-</i>
  in M&oelig;so-Gothic and Latin. Thus <i>to-rente</i> = rent in twain;
  <i>to-brast</i> = burst in twain, &amp;c. The intensive adverb <i>al</i>,
  utterly, was used not merely (as is commonly supposed) before verbs
  beginning with <i>to-</i>, but in other cases also. Thus, in William of
  Palerne, l. 872, we find&mdash;'He was <i>al a-wondred</i>,' where
  <i>al</i> precedes the intensive prefix <i>a-</i> = A.&nbsp;S. <i>of</i>.
  Again, in the same poem, l. 661, we have&mdash;'<i>al bi-weped</i> for
  wo,' where <i>al</i> now precedes the prefix <i>bi-</i>. In Barbour's
  Bruce, ed. Skeat, x. 596, is the expression&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'For, hapnyt ony to slyde or fall,</p>
      <p>He suld be soyne <i>to-fruschit al</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Where <i>al to-fruschit</i> means utterly broken in pieces. Perhaps
  the clearest example of the complete separability of <i>al</i> from
  <i>to</i> is seen in l. 3884 of William of Palerne;&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Al to-tare</i> his atir · þat he <i>to-tere</i> mi&#x21D;t';</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. he entirely tore apart his attire, as much of it as he could
  tear apart. But at a later period of English, when the prefix <i>to-</i>
  was less understood, a new and mistaken notion arose of regarding <i>al
  to</i> as a separable prefix, with the sense of <i>all to pieces</i>. I
  have observed no instance of this use earlier than the reign of Henry
  VIII. Thus Surrey, Sonnet 9, has '<i>al-to</i> shaken' for shaken to
  pieces. Latimer has&mdash;'they love and <i>al-to</i> love (i.&nbsp;e.
  entirely love) him'; Serm. p. 289. For other examples, see <i>Al-to</i>
  in the Bible Word-book; and my notes in Notes and Queries, 3 Ser. xii.
  464, 535; also <i>All</i>, § C. 15, in the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>3220. Samson's wife was given to a friend; Judges, xiv. 20. She was
  afterwards burnt by her own people; Judges, xv. 6.</p>

  <p>3224. <i>on every tayl</i>; one brand being fastened to the tails of
  two foxes; Judg. xv. 4.</p>

  <p>3225. <i>cornes.</i> The Vulgate has <i>segetes</i> and <i>fruges</i>;
  also <i>utneas</i> for <!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page230"></a>[230]</span><i>vynes</i>, and <i>oliueta</i> for
  <i>oliveres</i>. The plural form <i>cornes</i> is not uncommon in Early
  English. Cf. 'Quen thair <i>corns</i> war in don,' i.&nbsp;e. when their
  harvests were gathered in; Spec. of Eng. pt. ii. ed. Morris and Skeat, p.
  70, l. 39. And again, 'alle men-sleeris and brenneris of houses and
  cornes [misprinted <i>corves</i>] ben cursed opynly in parische
  chirches'; Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 329.</p>

  <p>3234. <i>wang-toth</i>, molar tooth. This expression is taken from the
  Vulgate, which has&mdash;'Aperuit itaque Dominus <i>molarem dentem</i> in
  maxilla asini'; where the A.&nbsp;V. has only&mdash;'an hollow place that was
  in the jaw'; Judg. xv. 19.</p>

  <p>3236. <i>Judicum</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Liber Judicum, the Book of Judges. Cf.
  note to B. 93, at p. 141.</p>

  <p>3237. <i>Gazan</i>, a corruption of Gazam, the acc. case, in Judg.
  xvi. 1, Vulgate version.</p>

  <p>3244. <i>ne hadde been</i>, there would not have been. Since
  <i>hadde</i> is here the subjunctive mood, it is dissyllabic.
  Read&mdash;<i>worldë n' haddë</i>.</p>

  <p>3245. <i>sicer</i>, from the Lat. <i>sicera</i>, Greek <span
  title="sikera" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&#x1F77;&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;</span>, strong drink, is the
  word which we now spell <i>cider</i>; see Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, i.
  363, note. It is used here because found in the Vulgate version of Judges
  xiii. 7; 'caue ne uinum bibas, nec <i>siceram</i>.' I slightly amend the
  spelling of the MSS., which have <i>ciser</i>, <i>siser</i>,
  <i>sythir</i>, <i>cyder</i>. Wyclif has <i>sither</i>, <i>cyther</i>,
  <i>sidir</i>, <i>sydur</i>.</p>

  <p>3249. <i>twenty winter</i>, twenty years; Judg. xvi. 31. The English
  used to reckon formerly by <i>winters</i> instead of <i>years</i>; as may
  be seen in a great many passages in the A.&nbsp;S. Chronicle.</p>

  <p>3253. <i>Dalida</i>; from Gk. <span title="Dalida" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&alpha;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&#x1F71;</span>, in the Septuagint.
  The Vulgate has <i>Dalila</i>; but Chaucer (or his scribes) naturally
  adopted a form which seemed to have a nearer resemblance to an accusative
  case, such being, at that time, the usual practice; cf. <i>Briseide</i>
  (from <i>Briseida</i>), <i>Criseyde</i> and <i>Anelida</i>. Lydgate also
  uses the form <i>Dalida</i>.</p>

  <p>3259. <i>in this array</i>, in this (defenceless) condition.</p>

  <p>3264. <i>querne</i>, hand-mill. The Vulgate has&mdash;'et clausum in
  carcere molere fecerunt'; Judg. xvi. 21. But Boccaccio says&mdash;'ad
  <i>molas manuarias</i> coegere.' The word occurs in the House of Fame,
  1798; and in Wyclif's Bible, Exod. xi. 5; Mat. xxiv. 41. In the Ayenbite
  of Inwyt, ed. Morris, p. 181, the story of Samson is alluded to, and it
  is said of him that he 'uil [<i>fell</i>] into þe honden of his yuo
  [<i>foes</i>], þet him deden grinde <i>ate querne</i> ssamuolliche,'
  i.&nbsp;e. who made him grind at the mill shamefully (in a shameful manner).
  Lydgate copies Chaucer rather closely, in his Fall of Princes, fol. e
  7:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And of despite, after as I fynde,</p>
      <p>At their <i>quernes</i> made hym for to grinde.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>3269. <i>Thende</i>, the end. <i>Caytif</i> means (1) a captive, (2) a
  wretch. It is therefore used here very justly.</p>

  <p>3274. <i>two pilers</i>, better than the reading <i>the pilers</i> of
  MS. E.; because <i>two</i> are expressly mentioned; Judg. xvi. 29. <!--
  Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>[231]</span></p>

  <p>3282. So Boccaccio&mdash;'Sic aduersa credulitas, sic amantis pietas,
  sic mulieris egit inclyta fides. Vt quem non poterant homines, non
  uincula, non ferrum uincere, a mulieribus latrunculis uinceretur.'
  Lydgate has the expressions&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Beware by Sampson your counseyll well to kepe,</p>
      <p>Though [<i>misprinted</i> That] Dalida compleyne, crye, and wepe';</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and again:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Suffre no nightworm within your counseyll crepe,</p>
      <p>Though Dalida compleyne, crye, and wepe.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="ac"><b>Hercules.</b></p>

  <p>3285. There is little about Hercules in Boccaccio; but Chaucer's
  favourite author, Ovid, has his story in the Metamorphoses, book ix, and
  Heroides, epist. 9. Tyrwhitt, however, has shewn that Chaucer more
  immediately copies a passage in Boethius, de Cons. Phil. lib. iv. met. 7,
  which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Herculem duri celebrant labores;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But it is still more interesting to see Chaucer's own version of this
  passage, which is as follows (ed. Morris, p. 147; cf. vol. ii. p.
  125):&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Hercules is celebrable for his harde trauaile; he dawntede þe proude
  Centauris, half hors, half man; and he rafte þe despoylynge fro þe cruel

  sustenede þe heuene upon his nekke unbowed; &amp; he deseruede eftsones
  þe heuene, to ben þe pris of his laste trauayle.'</p>

  <p>And in his House of Fame, book iii. (l. 1413), he mentions&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Alexander, and Hercules,</p>
      <p>That with a sherte his lyf lees.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>3288. Hercules' first labour was the slaying of the Nemean lion, whose
  skin he often afterwards wore.</p>

  <p>3289. <i>Centauros</i>; this is <i>the very form</i> used by Boethius,
  else we might have expected <i>Centaurus</i> or <i>Centaures</i>. After
  the destruction of the Erymanthian boar, Hercules slew Pholus the
  centaur; and (by accident) Chiron. His slaughter of the centaur Nessus
  ultimately brought about his own death; cf. l. 3318.</p>

  <p>3290. <i>Arpies</i>, harpies. The sixth labour was the destruction of
  the Stymphalian birds, who ate human flesh.</p>

  <p>3291. The eleventh labour was the fetching of the golden apples,
  guarded by the dragon Ladon, from the garden of the Hesperides.</p>

  <p>3292. The twelfth labour was the bringing of Cerberus from the lower
  world.</p>

  <p>3293. <i>Busirus.</i> Here Chaucer has confused two stories. One is,
  that Busiris, a king of Egypt, used to sacrifice all foreigners who came
  to Egypt, till the arrival of Hercules, who slew him. The other is 'the
  eighth labour,' when Hercules killed Diomedes, a king in Thrace, who fed
  his mares with human flesh, till Hercules slew him and gave his body to
  be eaten by the mares, as Chaucer <i>himself</i> says in his translation.
  The confusion was easy, because the story of Busiris is mentioned
  elsewhere by Boethius, bk. ii. pr. 6, in a passage which Chaucer thus
  translates (see vol. ii. p. 43):&mdash;'I have herd told of Busirides,
  þat was wont to sleen his gestes [<i>guests</i>] þat herberweden
  [<i>lodged</i>] in his hous; and he was sleyn him-self of Ercules þat was
  his gest.' Lydgate tells the story of Busiris correctly.</p>

  <p>3295. <i>serpent</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the Lernean hydra, whom Chaucer, in the
  passage from Boethius, calls 'Idra [<i>or</i> Ydra] the serpent.'</p>

  <p>3296. <i>Achelois</i>, seems to be used here as a genitive form from
  <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page233"></a>[233]</span>a nominative <i>Achelo</i>; in his
  translation of Boethius we find <i>Achelous</i> and <i>Achelaus</i>. The
  spelling of names by old authors is often vague. The line means&mdash;he
  broke one of the two horns of Achelous. The river-god Achelous, in his
  fight with Hercules, took the form of a bull, whereupon the hero broke
  off one of his horns.</p>

  <p>3297. The adventures with Cacus and Antaeus are well known.</p>

  <p>3299. The fourth labour was the destruction of the Erymanthian
  boar.</p>

  <p>3300. <i>longe</i>, for a long time; in the margin of MS. Camb. Univ.
  Lib. Dd. 4. 24, is written the gloss <i>diu</i>.</p>

  <p>3307. The allusion is to the 'pillars' of Hercules. The expression
  'both ends of the world' refers to the extreme points of the continents
  of Europe and Africa, <i>world</i> standing here for <i>continent</i>.
  The story is that Hercules erected two pillars, Calpe and Abyla, on the
  two sides of the Strait of Gibraltar. The words 'seith Trophee' seem to
  refer to an author named Trophaeus. In Lydgate's prologue to his Fall of
  Princes, st. 41, he says of Chaucer that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'In youth he made a translacion</p>
      <p>Of a boke whiche called is <i>Trophe</i></p>
      <p>In Lumbarde tonge, as men may rede and se;</p>
      <p>And in our vulgar, long er that he deyde,</p>
      <p>Gave it the name of Troylus and Creseyde.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This seems to say that <i>Trophe</i> was the Italian name of a Book
  (or otherwise, the name of a book in Italian), whence Chaucer drew his
  story of Troilus. But the notion must be due to some mistake, since that
  work was taken from the 'Filostrato' of Boccaccio. The only trace of the
  name of <i>Trophaeus</i> as an author is in a marginal
  note&mdash;possibly Chaucer's own&mdash;which appears in both the
  Ellesmere and Hengwrt MSS., viz. 'Ille vates Chaldeorum Tropheus.' See,
  however, vol. ii. p. lv, where I shew that, in <i>this</i> passage at any
  rate, <i>Trophee</i> really refers to Guido delle Colonne, who treats of
  the deeds of Hercules in the first book of his Historia Troiana, and
  makes particular mention of the famous columns (as to which Ovid and
  Boethius are alike silent).</p>

  <p>3311. <i>thise clerkes</i>, meaning probably Ovid and Boccaccio. See
  Ovid's Heroides, epist. ix., entitled Deianira Herculi, and Metamorph.
  lib. ix.; Boccaccio, De Casibus Virorum Illustrium, lib. i. cap. xviii.,
  and De Mulieribus Claris, cap. xxii. See also the Trachineae of
  Sophocles, which Chaucer of course never read.</p>

  <p>3315. <i>wered</i>, worn; so in A. 75, and B. 3320, <i>wered</i> is
  the form of the past tense. Instances of verbs with weak preterites in
  Chaucer, but strong ones in modern English, are rare indeed; but there
  are several instances of the contrary, e.g. <i>wep</i>, <i>slep</i>,
  <i>wesh</i>, <i>wex</i>, now <i>wept</i>, <i>slept</i>, <i>washed</i>,
  <i>waxed</i>. <i>Wore</i> is due to analogy with <i>bore</i>; cf.
  <i>could</i> for <i>coud</i>.</p>

  <p>3317. Both Ovid and Boccaccio represent Deianira as ignorant of the
  fatal effects which the shirt would produce. See Ovid, Metam. <!-- Page
  234 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>[234]</span>ix. 133.
  Had Chaucer written later, he might have included Gower among the clerks,
  as the latter gives the story of Hercules and Deianira in his Conf.
  Amantis, lib. ii. (ed. Pauli, i. 236), following Ovid. Thus he
  says&mdash;</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Nabugodonosor.</b></p>

  <p>3335. <i>Nabugodonosor</i>; generally spelt <i>Nabuchodonosor</i> in
  copies of the Vulgate, of which this other spelling is a mere variation.
  Gower has the same spelling as Chaucer, and relates the story near the
  end of book i. of the Conf. Amantis (ed. Pauli, i. 136). Both no doubt
  took it directly from Daniel i-iv.</p>

  <p>3338. <i>The vessel</i> is here an imitation of the French idiom; F.
  <i>vaisselle</i> means <i>the plate</i>, as Mr. Jephson well observes.
  Cf. l. 3494.</p>

  <p>3349. In the word <i>statue</i> the second syllable is rapidly slurred
  over, like that in <i>glorie</i> in l. 3340. See the same effect in the
  Kn. Tale, ll. 117, 1097 (A. 975, 1955).</p>

  <p>3356. <i>tweye</i>, two; a strange error for <i>three</i>, whose names
  are familiar; viz. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Balthasar.</b></p>

  <p>3373. <i>Balthasar</i>; so spelt by Boccaccio, who relates the story
  very briefly, De Cas. Virorum Illust., lib. ii. cap. 19. So also, by
  Peter Comestor, in his Historia Scholastica; and by Gower, Conf. Amant.,
  lib. v (ed. Pauli, ii. 365). The Vulgate generally has <i>Baltassar</i>;
  Daniel, cap. v.</p>

  <p>3379. <i>and ther he lay</i>; cf. l. 3275 above.</p>

  <p>3384. The word <i>tho</i> is supplied for the metre. The scribes have
  considered <i>vesselles</i> (<i>sic</i>) as a trisyllable; but see ll.
  3391, 3416, 3418.</p>

  <p>3388. <i>Of</i>, for. Cf. 'thank God <i>of</i> al,' i.&nbsp;e. for all; in
  Chaucer's Balade of Truth.&mdash;M. See note in vol. i. pp. 552-3.</p>

  <p>3422. Tyrwhitt has <i>trusteth</i>, in the plural, but <i>thou</i> is
  used throughout. Elsewhere Chaucer also has '<i>on</i> whom we
  <i>truste</i>,' Prol. A. 501; '<i>truste on</i> fortune,' B. 3326; cf.
  'syker <i>on</i> to trosten,' P. Pl. Crede, l. 350.</p>

  <p>3429-36. I have no doubt that this stanza was a later addition.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class="ac"><b>Zenobia.</b></p>

  <p>3437. <i>Cenobia.</i> The story of Zenobia is told by Trebellius
  Pollio, who flourished under Constantine, in cap. xxix. of his work
  entitled Triginta Tyranni; but Chaucer no doubt followed later accounts,
  one of which was clearly that given by Boccaccio in his De Mulieribus
  Claris, cap. xcviii. Boccaccio relates her story again in his De Casibus
  Virorum, lib. viii. c. 6; in an edition of which, printed in 1544, I find
  references to the biography of Aurelian by Flavius Vopiscus, to the
  history of Orosius, lib. vii. cap. 23, and to Baptista Fulgosius, lib.
  iv. cap. 3. See, in particular, chap. xi. of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of
  the Roman Empire, where the story of Zenobia is given at length. Palmyra
  is described by Pliny, Nat. Hist. lib. v. cap. 21. Zenobia's ambition
  tempted her to endeavour to make herself a Queen of the East, instead of
  remaining merely Queen of Palmyra; but she was defeated by the Roman
  emperor Aurelian, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 273, and carried to Rome,
  where she graced his triumph, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 274. She
  survived this reverse of fortune for some years.</p>

  <p><i>Palimerie.</i> Such is the spelling in the best MSS.; but MS. Hl.
  reads&mdash;'of Palmire the queene.' It is remarkable that MS. Trin.
  Coll. Cam. R. 3. 19 has the reading&mdash;'Cenobia, of <i>Belmary</i>
  quene,' which suggests confusion with <i>Belmarie</i>, in the Prol. A.
  57; but see the note to that line. It occupied the site of the ancient
  Tadmor, or 'city of palmtrees,' in an oasis of the Great Syrian desert.
  It has been in ruins since about <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1400.</p>

  <p>3441. In the second <i>ne in</i>, the <i>e</i> is slurred over; cf.
  <i>nin</i>, Sq. Ta., F. 35.</p>

  <p>3442. <i>Perse.</i> This (like l. 3438) is Chaucer's mistake.
  Boccaccio says expressly that she was of the race of the Ptolemies of
  Egypt; but further <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page236"></a>[236]</span>on he remarks&mdash;'Sic cum <i>Persis</i>
  et Armenis principibus, vt illos urbanitate et facetia superaret.' This
  may account for the confusion.</p>

  <p>3446. Boccaccio says (de Mul. Clar.)&mdash;'Dicunt autem hanc a
  pueritia sua spretis omnino muliebribus <i>officiis</i>, cum iam
  corpusculum eduxisset in robur, syluas &amp; nemora incoluisse plurimum,
  &amp; accinctam pharetra, ceruis caprisque cursu atque sagittis fuisse
  infestam. Inde cum in acriores deuenisset uires, ursus amplecti ausam,
  pardos, leonesque insequi, obuios expectare, capere &amp; occidere, ac in
  praedam trahere.' This accounts for the word <i>office</i>, and may shew
  how closely Chaucer has followed his original.</p>

  <p>3496. <i>lafte not</i>, forbore not; see A. 492.</p>

  <p>3497. She was acquainted with Egyptian literature, and studied Greek
  under the philosopher Longinus, author of a celebrated treatise on 'The
  Sublime.'</p>

  <p>3502. <i>housbonde.</i> Her husband was Odenathus, or Odenatus, the
  ruler of Palmyra, upon whom the emperor Gallienus had bestowed the title
  of Augustus. He was murdered by some of his relations, and some have even
  insinuated that Zenobia consented to the crime. Most scribes spell the
  name <i>Onedake</i>, by metathesis for <i>Odenake</i> (<i>Odenate</i>),
  like the spelling <i>Adriane</i> for <i>Ariadne</i>.</p>

  <p>3507. <i>doon hem flee</i>, cause them (her and her husband) to
  flee.</p>

  <p>3510. Sapor I. reigned over Persia <span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  240-273. He defeated the emperor Valerian, whom he kept in captivity for
  the rest of his life. After conquering Syria and taking Caesarea, he was
  defeated by Odenatus and Zenobia, who founded a new empire at Palmyra.
  See Gibbon, Decline, &amp;c., chap. x.</p>

  <p>3511. <i>proces</i>, succession of events. <i>fil</i>, fell,
  befell.</p>

  <p>3512. <i>title</i>, pronounced nearly as <i>title</i> in French, the
  <i>e</i> being elided before <i>had</i>.</p>

  <p>3515. <i>Petrark.</i> Tyrwhitt suggests that perhaps Boccaccio's book
  had fallen into Chaucer's hands under the name of Petrarch. We may,
  however, suppose that Chaucer had read the account in a borrowed book,
  and did not certainly know whether Petrarch or Boccaccio was the author.
  Instances of similar mistakes are common enough in Early English. Modern
  readers are apt to forget that, in the olden times, much information had
  to be carried in the memory, and there was seldom much facility for
  verification or for a second perusal of a story.</p>

  <p>3519. <i>cruelly.</i> The Harl. MS. has the poor reading
  <i>trewely</i>, miswritten for <i>crewely</i>.</p>

  <p>3525. Claudius II., emperor of Rome, <span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  268-270. He succeeded Gallienus, as Chaucer says, and was succeeded by
  Aurelian.</p>

  <p>3535. Boccaccio calls them <i>Heremianus</i> and <i>Timolaus</i>, so
  that <i>Hermanno</i> (as in the MSS.) should probably be
  <i>Heremanno</i>. Professor Robertson Smith tells me that the right names
  are <i>Herennianus</i> and <i>Timoleon</i>. The line cannot well be
  scanned as it stands.</p>

  <p>3550. <i>char</i>, chariot. Boccaccio describes this 'currum, quem
  sibi ex auro gemmisque praeciocissimum Zenobia fabricari fecerat.' <!--
  Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>[237]</span></p>

  <p>3556. <i>charged</i>, heavily laden. She was so laden with chains of
  massive gold, and covered with pearls and gems, that she could scarcely
  support the weight; so says Boccaccio. Gibbon says the same.</p>

  <p>3562. <i>vitremyte.</i> I have no doubt this reading (as in Tyrwhitt)
  is correct. All the six MSS. in the Six-text agree in it. The old printed
  editions have <i>were autremyte</i>, a mere corruption of <i>were a
  u&#x129;tremyte</i>; and the Harl. MS. has <i>wyntermyte</i>, which I
  take to be an attempt to make sense of a part of the word, just as we
  have turned <i>écrevisse</i> into <i>cray-fish</i>. What the word means,
  is another question; it is perhaps the greatest 'crux' in Chaucer. As the
  word occurs nowhere else, the solution I offer is a mere guess. I suppose
  it to be a coined word, formed on the Latin <i>vitream mitram</i>,
  expressing, literally, a glass head-dress, in complete contrast to a
  strong helmet. My reasons for supposing this are as follows.</p>

  <p>(1) With regard to <i>mitra</i>. In Low-Latin, its commonest meaning
  is a woman's head-dress. But it was especially and widely used as a term
  of mockery, both in Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. The <i>mitra</i>
  was the cap which criminals were made to wear as a sign of degradation;
  see Carpenter's Supp. to Ducange, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Mitra</i>; Vocabulario degli
  Accad. della Crusca, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Mitera</i>; and any large Spanish Dict.
  s.&nbsp;v. <i>Mitra</i>. Even Cotgrave has&mdash;'<i>Mitré</i>, mitred; hooded
  with a <i>miter</i>, wearing a <i>miter</i>; set on a pillory or
  scaffold, with a <i>miter</i> of paper on his head.' The chief difficulty
  in this derivation is the loss of the <i>r</i>, but Godefroy has a
  quotation (s.&nbsp;v. <i>mite</i>, 2), which would suit the
  sense&mdash;'<i>mites</i> de toile costonnees, et par dessus ung grand
  chappel de fer ou de cuir bouilli.'</p>

  <p>(2) With regard to <i>vitream</i>. This may refer to a proverb,
  probably rather English than foreign, to which I have never yet seen a
  reference. But its existence is clear. To give a man 'a glazen hood'
  meant, in Old English, to mock, delude, cajole. It appears in Piers the
  Plowman, B. xx. 171, where a story is told of a man who, fearing to die,
  consulted the physicians, and gave them large sums of money, for which
  they gave him in return 'a glasen houve,' i.&nbsp;e. a <i>hood of glass</i>, a
  thing that was no defence at all. Still clearer is the allusion to the
  same proverb <i>in Chaucer</i> himself, in a passage explained by no
  previous editor, in Troil. and Cres. v. 469, where Fortune is said to
  have an intention of deluding Troilus; or, as the poet says,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Fortune his <i>howve</i> entended bet <i>to glase</i>,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. literally, Fortune intended <i>to glaze his hood</i> still
  better for him, i.&nbsp;e. to make a still greater fool of him. In the Aldine
  edition, <i>howue</i> is printed <i>howen</i> in this passage, but
  <i>howue</i> occurs elsewhere; Tyrwhitt has <i>hove</i>, a common
  variation of <i>howue</i>. If this note is unsatisfactory, I may yet
  claim to have explained in it at least <i>one</i> long-standing
  difficulty; viz. this line in Troilus. Tyrwhitt long ago explained that,
  in Chaucer, the phrases <i>to set a man's hood</i>, and <i>to set a man's
  cap</i>, have a like meaning, viz. to delude him. Chaucer uses
  <i>verre</i> for glass <!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page238"></a>[238]</span>in another passage of a similar character,
  viz. in Troil. and Cres. ii. 867, where we read&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And forthy, who that hath an hede of <i>verre</i>,</p>
      <p>Fro cast of stones war him in the werre.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>3564. <i>a distaf.</i> This is from Boccaccio's <i>other</i> account,
  in the De Casibus Virorum. 'Haec nuper imperatoribus admiranda, nunc
  uenit miseranda plebeis. Haec nunc galeata concionari militibus assueta,
  nunc uelata cogitur muliercularum audire fabellas. Haec nuper Orienti
  praesidens sceptra gestabat, nunc Romae subiacens, colum, sicut ceterae,
  baiulat.' Zenobia survived her disgrace for some years, living at Rome as
  a private person on a small estate which was granted to her, and which,
  says Trebellius Pollio, 'hodie <i>Zenobia</i> dicitur.'</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Peter, King of Spain.</b></p>

  <p>3565. See vol. iii. p. 429, for the <i>order</i> in which the parts of
  the Monk's Tale are arranged. I follow here the arrangement in the
  Harleian MS. Peter, king of Castile, born in 1334, is generally known as
  Pedro the Cruel. He reigned over Castile and Leon from 1350 to 1362, and
  his conduct was marked by numerous acts of unprincipled atrocity. After a
  destructive civil war, he fell into the hands of his brother, Don Enrique
  (Henry). A personal struggle took place between the brothers, in the
  course of which Enrique stabbed Pedro to the heart; March 23, 1369. See
  the ballad by Sir Walter Scott, entitled the Death of Don Pedro, in
  Lockhart's Spanish Ballads, commencing&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Henry and Don Pedro clasping</p>

      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">Brother proves his strength with brother.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is remarkable that Pedro was very popular with his own party,
  despite his crimes, and Chaucer takes his part because our Black Prince
  fought on the side of Pedro against Enrique at the battle of Najera,
  April 3, 1367; and because John of Gaunt married Constance, daughter of
  Pedro, about Michaelmas, 1371.</p>

  <p>3573. See the description of Du Gueschlin's arms as given below. The
  'field' was argent, and the black eagle appears as if <i>caught</i> by a
  rod covered with birdlime, because the bend dexter across the shield
  seems to restrain him from flying away. The first three lines of the
  stanza refer to Bertrand Du Gueschlin, who 'brew,' i.&nbsp;e. contrived
  Pedro's murder, viz. by luring him to Enrique's tent. But the last three
  lines refer to another knight who, according to Chaucer, took a still
  more active part in the matter, being a <i>worker</i> in it. This second
  person was a certain Sir Oliver Mauny, whose name Chaucer conceals under
  the synonym of <i>wicked nest</i>, standing for O. Fr. <i>mau ni</i>,
  where <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page239"></a>[239]</span><i>mau</i> is O. Fr. for <i>mal</i>, bad
  or wicked, and <i>ni</i> is O. Fr. for <i>nid</i>, Lat. <i>nidus</i>, a
  nest. Observe too, that Chaucer uses the word <i>need</i>, not
  <i>deed</i>. There may be an excellent reason for this; for, in the
  course of the struggle between the brothers, Enrique was at first thrown,
  'when (says Lockhart) one of Henry's followers, seizing Don Pedro by the
  leg, turned him over, and his master, thus at length gaining the upper
  hand, instantly stabbed the king to the heart. Froissart calls this man
  the Vicomte de Roquebetyn, and others the Bastard of Anisse.' I have no
  doubt that Chaucer means to tell us that the helper in Enrique's
  <i>need</i> was no other than Mauny. He goes on to say that this Mauny
  was not like Charles the Great's Oliver, an honourable peer, but an
  Oliver of Armorica, a man like Charles's Ganelon, the well-known traitor,
  of whom Chaucer elsewhere says (Book of the Duchess, l. 1121)&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Or the false Genelon,</p>
      <p>He that purchased the treson</p>
      <p>Of Rowland and of Olivere.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This passage has long been a puzzle, but was first cleared up in an
  excellent letter by Mr. Furnivall in Notes and Queries, which I here
  subjoin; I may give myself the credit, however, of identifying 'wicked
  nest' with O. Fr. <i>mau ni</i>.</p>

  <p>'The first two lines [of the stanza] describe the arms of Bertrand du
  Guesclin, which were, a black double-headed eagle displayed on a silver
  shield, with a red band across the whole, from left to right [in heraldic
  language, a bend dexter, gules]&mdash;"the lymrod coloured as the glede"
  or live coal&mdash;as may be seen in Anselme's <i>Histoire Généalogique
  de France</i>, and a MS. <i>Généalogies de France</i> in the British
  Museum. Next, if we turn to Mr. D. F. Jamison's excellent <i>Life and
  Times of Bertrand du Guesclin</i>, we not only find on its cover
  Bertrand's arms as above described, but also at vol. ii. pp. 92-4, an
  account of the plot and murder to which Chaucer alludes, and an
  identification of his traitorous or "Genylon" Oliver, with Sir Oliver de
  Mauny of Brittany (or Armorica), Bertrand's cousin [or, according to
  Froissart, cap. 245, his nephew].</p>

  <p>'After the battle of Monteil, on March 14, 1369, Pedro was besieged in
  the castle of Monteil near the borders of La Mancha, by his brother
  Enrique; who was helped by Du Guesclin and many French knights. Finding
  escape impossible, Pedro sent Men Rodriguez secretly to Du Guesclin with
  an offer of many towns and 200,000 gold doubloons if he would desert
  Enrique and reinstate Pedro. Du Guesclin refused the offer, and "the next
  day related to his friends and kinsmen in the camp, and <i>especially to
  his cousin, Sir Oliver de Mauny</i>, what had taken place." He asked them
  if he should tell Enrique; they all said yes: so he told the king.
  Thereupon Enrique promised Bertrand the same reward that Pedro had
  offered him, but asked him also to assure Men Rodriguez of Pedro's safety
  if he would come to his (Du Guesclin's) lodge. Relying on Bertrand's
  assurance, Pedro came to him on <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page240"></a>[240]</span>March 23; Enrique entered the lodge
  directly afterwards, and after a struggle, stabbed Pedro, and seized his
  kingdom.</p>

  <p>'We see then that Chaucer was justified in asserting that Du Guesclin
  and Sir Oliver Mauny "brew this cursednesse"; and his assertion has some
  historical importance; for as his patron and friend, John of Gaunt,
  married one of Pedro's daughters [named Constance] as his second wife
  [Michaelmas, 1371], Chaucer almost certainly had the account of Pedro's
  death from his daughter, or one of her attendants, and is thus a witness
  for the truth of the narrative of the Spanish chronicler Ayala, given
  above, against the French writers, Froissart, Cuvelier, &amp;c., who make
  the Bégue de Villaines the man who inveigled Pedro. This connexion of
  Chaucer with John of Gaunt and his second wife must excuse the poet in
  our eyes for calling so bad a king as Pedro the Cruel "worthy" and "the
  glorie of Spayne, whom Fortune heeld so hy in magestee."</p>

  <p>'In the Corpus MS. these knights are called in a side-note
  Bertheu<i>n</i> Clayky<i>n</i> (which was one of the many curious ways in
  which Du Guesclin's name was spelt) and Olyu<i>er</i> Mawny; in MS. Harl.
  1758 they are called Barthilmewe Claykeynne and Olyuer Mawyn; and in MS.
  Lansdowne 851 they are called Betelmewe Claykyn and Oliuer Mawnye. Mauni
  or Mauny was a well-known Armorican or Breton family. Chaucer's epithet
  of "Genilon" for Oliver de Mauny is specially happy, because Genelon was
  the Breton knight who betrayed to their death the great Roland and the
  flower of Charlemagne's knights to the Moors at Roncesvalles. Charles's
  or Charlemagne's great paladin, Oliver, is too well known to need more
  than a bare mention.'&mdash;F. J. Furnivall, in Notes and Queries, 4th

<p class="ac"><b>Peter, King of Cyprus.</b></p>

  <p>3581. In a note to Chaucer's Prologue, A. 51, Tyrwhitt
  says&mdash;'Alexandria in Egypt was won, and immediately afterwards
  abandoned, in 1365, by Pierre de Lusignan, king of Cyprus. The same
  Prince, soon after his accession to the throne in 1352, had taken
  Satalie, the antient Attalia; and in another expedition about 1367 he
  made himself master of the town of Layas in Armenia. Compare 11 Mémoire
  sur les Ouvrages de Guillaume de Machaut, Acad. des Ins. tom. xx. pp.
  426, 432, 439; and Mémoire sur la Vie de Philippe de Maizières, tom.
  xvii. p. 493.' He was assassinated in 1369. Cf. note to A. 51.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Barnabo of Lombardy.</b></p>

  <p>3589. 'Bernabo Visconti, duke of Milan, was deposed by his nephew and
  thrown into prison, where he died in 1385.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. This date of
  Dec. 18, 1385 is that of the <i>latest circumstance</i> incidentally
  referred to in the Canterbury Tales. Chaucer had been sent to treat with
  Visconti <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>[241]</span>in 1378, so that he knew him personally.
  See Froissart, bk. ii. ch. 158; Engl. Cyclopaedia, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Visconti</i>;
  Furnivall's Trial Forewords, p. 109. And see vol. i. p. xxxii.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Ugolino of Pisa.</b></p>

  <p>3597. 'Chaucer himself has referred us to Dante for the original of
  this tragedy: see Inferno, canto xxxiii.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. An account of
  Count Ugolino is given in a note to Cary's Dante, from Villani, lib. vii.
  capp. 120-127. This account is different from Dante's, and represents him
  as very treacherous. He made himself master of Pisa in July 1288, but in
  the following March was seized by the Pisans, who threw him, with his two
  sons, and two of his grandsons, into a prison, where they perished of
  hunger in a few days. Chaucer says <i>three sons</i>, the eldest being
  five years of age. Dante says <i>four sons</i>.</p>

  <p>3606. <i>Roger</i>; i.&nbsp;e. the Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, who
  was Ugolino's enemy.</p>

  <p>3616. This line is imperfect at the caesura; accent <i>but</i>.
  Tyrwhitt actually turns <i>herde</i> into <i>hered</i>, to make it
  dissyllabic; but such an 'emendation' is not legitimate. The Harl. MS.
  has&mdash;'He herd it wel, but he <i>saugh</i> it nought'; where Mr.
  Jephson inserts <i>ne</i> before <i>saugh</i> without any comment.
  Perhaps read&mdash;he [ne] spak.</p>

  <p>3651. <i>Dant</i>; i.&nbsp;e. Dante Alighieri, the great poet of Italy,
  born in 1265, died Sept. 14, 1321. Chaucer mentions him again in his
  House of Fame, book i., as the author of the Inferno, in the Prologue to
  the Legend of Good Women, l. 360, and in the Wyf of Bathes Tale, D.
  1126.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Nero.</b></p>

  <p>3655. <i>Swetonius</i>; this refers to the Lives of the Twelve Caesars
  by Suetonius; but it would be a mistake to suppose that Chaucer has
  followed his account very closely. Our poet seems to have had a habit of
  mentioning authorities whom he did not <i>immediately</i> follow, by
  which he seems to have meant no more than that they were good authorities
  upon the subject. Here, for instance, he merely means that we can find in
  Suetonius a good account of Nero, which will give us all minor details.
  But in reality he draws the story more immediately from other sources,
  especially from Boccaccio, De Casibus Virorum, lib. vii. cap. 4, from the
  Roman de la Rose, and from Boethius, de Cons. Philos. lib. ii. met. 6,
  and lib. iii. met. 4. The English Romaunt of the Rose does not contain
  the passage about Nero, but it is interesting to refer to Chaucer's
  translation of Boethius. Vincent of Beauvais has an account of Nero, in
  his Speculum Historiale, lib. ix. capp. 1-7, in which he chiefly follows
  Suetonius. See also Orosius, lib. vii. 7, and Eutropius, lib. vii.</p>

  <p>3657. <i>South</i>; the MSS. have <i>North</i>, but it is fair to make
  the correction, as Chaucer certainly knew the sense of
  <i>Septemtrioun</i>, and the expression is merely borrowed from the Roman
  de la Rose, ed. Méon, l. 6271, where we read,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Cis desloiaus, que ge ci di;</p>
      <p>Et d'Orient et de <i>Midi</i>,</p>
      <p>D'Occident, de Septentrion</p>
      <p>Tint il la juridicion.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And, in his Boethius, after saying that Nero ruled from East to West,
  he adds&mdash;'And eke þis Nero gouernede by Ceptre alle þe peoples þat
  ben vndir þe colde sterres þat hy&#x21D;ten þe seuene triones; þis is to
  seyn, he gouernede alle þe poeples þat ben vndir þe parties of þe norþe.
  And eke Nero gouerned alle þe poeples þat þe violent wynde Nothus
  scorchiþ, and bakiþ þe brennynge sandes by his drie hete; þat is to
  seyne, alle þe poeples in þe <i>souþe</i>'; ed. Morris, p. 55 (cf. vol.
  ii. p. 45).</p>

  <p>3663. From Suetonius; cf. Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer, ii. 285.</p>

  <p>3665. This is from Suetonius, who says&mdash;'Piscatus est rete
  aurato, purpura coccoque funibus nexis'; cap. xxx. So also Orosius, vii.
  7; Eutropius, vii. 9.</p>

  <p>3669. This passage follows Boethius, bk. ii. met. 6, very closely, as
  is evident by comparing it with Chaucer's translation (see vol. ii. p.
  44). 'He leet brenne the citee of Rome, and made sleen the senatoures.
  And he, cruel, whylom slew his brother. And he was maked <!-- Page 243
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>[243]</span>moist with the
  blood of his moder; that is to seyn, he leet sleen and slitten the body
  of his moder, to seen wher he was conceived; and he loked on every halve
  upon her colde dede body; ne no tere ne wette his face; but he was so
  hard-herted that he mighte ben domesman, or Iuge, of hir dede beautee....
  Allas, it is a grevous fortune, as ofte as wikked swerd is ioigned to
  cruel venim; that is to seyn, venimous crueltee to lordshippe.' Thus
  Chaucer himself explains <i>domesman</i> (l. 3680) by <i>Iuge</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
  judge. In the same line <i>ded-è</i> is dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>3685. <i>a maister</i>; i.&nbsp;e. Seneca, mentioned below by name. In the
  year 65, Nero, wishing to be rid of his old master, sent him an order to
  destroy himself. Seneca opened a vein, but the blood would not flow
  freely; whereupon, to expedite its flow, he entered into a warm bath, and
  thence was taken into a vapour stove, where he was suffocated. 'Nero
  constreynede Senek, his familier and his mayster, to chesen on what deeth
  he wolde deyen'; Chaucer's Boethius, lib. iii. pr. 5. 34 (vol. ii.
  63).</p>

  <p>3692. 'It was long before tyranny or any other vice durst attack him';
  literally, 'durst let dogs loose against him.' To <i>uncouple</i> is to
  release dogs from the leash that fastened them together; see P. Pl. B.
  pr. 206. Compare&mdash;</p>

  <p>3720. 'Where he expected to find some who would aid him.' Suetonius
  says&mdash;'ipse cum paucis hospitia singulorum adiit. Verum clausis
  omnium foribus, respondente nullo, in cubiculum rediit,' &amp;c.; cap.
  xlvii. He afterwards escaped to the villa of his freedman Phaon, four
  miles from Rome, where he at length gave himself a mortal wound in the
  extremity of his despair. Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 6459-76.</p>

  <p>3736. <i>girden of</i>, to strike off; cf. '<i>gurdeth</i> of gyles
  hed,' P. Pl. B. ii. 201. A <i>gird</i> is also a sharp striking taunt or
  quip.&mdash;M.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Holofernes.</b></p>

  <p>3746. <i>Oloferne.</i> The story of Holofernes is to be found in the
  apocryphal book of Judith.</p>

  <p>3750. <i>For lesinge</i>, for fear of losing, lest men should
  lose.</p>

  <p>3752. 'He had decreed to destroy all the gods of the land, that all
  nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only,' &amp;c.; Judith, iii. 8.</p>

  <p>3756. <i>Eliachim.</i> Tyrwhitt remarks that the name of the high
  priest was Joacim; Judith, iv. 6. But this is merely the form of the name
  in our English version. The Vulgate version has the equivalent form
  <i>Eliachim</i>; cf. 2 Chron. xxxvi. 4.</p>

  <p>3761. <i>upright</i>, i.&nbsp;e. on his back, with his face upwards. See
  Knightes Tale, l. 1150 (A. 2008), and the note to A. 4194. <!-- Page 244

<p class="ac"><b>Antiochus.</b></p>

  <p>3765. Antiochus Epiphanes, King of Syria (<span class="sm">B.C.</span>
  175-164). Paraphrased from 2 Maccabees, ix. 7, 28, 10, 8, 7, 3-7, 9-12,
  28.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Alexander.</b></p>

  <p>3821. There is a whole cycle of Alexander romances, in Latin, French,
  and English, so that his story is common enough. There is a good life of
  him by Plutarch, but in Chaucer's time the principal authority for an
  account of him was Quintus Curtius. See Ten Brink, Hist. Eng. Lit., bk.
  ii. sect. 8.</p>

  <p>3826. 'They were glad to send to him (to sue) for peace.'</p>

  <p>3843. <i>write</i>, should write, pt. subj.; hence the change of vowel
  from indic. <i>wroot</i>.&mdash;M. The <i>i</i> is short.</p>

  <p>3845. 'So Alexander reigned twelve years, and then died'; 1 Mac. i. 7.
  <i>Machabee</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the first book of the Maccabees.</p>

  <p>3850. Quintus Curtius says that Alexander was poisoned by Antipater;
  and this account is adopted in the romances. Cf. Barbour's Bruce, i.
  533.</p>

  <p>3851. 'Fortune hath turned thy <i>six</i> (the highest and most
  fortunate throw at dice) into an <i>ace</i> (the lowest).' Cf. note to B.
  124.</p>

  <p>3860. 'Which two (fortune and poison) I accuse of all this woe.'</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Julius Caesar.</b></p>

  <p>3862. For <i>humble bed</i> Tyrwhitt, Wright, and Bell print
  <i>humblehede</i>, as in some MSS. But this word is an objectionable
  hybrid compound, and I think it remains to be shewn that the word belongs
  to our language. In the Knightes Tale, Chaucer has <i>humblesse</i>, and
  in the Persones Tale, <i>humilitee</i>. Until better authority for
  <i>humblehede</i> can be adduced, I am content with the reading of the
  four best MSS., including the Harleian, which Wright <i>silently
  alters</i>.</p>

  <p>3863. <i>Julius.</i> For this story Chaucer refers us below to Lucan,
  Suetonius, and Valerius; see note to l. 3909. There is also an
  interesting life of him by Plutarch. Boccaccio mentions him but
  incidentally.</p>

  <p>3866. <i>tributárie</i>; observe the rime with <i>aduersárie</i>.
  <i>Fortune</i> in l. 3868 is a trisyllable; so also in l. 3876.</p>

  <p>3870. 'Against Pompey, thy father-in-law.' Rather, 'son-in-law'; for
  Caesar gave Pompey his daughter Julia in marriage.</p>

  <p>3875. <i>puttest</i>; to be read as <i>putt'st</i>; and
  <i>thórient</i> as in l. 3883.</p>

  <p>3878. <i>Pompeius.</i> Boccaccio gives his life at length, as an
  example of misfortune; De Casibus Virorum, lib. vi. cap. 9. He was killed
  Sept. 29, <span class="sm">B.C.</span> 48, soon after the battle of
  Pharsalia in Thessaly (l. 3869).</p>

  <p>3881. <i>him</i>, for himself; but in the next line it means 'to
  him.'&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>3885. Chaucer refers to this triumph in the Man of Lawes Tale, B. 400;
  but see the note. Cf. Shak. Henry V, v. prol. 28. <!-- Page 245 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>[245]</span></p>

  <p>3887. Chaucer is not alone in making Brutus and Cassius into
  <i>one</i> person; see note to l. 3892.</p>

  <p>3891. <i>cast</i>, contrived, appointed; pp., after <i>hath</i>.</p>

  <p>3892. <i>boydekins</i>, lit. bodkins, but with the signification of
  daggers. It is meant to translate the Lat. <i>pugio</i>, a poniard. In
  Barbour's Bruce, i. 545, Caesar is said to have been slain with a weapon
  which in one edition is called <i>punsoun</i>, in another a
  <i>botkin</i>, and in the Edinburgh MS. a <i>pusoune</i>, perhaps an
  error for <i>punsoune</i>, since Halliwell's Dictionary gives the form
  <i>punchion</i>. Hamlet uses <i>bodkin</i> for a dagger; Act iii. sc. 1.
  l. 76. In the margin of Stowe's Chronicle, ed. 1614, it is said that
  Caesar was slain with <i>bodkins</i>; Nares' Glossary. Nares also
  quotes&mdash;'The chief woorker of this murder was <i>Brutus Cassius</i>,
  with 260 of the senate, all having <i>bodkins</i> in their sleeves';
  Serp. of Division, prefixed to Gorboduc, 1590.</p>

  <p>3906. <i>lay on deying</i>, lay a-dying. In l. 3907, <i>deed</i> =
  mortally wounded.</p>

  <p>3909. <i>recomende</i>, commit. He means that he commits the full
  telling of the story to Lucan, &amp;c. In other words, he refers the
  reader to those authors. Cf. Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer, ii. 254,
  274.</p>

  <p>Lucan (born <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 39, died <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 65) was the author of the Pharsalia, an incomplete
  poem in ten books, narrating the struggle between Pompey and Caesar.
  There is an English translation of it by Rowe.</p>

  <p>Suetonius Tranquillus (born about <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 70)
  wrote several works, the principal of which is The Lives of the Twelve
  Caesars.</p>

  <p>Valerius. There were two authors of this name, (1) Valerius Flaccus,
  author of a poem on the Argonautic expedition, and (2) Valerius Maximus,
  author of De Factis Dictisque Memorabilibus Libri ix. Mr. Jephson says
  that Valerius Flaccus is meant here, I know not why. Surely the reference
  is to Valerius Maximus, who at least tells some anecdotes of Caesar; lib.
  iv. c. 5; lib. vii. cap. 6.</p>

  <p>3911. <i>word and ende</i>, beginning and end; a substitution for the
  older formula <i>ord and ende</i>. Tyrwhitt notes that the suggested
  emendation of <i>ord</i> for <i>word</i> was proposed by Dr. Hickes, in
  his Anglo-Saxon Grammar, p. 70. Hickes would make the same emendation in
  Troil. and Cres. v. 1669;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And of this broche he tolde him <i>ord and ende</i>,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>where the editions have <i>word</i>. He also cites the expression
  <i>ord and ende</i> from Cædmon; see Thorpe's edition, p. 225, l. 30. We
  also find <i>from orde &#x14D;ð ende</i> = from beginning to end, in the
  poem of Elene (Vercelli MS.), ed. Grein, l. 590. <i>Orde and ende</i>
  occurs also at a later period, in the Ormulum, l. 6775; and still later,
  in Floriz and Blancheflur, l. 47, ed. Lumby, in the phrase,</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Hu blauncheflur was þarinne isold.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Tyrwhitt argues that the true spelling of the phrase had already
  become <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>[246]</span>corrupted in Chaucer's time, and such
  seems to have been the fact, as all the MSS. have <i>word</i>. See
  Zupitza's note to Guy of Warwick, l. 7927, where more examples are given;
  and cf. my note to Troil. ii. 1495. <i>Ord and ende</i> explains our
  modern <i>odds and ends</i>; see Garnett's Essays, p. 37. Moreover, it is
  not uncommon to find a <i>w</i> prefixed to a word where it is not
  required etymologically, especially before the vowel <i>o</i>. The
  examples <i>wocks</i>, oaks, <i>won</i>, one, <i>wodur</i>, other,
  <i>wostus</i>, oast-house, <i>woth</i>, oath, <i>wots</i>, oats,
  <i>wolde</i>, old, are all given in Halliwell's Prov. Dictionary.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Croesus.</b></p>

  <p>3917. <i>Cresus</i>; king of Lydia, <span class="sm">B.C.</span>
  560-546, defeated by Cyrus at Sardis. Cyrus spared his life, and Croesus
  actually survived his benefactor. Chaucer, however, brings him to an
  untimely end. The story of Croesus is in Boccaccio, De Casibus Virorum,
  lib. iii. cap. 20. See also Herodotus, lib. 1; Plutarch's life of Solon,
  &amp;c. But Boccaccio represents Croesus as surviving his disgraces.
  Tyrwhitt says that the story seems to have been taken from the Roman de
  la Rose, ll. 6312-6571 (ed. Méon); where the English Romaunt of the Rose
  is defective. In Chaucer's translation of Boethius, bk. ii. pr. 2, see
  vol. ii. p. 28, we find this sentence: 'Wistest thou not how Cresus, the
  king of Lydiens, of whiche king Cyrus was ful sore agast a litel biforn,
  that this rewliche [<i>pitiable</i>] Cresus was caught of [<i>by</i>]
  Cyrus, and lad to the fyr to ben brent; but that a rayn descendede doun
  fro hevene, that rescowede him?' In the House of Fame, bk. i. ll. 104-6,
  we have an allusion to the 'avision' [<i>vision</i>, dream] of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Cresus, that was king of Lyde,</p>
      <p>That high upon a gebet dyde.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>See also Nonne Pr. Ta. l. 318 (B. 4328). The tragic version of the
  fate of Croesus is given by Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum Historiale,
  iii. 17; and I give an extract, as it seems to be the account which is
  followed in the Roman de la Rose. It must be premised that Vincent makes
  Croesus to have been taken prisoner by Cyrus <i>three times</i>.</p>

  <p>'Alii historiographi narrant, quod in secunda captione, iussit eum

  Cumque postea hoc sibi prospere euenisse gloriaretur, et opum copia

  <p>3951. The passage here following is repeated from the Monkes Prologue,
  and copied, as has been said, from Boethius, bk. ii. pr. 2. It is to be
  particularly noted that the passage quoted from Boethius in the note to
  B. 3917 almost immediately precedes the passage quoted in the note to B.
  3163.</p>

  <p>3956. See note to B. 3972 below.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Nonne Prestes Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>3957. <i>the knight.</i> See the description of him, Prol. A. 43.</p>

  <p>3961. <i>for me</i>, for myself, for my part. Cp. the phrase 'as for
  me.'&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>3970. 'By the bell of Saint Paul's church (in London).'</p>

  <p>3972. The host alludes to the concluding lines of the Monkes Tale, l.
  3956, then repeats the words <i>no remedie</i> from l. 3183, and cites
  the word <i>biwaille</i> from l. 3952. Compare all these passages.</p>

  <p>3982. <i>Piers.</i> We must suppose that the host had by this time
  learnt the monk's name. In B. 3120 above, he did not know it.</p>

  <p>3984. 'Were it not for the ringing of your bells'; lit. were there not
  a clinking of your bells (all the while). 'Anciently no person seems to
  have been gallantly equipped on horseback, unless the horse's bridle or
  some other part of the furniture was stuck full of small bells. Vincent
  of Beauvais, who wrote about 1264, censures this piece of pride in the
  knights-templars; Hist. Spec. lib. xxx. c. 85'; &amp;c.&mdash;Warton,
  Hist. Eng. Poetry (ed. Hazlitt), ii. 160; i. 264. See also note to Prol.
  A. 170.</p>

  <p>3990. 'Ubi auditus non est, non effundas sermonem'; Ecclus. xxxii. 6.
  (Vulgate); the A. V. is different. See above, B. 2237. The common
  proverb, 'Keep your breath to cool your broth,' nearly expresses what
  Chaucer here intends.</p>

  <p>3993. <i>substance</i> is explained by Tyrwhitt to mean 'the material
  part of a thing.' Chaucer's meaning seems not very different from
  Shakespeare's in Love's La. Lost, v. 2. 871&mdash;</p>

  <p>3995. 'For the propriety of this remark, see note to Prol. A. 166';
  Tyrwhitt.</p>

  <p>4000. <i>Sir</i>; 'The title of <i>Sir</i> was usually given, by
  courtesy, to priests, both secular and regular'; Tyrwhitt. Tyrwhitt also
  remarks that, 'in the principal modern languages, John, or its
  equivalent, is a name of contempt or at least of slight. So the Italians
  use <i>Gianni</i>, from whence <i>Zani</i> [Eng. <i>zany</i>]; the
  Spaniards <i>Juan</i>, as <i>Bobo Juan</i>, a foolish John; the French
  <i>Jean</i>, with various additions.' The reason (which Tyrwhitt failed
  to see) is simply that <i>John</i> is one of the commonest of common
  names. For example, twenty-three popes took that name; and cf. our phrase
  <i>John</i> Bull, which answers to the French <i>Jean</i> Crapaud, and
  the Russian <i>Ivan</i> Ivanovitch, 'the embodiment of the peculiarities
  of the Russian people'; Wheeler's Noted Names of Fiction. Ivan Ivanovitch
  would be John Johnson in English and Evan Evans in Welsh. Hence <i>sir
  John</i> became the usual contemptuous name for a priest; see abundant
  examples in the Index to the Parker Society's publications.</p>

  <p>4004. <i>serve</i> has two syllables; hence <i>rek</i>, in the Harl.
  MS., is perhaps better than <i>rekke</i> of the other MSS. <i>A bene</i>,
  the value of a bean; in the Milleres Tale <i>a kers</i> (i.&nbsp;e. a blade of
  grass) occurs in a similar manner (A. 3756); which has been corrupted
  into 'not caring a <i>curse</i>'!</p>

  <p>4006. <i>Ye</i>, yea, is a mild form of assent; <i>yis</i> is a
  stronger form, generally followed, as here, by some form of asseveration.
  See note to B. 1900 above.</p>

  <p>4008. <i>attamed</i>, commenced, begun. The Lat. <i>attaminare</i> and
  Low Lat. <i>intaminare</i> are equivalent to <i>contaminare</i>, to
  contaminate, soil, spoil. From Low Lat. <i>intaminare</i> comes F.
  <i>entamer</i>, to cut into, attack, enter upon, begin. From
  <i>attaminare</i> comes the M.&nbsp;E. <i>attame</i> or <i>atame</i>, with a
  similar sense. The metaphor is taken from the notion of cutting into a
  joint of meat or of broaching or opening a cask. This is well shewn by
  the use of the word in P. Plowman, B. xvii. 68, where it is said of the
  Good Samaritan in the parable that he 'breyde to his boteles, and bothe
  he <i>atamede</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. he went hastily to his bottles, and broached or
  opened them both. So here, the priest broached, opened, or began his
  tale.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Nonne Preestes Tale.</b></p>

  <p>We may compare Dryden's modernised version of this tale, entitled 'The
  Cock and the Fox.' See further in vol. iii. pp. 431-3.</p>

  <p>4011. <i>stape.</i> Lansd. MS. reads <i>stoupe</i>, as if it signified
  bent, <i>stooped</i>; but <i>stoop</i> is a <i>weak</i> verb.
  <i>Stape</i> or <i>stope</i> is the past participle of the strong verb
  <i>stapen</i>, to step, advance. <i>Stape in age</i> = advanced in years.
  Roger Ascham has almost the same phrase: 'And [Varro] beyng depe <i>stept
  in age</i>, by negligence some wordes do scape and fall from him in those
  bookes as be not worth the taking up,' &amp;c.&mdash;The Schoolmaster,

  <p>4018-9. <i>by housbondrye</i>, by economy; <i>fond hir-self</i>,
  'found herself,' provided for herself.</p>

  <p>4022. <i>Ful sooty was hir bour, and eek hir halle.</i> The widow's
  house consisted of only two apartments, designated by the terms bower and
  hall. Whilst the widow and her 'daughters two' slept in the bower,
  Chanticleer and his seven wives roosted on a perch in the hall, and the
  swine disposed themselves on the floor. The smoke of the fire had to find
  its way through the crevices of the roof. See Our English Home, pp. 139,
  140. Cf. Virgil, Ecl. vii. 50&mdash;'assidua postes fuligine nigri.'

  <p>4035. <i>Seynd bacoun</i>, singed or broiled bacon. <i>an ey or

  <p>4036. <i>deye.</i> The <i>daia</i> (from the Icel. <i>deigja</i>) is
  mentioned in Domesday among assistants in husbandry; and the term is
  again found in 2nd Stat. 25 Edward III (<span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  1351). In Stat. 37 Edward III (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1363), the
  <i>deye</i> is mentioned among others of a certain rank, not having goods
  or chattels of 40<i>s.</i> value. The <i>deye</i> was usually a female,
  whose duty was to make butter and cheese, attend to the calves and
  poultry, and other odds and ends of the farm. The <i>dairy</i> (in some
  parts of England, as in Shropshire, called a <i>dey</i><span
  class="nw">-house)</span> was the department assigned to her. See Prompt.
  Parv., p. 116.</p>

  <p>4039. In Caxton's translation of Reynard the Fox, the cock's name is
  <i>Chantecleer</i>. In the original, it is <i>Canticleer</i>; from his
  clear voice in singing. In the same, Reynard's second son is
  <i>Rosseel</i>; see l. 4524.</p>

  <p>4041. <i>merier</i>, sweeter, pleasanter. In Todd's Illustrations of
  Chaucer, p. 284, there is a long passage illustrative of <i>mery</i> in
  the sense of 'pleasant.' Cf. l. 4156. <i>orgon</i> is put for
  <i>orgons</i> or <i>organs</i>. It is plain from <i>gon</i> in the next
  line, that Chaucer meant to use this word as a plural from the Lat.
  <i>organa</i>. <i>Organ</i> was used until lately only in the plural,
  like <i>bellows</i>, <i>gallows</i>, &amp;c. 'Which is either sung or
  said or on the <i>organs</i> played.'&mdash;Becon's Acts of Christ, p.
  534. It was sometimes called <i>a pair of organs</i>. See note to P.
  Plowman, C. xxi. 7.</p>

  <p><i>Orloge</i> (of an abbey) occurs in Religious Pieces, ed. Perry, p.
  56; and see Stratmann.</p>

  <p>4045. 'The cock knew <i>each</i> ascension of the equinoctial, and
  crew at each; that is, he crew every hour, as 15° of the equinoctial make
  an hour. Chaucer adds [l. 4044] that he knew the hour better than the
  abbey-clock. This tells us, clearly, that we are to reckon clock-hours,
  and not the unequal hours of the solar or 'artificial' day. Hence the
  prime, mentioned in l. 4387, was at a clock-hour, at 6, 7, 8, or 9,
  suppose. The day meant is May 3, because the sun [l. 4384] had passed the
  21st degree of Taurus (see fig. 1 of Astrolabe).... The date, May 3, is
  playfully denoted by saying [l. 4379] that March was complete, and also
  (since March began) thirty-two days more had passed. The words "since
  March began" are parenthetical; and we are, in fact, told that the whole
  of March, the whole of April, and two days of May were done with. March
  was then considered the first month in the year, though the year began
  with the 25th, not with the 1st; and Chaucer alludes to the idea that the
  Creation itself took place in March. The day, then, was May 3, with the
  sun past 21 degrees of Taurus. The hour must be had from the sun's
  altitude, rightly said (l. 4389) to be <i>Fourty degrees and oon</i>. I
  use a globe, and find that the sun would attain the altitude 41° nearly
  at 9 o'clock. It follows that prime in l. 4387 signifies the end of the
  first quarter of the day, <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'reckon-' (split word at end of line not completed)."
  >reckoned</span> from 6 <span class="sm">A.M.</span> to 6 <span
  class="sm">P.M.</span>'&mdash;Skeat's Astrolabe, (E.E.T.S.), p. lxi. This
  rough test, by means of a globe, is perhaps sufficient; but Mr. Brae
  proved it to be right by calculation. Taking the sun's altitude at 41½°,
  he 'had the satisfaction to find a resulting hour, for prime, of 9
  o'clock <span class="sm">A.M.</span> <i>almost to the minute</i>.' It is
  interesting to find that Thynne explains this passage very well in his
  Animadversions on Speght's Chaucer; ed. Furnivall, p. 62, note 1.</p>

  <p>The notion that the Creation took place on the 18th of March is
  alluded to in the Hexameron of St. Basil (see the A.&nbsp;S. version, ed.
  Norman, p. 8, note <i>j</i>), and in Ælfric's Homilies, ed. Thorpe, i.
  100.</p>

  <p>4047. Fifteen degrees of the equinoctial = an exact hour. See note to
  l. 4045 above. Skelton imitates this passage in his Phillyp Sparowe, l.
  495.</p>

  <p>4050. <i>And batailed.</i> Lansd. MS. reads <i>Enbateled</i>, indented
  like a battlement, embattled. <i>Batailed</i> has the same sense.</p>

  <p>4051. <i>as the Ieet</i>, like the jet. Beads used for the repetition
  of prayers were frequently formed of <i>jet</i>. See note to Prol. A.

  'Anxious black melancholy <i>fumes</i>.'&mdash;Burton's Anat. of Mel. p.
  438, ed. 1845. 'All vapours arising out of the stomach,' especially those
  caused by gluttony and drunkenness. 'For when the head is heated it
  scorcheth the blood, and from thence proceed melancholy <i>fumes</i> that
  trouble the mind.'&mdash;Ibid. p. 269.</p>

  <p>4118. <i>rede colera</i> ... red cholera caused by too much bile and
  <i>blood</i> (sometimes called <i>red humour</i>). Burton speaks of a
  kind of melancholy of which the signs are these&mdash;'the veins of their
  eyes red, as well as their faces.' The following quotation explains the
  matter. 'Ther be foure humours, Bloud, Fleame, Cholar, and Melancholy....
  First, working heate turneth what is colde and moyst into the kind of
  Fleme, and then what is hot and moyst, into the kinde of Bloud; and then
  what is hot and drye into the kinde of Cholera; and then what is colde
  and drye into the kinde of Melancholia.... By meddling of other humours,
  Bloud chaungeth kinde and colour: for by meddling of <i>Cholar</i>, it
  seemeth <i>red</i>, and by Melancholy it seemeth <i>black</i>, and by
  Fleame it seemeth watrie, and fomie.'&mdash;Batman upon Bartholomè, lib.
  iv. c. 6. So also&mdash;'in bloud it needeth that there be <i>red
  Cholera</i>'; lib. iv. c. 10; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The following explains the belief as to dreams caused by
  <i>cholera</i>. Men in which red <i>Cholera</i> is excesssive 'dreame of
  fire, and of lyghtening, and of dreadful burning of the ayre'; Batman
  upon Bartholomè, lib. iv. c. 10. Those in which <i>Melancholia</i> is
  excessive dream 'dredfull darke dreames, and very ill to see'; id. c. 11.
  And again: 'He that is Sanguine hath glad and liking dreames, the
  melancholious dremeth of sorrow, the Cholarike, of <i>firy</i> things,
  and the Flematike, of Raine, Snow,' &amp;c.; id. lib. vi. c. 27.</p>

  quoted by John of Salisbury, Polycrat. l. ii. c. 16, as a precept <i>viri

  <p>4155. <i>catapuce</i>, caper-spurge, <i>Euphorbia Lathyris</i>.
  <i>gaytres</i> (or <i>gaytrys</i>) <i>beryis</i>, probably the berries of
  the buck-thorn, <i>Rhamnus catharticus</i>; which (according to Rietz) is
  still called, in Swedish dialects, the <i>getbärs-trä</i> (goat-berries
  tree) or <i>getappel</i> (goat-apple). I take <i>gaytre</i> to stand for
  <i>gayt-tre</i>, i.&nbsp;e. goat-tree; a Northern form, from Icel. <i>geit</i>
  (gen. <i>geitar</i>), a goat. The A.&nbsp;S. <i>g&#x101;te-tr&#x113;ow</i>,
  goat-tree, is probably the same tree, though the prov. Eng.
  <i>gaiter-tree</i>, <i>gatten-tree</i>, or <i>gatteridge-tree</i> is
  usually applied to the <i>Cornus sanguinea</i> or cornel-tree, the fruits
  of which 'are sometimes mistaken for those of the buck-thorn, but do not
  possess the active properties of that plant'; Eng. Cyclop., s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>Cornus</i>. The context shews that the buck-thorn is meant. Langham
  says of the buck-thorn, that 'the beries do purge downwards mightily
  flegme and choller'; Garden of Health, 1633, p. 99 (New E. Dict., s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>Buckthorn</i>). This is why Chanticleer was recommended to eat
  them.</p>

  <p>4156. <i>erbe yve</i>, herb ive or herb ivy, usually identified with
  the ground-pine, <i>Ajuga chamæpitys</i>. <i>mery</i>, pleasant, used
  ironically; as the leaves are extremely nauseous. <!-- Page 253 --><span

  <p>4174. <i>Oon of the gretteste auctours.</i> 'Cicero, De Divin. l. i.
  c. 27, relates this and the following story, but in a different order,
  and with so many other differences, that one might be led to suspect that
  he was here quoted at second-hand, if it were not usual with Chaucer, in
  these stories of familiar life, to throw in a number of natural
  circumstances, not to be found in his original authors.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt.
  Warton thinks that Chaucer took it rather from Valerius Maximus, who has
  the same story; i. 7. He has, however, overlooked the statement in l.
  4254, which decides for Cicero. I here quote the whole of the former
  story, as given by Valerius. 'Duo familiares Arcades iter una facientes,
  Megaram venerunt; quorum alter ad hospitem se contulit, alter in tabernam

  Mercians in 821 [Haydn, Book of Dates, says 819] at the age of seven
  years, and was murdered by order of his aunt, Quenedreda. He was
  subsequently made a saint, and his legend will be found in Capgrave, or
  in the Golden Legend.'&mdash;Wright.</p>

  <p>St. Kenelm's day is Dec. 13. Alban Butler, in his Lives of the Saints,
  says:&mdash;[Kenulph] 'dying in 819, left his son Kenelm, a child only
  seven years old [see l. 4307] heir to his crown, under the tutelage of
  his sister Quindride. This ambitious woman committed his person to the
  care of one Ascobert, whom she had hired to make away with him. The
  wicked minister decoyed the innocent child into an unfrequented wood, cut
  off his head, and buried him under a thorn-tree. His corpse is said to
  have been discovered by a heavenly ray of light which shone over the
  place, and by the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>In Clent cow-pasture, under a thorn,</p>
      <p>Of head bereft, lies Kenelm, king born.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Milton tells the story in his History of Britain, bk. iv. ed. 1695, p.
  218, and refers us to Matthew of Westminster. He adds that the
  'inscription' was inside a note, which was miraculously dropped by a dove
  on the altar at Rome. Our great poet's verson of it is:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Low in a Mead of Kine, under a thorn,</p>
      <p>Of Head bereft, li'th poor <i>Kenelm</i> King-born.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Clent is near the boundary between Staffordshire and
  Worcestershire.</p>

  <p>Neither of these accounts mentions Kenelm's dream, but it is given in
  his Life, as printed in Early Eng. Poems, ed. Furnivall (Phil. Soc.
  1862), p. 51, and in Caxton's Golden Legend. St. Kenelm dreamt that he
  saw a noble tree with waxlights upon it, and that he climbed to the top
  of it; whereupon one of his best friends cut it down, and he was turned
  into a little bird, and flew up to heaven. The little bird denoted his
  soul, and the flight to heaven his death.</p>

  he seems to have caught the right idea. <i>Col-</i> here represents M.&nbsp;E.
  <i>col</i>, coal; and the reference is to the <i>brant-fox</i>, which is
  explained in the New E. Dict. as borrowed from the G. <i>brand-fuchs</i>,
  'the German name of a variety of the fox, chiefly distinguished by a
  greater admixture of black in its fur; according to Grimm, it has black
  feet, ears, and tail.' Chaucer expressly refers to the black-tipped tail
  and ears in l. 4094 above. Mr. Bradley cites the G. <i>kohlfuchs</i> and
  Du. <i>koolvos</i>, similarly formed; but the ordinary dictionaries do
  not give these names. The old explanation of <i>col-fox</i> as meaning
  'deceitful fox' is difficult to establish, and is now unnecessary.</p>

  is merely quoting Chaucer. To cry <i>cok! cok!</i> refers rather to the

  <i>brunell</i>, from its <i>brown</i> colour; as the <i>fox</i> below is
  called <i>Russel</i>, from his <i>red</i> colour.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. The
  Latin story is printed in The Anglo-Latin Satirists of the Twelfth
  Century, ed. T. Wright, i. 55; see also Wright's Biographia Britannica
  Literaria, Anglo-Norman Period, p. 356. There is an amusing translation
  of it in Lowland Scotch, printed as 'The Unicornis Tale' in Small's
  edition of Laing's Select Remains of Scotch Poetry, ed. 1885, p. 285. It
  tells how a certain young Gundulfus broke a cock's leg by throwing a
  stone at him. On the morning of the day when Gundulfus was to be ordained
  and to receive a benefice, the cock took his revenge by not crowing till
  much later <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>4649. <i>brasil</i>, a wood used for dyeing of a <i>bright red</i>
  colour; hence the allusion. It is mentioned as being used for dyeing
  leather in Riley's Memorials of London, p. 364. '<i>Brazil-wood</i>; this
  name is now applied in trade to the dye-wood imported from Pernambuco,
  which is derived from certain species of <i>Cæsalpinia</i> indigenous
  there. But it originally applied to a dye-wood of the same genus which
  was imported from India, and which is now known in trade as
  <i>Sappan</i>. The history of the word is very curious. For when the name
  was applied to the newly discovered region in S. America, probably, as
  Barros alleges, because it produced a dye-wood similar in character to
  the <i>brazil</i> of the East, the trade-name gradually became
  appropriated to the S. American product, and was taken away from that of
  the E. Indies. See some further remarks in Marco Polo, ed. Yule, 2nd ed.
  ii. 368-370.</p>

  <p>'This is alluded to also by Camo&#x1EBD;s (Lusiad, x. 140). Burton's

  <p>'The medieval forms of <i>brazil</i> were many; in Italian, it is
  generally <i>verzi</i>, <i>verzino</i>, or the like.'&mdash;Yule,
  Hobson-Jobson, p. 86.</p>

  <p>Again&mdash;'<i>Sappan</i>, the wood of <i>Cæsalpinia sappan</i>; the
  <i>baqqam</i> of the Arabs, and the Brazil-wood of medieval commerce. The
  tree appears to be indigenous in Malabar, the Deccan, and the Malay
  peninsula.'&mdash;id. p. 600. And in Yule's edition of Marco Polo, ii.
  315, he tells us that 'it is extensively used by native dyers, chiefly
  for common and cheap <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page259"></a>[259]</span>cloths, and for fine mats. The dye is
  precipitated dark-brown with iron, and red with alum.'</p>

  <p>Cf. Way's note on the word in the Prompt. Parv. p. 47.</p>

  <p>Florio explains Ital. <i>verzino</i> as 'brazell woode, or fernanbucke
  [Pernambuco] to dye red withall.'</p>

  <p>The etymology is disputed, but I think <i>brasil</i> and Ital.
  <i>verzino</i> are alike due to the Pers. <i>wars</i>, saffron; cf. Arab.
  <i>war&#x12B;s</i>, dyed with saffron or <i>wars</i>.</p>

  <p><i>greyn of Portingale.</i> <i>Greyn</i>, mod. E. <i>grain</i>, is the
  term applied to the dye produced by the coccus insect, often termed, in
  commerce and the arts, <i>kermes</i>; see Marsh, Lectures on the E.
  Language, Lect. III. The colour thus produced was 'fast,' i.&nbsp;e. would not
  wash out; hence the phrase to <i>engrain</i>, or to <i>dye in grain</i>,
  meaning to dye of a fast colour. Various tones of red were thus produced,
  one of which was <i>crimson</i>, and another <i>carmine</i>, both forms
  being derivatives of <i>kermes</i>. <i>Of Portingale</i> means 'imported
  from Portugal.' In the Libell of English Policy, cap. ii. (l. 132), it is
  said that, among 'the commoditees of <i>Portingale</i>' are:&mdash;'oyl,
  wyn, osey [Alsace wine], wex, and <i>graine</i>.'</p>

  <p>4652. <i>to another</i>, to another of the pilgrims. This is so
  absurdly indefinite that it can hardly be genuine. Ll. 4637-4649 are in
  Chaucer's most characteristic manner, and are obviously genuine; but
  there, I suspect, we must stop, viz. at the word <i>Portingale</i>. The
  next three lines form a mere stop-gap, and are either spurious, or were
  jotted down temporarily, to await the time of revision. The former is
  more probable.</p>

  <p>This Epilogue is only found in three MSS.; (see footnote, p. 289). In
  Dd., Group G follows, beginning with the Second Nun's Tale. In the other
  two MSS., Group H follows, i.&nbsp;e. the Manciple's Tale; nevertheless, MS.
  Addit. absurdly puts <i>the Nunne</i>, in place of <i>another</i>. The
  net result is, that, at this place, the gap is <i>complete</i>; with no
  hint as to what Tale should follow.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that this Epilogue is preserved in Thynne and the
  old black-letter editions, in which it is followed immediately by the
  Manciple's Prologue. This arrangement is obviously wrong, because that
  Prologue is not introduced by the Host (as said in l. 4652).</p>

  <p>In l. 4650, Thynne has <i>But</i> for <i>Now</i>; and his last line
  runs&mdash;'Sayd to a nother man, as ye shal here.' I adopt his reading
  of <i>to</i> for <i>unto</i> (as in the MSS.).</p>

<p class="ac lg125">NOTES TO GROUP C.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Phisiciens Tale.</b></p>

  <p>For remarks on the spurious Prologues to this Tale, see vol. iii. p.
  434. For further remarks on the Tale, see the same, p. 435, where its
  original is printed in full.</p>

  <p>1. The story is told by Livy, lib. iii.; and, of course, his narrative
  is the source of all the rest. But Tyrwhitt well remarks, in a note to l.
  12074 (i.&nbsp;e. C. 140):&mdash;'In the Discourse, &amp;c., I forgot to
  mention the Roman de la Rose as one of the sources of this tale; though,
  upon examination, I find that our author has drawn more from thence, than
  from either Gower or Livy.' It is absurd to argue, as in Bell's Chaucer,
  that our poet must necessarily have known Livy 'in the original,' and
  then to draw the conclusion that we must look to Livy only as the true
  source of the Tale. For it is perfectly obvious that Tyrwhitt is right as
  regards the Roman de la Rose; and the belief that Chaucer may have read
  the tale 'in the original' does not alter <i>the fact</i> that he trusted
  much more to the French text. In this very first line, he is merely
  quoting Le Roman, ll. 5617, 8:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Qui fu fille Virginius,</p>
      <p><i>Si cum dist Titus Livius</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The story in the French text occupies 70 lines (5613-5682, ed. Méon);
  the chief points of resemblance are noted below.</p>

  <p>Gower has the same story, Conf. Amant. iii. 264-270; but I see no
  reason why Chaucer should be considered as indebted to him. It is,
  however, clear that, if Chaucer and Gower be here compared, the latter
  suffers considerably by the comparison.</p>

  <p>Gower gives the names of Icilius, to whom Virginia was betrothed, and
  of Marcus Claudius. But Chaucer omits the name Marcus, and ignores the
  existence of Icilius. The French text does the same.</p>

  <p>11. This is the 'noble goddesse Nature' mentioned in the Parl. of
  Foules, ll. 368, 379. Cf. note to l. 16.</p>

  <p>14. <i>Pigmalion</i>, Pygmalion; alluding to Ovid, Met. x. 247, where
  it is said of him:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Interea niueum mira feliciter arte</p>
      <p>Sculpit ebur, formamque dedit, qua femina nasci</p>
      <p>Nulla potest; operisque sui concepit amorem.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 261 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>[261]</span></p>

  <p>In the margin of E. Hn. is the note&mdash;'Quere in Methamorphosios';
  which supplies the reference; but cf. note to l. 16 below, shewing that
  Chaucer also had in his mind Le Roman de la Rose, l. 16379. So also the
  author of the Pearl, l. 750; see Morris, Allit. Poems.</p>

  <p>16. In the margin of E. Hn. we find the note:&mdash;'Apelles fecit
  mirabile opus in tumulo Darii; vide in Alexandri libro .1.º [Hn.
  <i>has</i> .6.º]; de Zanze in libro Tullii.' This note is doubtless the
  poet's own; see further, as to Apelles, in the note to D. 498.</p>

  <p><i>Zanzis</i>, Zeuxis. The corruption of the name was easy, owing to
  the confusion in MSS. between <i>n</i> and <i>u</i>.<a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> In the note above, we are referred to
  Tullius, i.&nbsp;e. Cicero. Dr. Reid kindly tells me that Zeuxis is mentioned,
  with Apelles, in Cicero's De Oratore, iii. § 26, and Brutus, § 70; also,
  with other artists, in Academia, ii. § 146; De Finibus, ii. § 115; and
  alone, in De Inventione, ii. § 52, where a long story is told of him. Cf.
  note to Troil. iv. 414.</p>

  <p>However, the fact is that Chaucer really derived his knowledge of
  Zeuxis from Le Roman de la Rose (ed. Méon, l. 16387); for comparison with
  the context of that line shews numerous points of resemblance to the
  present passage in our author. Jean de Meun is there speaking of Nature,
  and of the inability of artists to vie with her, which is precisely
  Chaucer's argument here. The passage is too long for quotation, but I may
  cite such lines as these:&mdash;</p>

  <p>32-4. Cf. Le Rom. de la Rose, 16443-6.</p>

  <p>35. From this line to l. 120, Chaucer has it all his own way. This
  fine passage is not in Le Roman, nor in Gower.</p>

  <p>37. I.&nbsp;e. she had golden hair; cf. Troil. iv. 736, v. 8.</p>

      <p>Quem docuit, multaque insignem reddidit arte.'</p>

  <p>50. <i>fácound</i>, eloquence; cf. <i>facóunde</i> in Parl. Foules,
  558.</p>

  <p>54. <i>Souninge in</i>, conducing to; see A. 307, B. 3157, and
  notes.</p>

  <p>58. <i>Bacus</i>, Bacchus, i.&nbsp;e. wine; see next note.</p>

  <p>59. <i>youthe</i>, youth; such is the reading in MSS. E. Hn., and edd.
  1532 and 1561. MS. Cm. has lost a leaf; the rest have <i>thought</i>,
  which gives no sense. It is clear that the reading <i>thought</i> arose
  from misreading the <i>y</i> of <i>youthe</i> as <i>þ</i> (<i>th</i>).
  How easily this may be done appears from Wright's remark, that the
  Lansdowne MS. has <i>youthe</i>, whilst, in fact, it has
  <i>þouht</i>.</p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt objects to the reading <i>youthe</i>, and proposes
  <i>slouthe</i>, wholly without authority. But <i>youthe</i>, meaning
  'youthful vigour,' is right enough; I see no objection to it at all.
  Rather, it is simply taken from Ovid, Ars Amat. i. 243:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Only a few lines above (l. 232), <i>Bacchus</i> occurs, and there is a
  reference to <i>wine</i>, throughout the context. Cf. the Romaunt of the
  Rose, l. 4925:&mdash;</p>

  <p>60. Alluding to a proverbial phrase, occurring in Horace, Sat. ii. 3.
  321, viz. 'oleum adde camino'; and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>65. This probably refers to the same passage in Ovid as is mentioned
  in the note to l. 59. For we there find (l. 229):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Dant etiam positis aditum conuiuia mensis;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>79. See A. 476, and the note. Chaucer is here thinking of the same
  passage in Le Roman de la Rose. I quote a few lines (3930-46):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  </div>

  <p>See the English version in vol. i. p. 205, ll. 4285-4300.</p>

  <p>82. See the footnote for another reading. The line there given may
  also be genuine. It is deficient in the first foot.</p>

  <p>85. This is like our proverb:&mdash;'Set a thief to catch [<i>or</i>
  take] a thief.' An old poacher makes a good gamekeeper.</p>

  <p>98. Cf. Prov. xiii. 24; P. Plowman, B. v. 41.</p>

  <p>101. See a similar proverb in P. Plowman, C. x. 265, and my note on
  the line. The Latin lines quoted in P. Plowman are from Alanus de
  Insulis, Liber Parabolarum, cap. i. 31; they are printed in Leyser, Hist.
  Poet. Med. Aevi, 1721, p. 1066, in the following form:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Sub molli pastore capit lanam lupus, et grex</p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.9em">Incustoditus dilaceratur eo.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>117. <i>The doctour</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the teacher; viz. St. Augustine. (There
  is here no reference whatever to the 'Doctor' or 'Phisicien' who is
  supposed to tell the tale.) In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. is written
  'Augustinus'; and the matter is put beyond doubt by a passage in the
  Persones Tale, l. 484:&mdash;'and, after the word of seint Augustin, it
  [Envye] is sorwe of other mannes wele, and Ioye of othere mennes harm.'
  See note to l. 484.</p>

  <p>The same idea is exactly reproduced in P. Plowman, B. v. 112, 113. Cf.
  'Inuidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis'; Horace, Epist. i. 2. 57.</p>

  <p>135. From Le Roman, l. 5620-3; see vol. iii. p. 436.</p>

  <p>140. <i>cherl</i>, dependant. It is remarkable that, throughout the
  story, MSS. E. Hn. and Cm. have <i>cherl</i>, but the rest have
  <i>clerk</i>. In ll. 140, 142, 153, 164, the Camb. MS. is deficient; but
  it at once gives the reading <i>cherl</i> in l. 191, and
  subsequently.</p>

  <p>Either reading might serve; in Le Roman, l. 5614, the dependant is
  called 'son serjant'; and in l. 5623, he is called 'Li <i>ribaus</i>,'
  i.&nbsp;e. the ribald, which Chaucer Englishes by <i>cherl</i>. But when we
  come to C. 289, the MSS. gives us the choice of 'fals <i>cherl</i>' and
  'cursed <i>theef</i>'; very few have <i>clerk</i> (like MS. Sloane 1685).
  Cf. vol. iii. p. 437.</p>

  <p>153, 154. The 'churl's' name was Marcus Claudius, and the 'judge' was
  'Appius Claudius.' Chaucer simply follows Jean de Meun, who calls the
  judge <i>Apius</i>; and speaks of the churl as '<i>Claudius</i> li
  chalangieres' in l. 5675. <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264"></a>[264]</span></p>

  <p>165. Cf. Le Roman, l. 5623-7; see vol. iii. p. 436.</p>

  <p>168-9. From Le Roman, 5636-8, as above.</p>

  <p>174. The first foot is defective; read&mdash;Thou | shalt have | al,
  &amp;c. <i>al right</i>, complete justice. MS. Cm. has <i>alle</i>.</p>

  <p>184. Cf. Le Roman, l. 5628-33.</p>

  <p>203. From Le Roman, 5648-54.</p>

  <p>207-253. The whole of this fine passage appears to be original. There
  is no hint of it in Le Roman de la Rose, except as regards l. 225, where
  Le Roman (l. 5659) has:&mdash;'Car il par amors, sans haïne.' We may
  compare the farewell speech of Virginius to his daughter in Webster's
  play of Appius and Virginia, Act iv. sc. 1.</p>

  <p>240. <i>Iepte</i>, Jephtha; in the Vulgate, <i>Jephte</i>. See Judges,
  xi. 37, 38. MSS. E. Hn. have in the margin&mdash;'fuit illo tempore
  Jephte Galaandes' [<i>error for</i> Galaadites]. This reference by
  Virginia to the book of Judges is rather startling; but such things are
  common enough in old authors, especially in our dramatists.</p>

  <p>255. Here Chaucer returns to Le Roman, 5660-82. The rendering is
  pretty close down to l. 276.</p>

  <p>280. <i>Agryse of</i>, shudder at; 'nor in what kind of way the worm
  of conscience may shudder because of (the man's) wicked life'; cf. 'of
  pitee gan agryse,' B. 614. When <i>agryse</i> is used with <i>of</i>, it
  is commonly passive, not intransitive; see examples in Mätzner and in the
  New E. Dictionary. Cf. <i>been afered</i>, i.&nbsp;e. be scared, in l.
  284.</p>

  <p>'Vermis conscientiae tripliciter lacerabit'; Innocent III., De
  Contemptu Mundi, l. iii. c. 2.</p>

  <p>286. Cf. Pers. Tale, I. 93:&mdash;'repentant folk, that stinte for to
  sinne, and forlete [give up] sinne er that sinne forlete hem.'</p>

<p class="ac"><b>Words of the Host.</b></p>

  <p>In the Six-text Edition, pref. col. 58, Dr. Furnivall calls attention
  to the curious variations in this passage, in the MSS., especially in ll.
  289-292, and in 297-300; as well as in ll. 487, 488 in the Pardoneres
  Tale. I note these variations below, in their due places.</p>

  <p>287. <i>wood</i>, mad, frantic, furious; esp. applied to the transient
  madness of anger. See Kn. Tale, A. 1301, 1329, 1578; also Mids. Nt. Dr.
  ii. 1. 192. Cf. G. <i>wüthend</i>, raging.</p>

  <p>288. <i>Harrow!</i> also spelt <i>haro</i>; a cry of astonishment; see
  A. 3286, 3825, B. 4235, &amp;c. '<i>Haro</i>, the ancient Norman hue and
  cry; the exclamation of a person to procure assistance when his person or
  property was in danger. To cry out <i>haro</i> on any one, to denounce
  his evil doings'; Halliwell. Spenser has it, F.&nbsp;Q. ii. 6. 43; see
  <i>Harrow</i> in Nares, and the note above, to A. 3286.</p>

  <p>On the oaths used by the Host, see note to l. 651 below.</p>

  <p>289. <i>fals cherl</i> is the reading in E. Hn., and is evidently
  right; see <!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page265"></a>[265]</span>note to l. 140 above. It is supported by
  several MSS., among which are Harl. 7335, Addit. 25718, Addit. 5140,
  Sloane 1686, Barlow 20, Hatton 1, Camb. Univ. Lib. Dd. 4. 24 and Mm. 2.
  5, and Trin. Coll. Cam. R. 3. 3. A few have <i>fals clerk</i>, viz.
  Sloane 1685, Arch. Seld. B. 14, Rawl. Poet. 149, Bodley 414. Harl. 7333
  has <i>a fals thef, Acursid Iustise</i>; out of which numerous MSS. have
  developed the reading <i>a cursed theef, a fals Iustice</i>, which rolls
  the two Claudii into one. It is clearly wrong, but appears in good MSS.,
  viz. in Cp. Pt. Ln. Hl. See vol. iii. pp. 437-8, and the note to l. 291
  below.</p>

  <p>290. <i>shamful.</i> MSS. Ln. Hl. turn this into <i>schendful</i>,
  i.&nbsp;e. ignominious, which does not at all alter the sense. It is a matter
  of small moment, but I may note that of the twenty-five MSS. examined by
  Dr. Furnivall, only the two above-named MSS. adopt this variation.</p>

  <p>291, 292. Here MSS. Cp. Ln. Hl., as noted in the footnote, have two
  totally different lines; and this curious variation divides the MSS. (at
  least in the present passage) into two sets. In the <i>first</i> of these
  we find E. Hn. Harl. 7335, Addit. 25718, Addit. 5140, Sloane 1685 and
  1686, Barlow 20, Arch. Seld. B. 14, Rawl. Poet. 149, Hatton 1, Bodley
  414, Camb. Dd. 4. 24, and Mm. 2. 5, Trin. Coll. Cam. R. 3. 3. In the
  <i>second</i> set we find Cp. Ln. Hl., Harl. 1758, Royal 18. C. 2, Laud
  739, Camb. Ii. 3. 26, Royal 17. D. 15, and Harl. 7333.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt as to the correct reading; for the 'false cherl' and
  'false justice' were two different persons, and it was only because they
  had been inadvertently rolled into one (see note to l. 289) that it
  became possible to speak of '<i>his</i> body,' '<i>his</i> bones,' and
  '<i>him</i>.' Hence the lines are rightly given in the text which I have
  adopted.</p>

  <p>There is a slight difficulty, however, in the rime, which should be
  noted. We see that the <i>t</i> in <i>advocats</i> was silent, and that
  the word was pronounced (ad·vokaa·s), riming with <i>allas</i> (alaa·s),
  where the raised dot denotes the accent. That this was so, is indicated
  by the following spellings:&mdash;Pt. <i>aduocas</i>, and so also in
  Harl. 7335, Addit. 5140, Bodl. 414; Rawl. Poet. 149 has <i>advocas</i>;
  whilst Sloane 1685, Sloane 1686, and Camb. Mm. 2. 5 have <i>aduocase</i>,
  and Barlow 20, <i>advocase</i>. MS. Trin. Coll. R. 3. 3 has
  <i>aduocasse</i>. The testimony of ten MSS. may suffice; but it is worth
  noting that the F. pl. <i>aduocas</i> occurs in Le Roman de la Rose,
  5107.</p>

  <p>293. 'Alas! she (Virginia) bought her beauty too dear'; she paid too
  high a price; it cost her her life.</p>

  <p>297-300. These four lines are genuine; but several MSS., including E.
  Hn. Pt., omit the former pair (297-8), whilst several others omit the
  latter pair. Ed. 1532 contains both pairs, but alters l. 299.</p>

  <p>299. <i>bothe yiftes</i>, both (kinds of) gifts; i.&nbsp;e. gifts of
  fortune, such as wealth, and of nature, such as beauty. Compare Dr.
  Johnson's poem on the Vanity of Human Wishes, imitated from the tenth
  satire of Juvenal.</p>

  <p>303. <i>is no fors</i>, it is no matter. <i>It</i> must be supplied,
  for the sense. <!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>[266]</span>Sometimes Chaucer omits <i>it is</i>, and
  simply writes <i>no fors</i>, as in E. 1092, 2430. We also find <i>I do
  no fors</i>, I care not, D. 1234; and <i>They yeve no fors</i>, they care
  not, Romaunt of the Rose, 4826. Palsgrave has&mdash;'I gyue no force, I
  care nat for a thing, <i>Il ne men chault</i>.'</p>

  <p>306. <i>Ypocras</i> is the usual spelling, in English MSS., of
  <i>Hippocrates</i>; see Prologue A. 431. So also in the Book of the
  Duchess, 571, 572:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Ne hele me may physicien,</p>
      <p>Noght Ypocras, ne Galien.'</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the present passage it does not signify the physician himself, but
  a beverage named after him. 'It was composed of wine, with spices and
  sugar, strained through a cloth. It is said to have taken its name from
  <i><span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Hippocates'."
  >Hippocrates</span>' sleeve</i>, the term apothecaries gave to a
  strainer'; Halliwell's Dict. s.&nbsp;v. <i>Hippocras</i>. In the same work,
  s.&nbsp;v. <i>Ipocras</i>, are several receipts for making it, the simplest
  being one copied from Arnold's Chronicle:&mdash;'Take a quart of red
  wyne, an ounce of synamon, and half an unce of gynger; a quarter of an
  ounce of greynes, and long peper, and halfe a pounde of sugar; and brose
  all this, and than put them in a bage of wullen clothe, made therefore,
  with the wyne; and lete it hange over a vessel, tyll the wyne be rune
  thorowe.' Halliwell adds that&mdash;'Ipocras seems to have been a great
  favourite with our ancestors, being served up at every entertainment,
  public or private. It generally made a part of the last course, and was
  taken immediately after dinner, with wafers or some other light
  biscuits'; &amp;c. See Pegge's Form of Cury, p. 161; Babees Book, ed.
  Furnivall, pp. 125-128, 267, 378; Skelton, ed. Dyce, ii. 285; and Nares's
  Glossary, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Hippocras</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Galianes.</i> In like manner this word (hitherto unexplained as far
  as I am aware) must signify drinks named after Galen, whose name is spelt
  <i>Galien</i> (in Latin, <i>Galienus</i>) not only in Chaucer, but in
  other authors. See the quotation above from the Book of the Duchess.
  Speght guessed the word to mean 'Galen's works.'</p>

  <p>310. <i>lyk a prelat</i>, like a dignitary of the church, like a
  bishop or abbot. Mr. Jephson, in Bell's edition, suggests that the Doctor
  was in holy orders, and that this is why we are told in the Prologue, l.
  438, that 'his studie was but litel on the bible.' I see no reason for
  this guess, which is quite unsupported. Chaucer does not say he <i>is</i>
  a prelate, but that he is <i>like</i> one; because he had been highly
  educated, as a member of a 'learned profession' should be.</p>

  <p><i>Ronyan</i> is here of three syllables and rimes with <i>man</i>; in
  l. 320 it is of two syllables, and rimes with <i>anon</i>. It looks as if
  the Host and Pardoner were not very clear about the saint's name, only
  knowing him to swear by. In Pilkington's Works (Parker Society), we find
  a mention of 'St. Tronian's fast,' p. 80; and again, of 'St. Rinian's
  fast,' p. 551, in a passage which is a repetition of the former. The
  forms <i>Ronyan</i> and <i>Rinian</i> are evidently corruptions of
  <i>Ronan</i>, a saint whose <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>[267]</span>name is well known to readers of 'St.
  Ronan's Well.' Of St. Ronan scarcely anything is known. The fullest
  account that can easily be found is the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Ronan, B. and C. Feb. 7.&mdash;Beyond the mere mention of his
  commemoration as S. Ronan, bishop at Kilmaronen, in Levenax, in the body
  of the Breviary of Aberdeen, there is nothing said about this saint....
  Camerarius (p. 86) makes this Ronanus the same as he who is mentioned by
  Beda (Hist. Ecc. lib. iii. c. 25). This Ronan died in <span class="sm">A.
  D.</span> 778. The Ulster annals give at [<span class="sm">A. D.</span>]
  737 (736)&mdash;"Mors Ronain Abbatis Cinngaraid." Ængus places this saint
  at the 9th of February,' &amp;c.; Kalendars of Scottish Saints, by Bp. A.
  P. Forbes, 1872, p. 441. Kilmaronen is Kilmaronock, in the county and
  parish of Dumbarton. There are traces of St. Ronan in about seven
  place-names in Scotland, according to the same authority. Under the date
  of Feb. 7 (February vol. ii. 3 B), the Acta Sanctorum has a few lines
  about St. Ronan, who, according to some, flourished under King Malduin,
  <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 664-684; or, according to others, about
  603. The notice concludes with the remark&mdash;'Maiorem lucem
  desideramus.' Beda says that 'Ronan, a Scot by nation, but instructed in
  ecclesiastical truth either in France or Italy,' was mixed up in the
  controversy which arose about the keeping of Easter, and was 'a most
  zealous defender of the true Easter.' This controversy took place about
  <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 652, which does not agree with the date
  above.</p>

  <p>311. Tyrwhitt thinks that Shakespeare remembered this expression of
  Chaucer, when he describes the Host of the Garter as frequently repeating
  the phrase 'said I well': Merry Wives of Windsor, i. 3. 11; ii. 1. 226;
  ii. 3. 93, 99.</p>

  <p><i>in terme</i>, in learned terms; cf. Prol. A. 323.</p>

  <p>312. <i>erme</i>, to grieve. For the explanation of unusual
  <i>words</i>, the Glossary should, in general, be consulted; the Notes
  are intended, for the most part, to explain only phrases and allusions,
  and to give illustrations of the <i>use</i> of words. Such illustrations
  are, moreover, often omitted when they can easily be found by consulting
  such a work as Stratmann's Old English Dictionary. In the present case,
  for example, Stratmann gives twelve instances of the use of <i>earm</i>
  or <i>arm</i> as an adjective, meaning wretched; four examples of
  <i>ermlic</i>, miserable; seven of <i>earming</i>, a miserable creature;
  and five of <i>earmthe</i>, misery. These twenty-eight additional
  examples shew that the word was formerly well understood. We may further
  note that a later instance of <i>ermen</i> or <i>erme</i>, to grieve,
  occurs in Caxton's translation of Reynard the Fox, <span class="sm">A.
  D.</span> 1481; see Arber's reprint, p. 48, l. 5: 'Thenne departed he fro
  the kynge so heuyly that many of them <i>ermed</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. then departed
  he from the king so sorrowfully that many of them mourned, or were
  greatly grieved.</p>

  <p>313. <i>cardiacle</i>, pain about the heart, spasm of the heart; more
  correctly, <i>cardiake</i>, as the <i>l</i> is excrescent. See
  <i>Cardiacle</i> and <i>Cardiac</i> in the New E. Dictionary. In Batman
  upon Bartholomè, lib. vii. c. 32, <!-- Page 268 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>[268]</span>we have a description
  of 'Heart-quaking and the disease Cardiacle.' We thus learn that 'there
  is a double manner of Cardiacle,' called 'Diaforetica' and 'Tremens.' Of
  the latter, 'sometime <i>melancholy is the cause</i>'; and the remedies
  are various 'confortatives.' This is why the host wanted some 'triacle'
  or some ale, or something to cheer him up.</p>

  <p>314. The Host's form of oath is amusingly ignorant; he is confusing
  the two oaths 'by corpus Domini' and 'by Christes bones,' and evidently
  regards <i>corpus</i> as a genitive case. Tyrwhitt alters the phrase to
  'By corpus domini,' which wholly spoils the humour of it.</p>

  <p><i>triacle</i>, a restorative remedy; see Man of Lawes Tale, B.
  479.</p>

  <p>315. <i>moyste</i>, new. The word retains the sense of the Lat.
  <i>musteus</i> and <i>mustus</i>. In Group H. 60, we find <i>moysty
  ale</i> spoken of as differing from <i>old ale</i>. But the most peculiar
  use of the word is in the Prologue, A. 457, where the Wyf of Bath's shoes
  are described as being <i>moyste and newe</i>.</p>

  <p><i>corny</i>, strong of the corn or malt; cf. l. 456. Skelton calls it
  'newe ale in cornys'; Magnificence, 782; or 'in cornes,' Elynour Rummyng,
  378. Baret's Alvearie, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Ale</i>, has: 'new ale in cornes,
  ceruisia cum recrementis.' It would seem that ale was thought the better
  for having dregs of malt in it.</p>

  <p>318. <i>bel amy</i>, good friend; a common form of address in old
  French. We also find <i>biaus douz amis</i>, sweet good friend; as
  in&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Belamy</i> occurs in an Early Eng. Life of St. Cecilia, MS. Ashmole
  43, l. 161; and six other examples are given in the New Eng. Dictionary.
  Similar forms are <i>beau filtz</i>, dear son, Piers Plowman, B. vii.
  162; <i>beau pere</i>, good father; <i>beau sire</i>, good sir. Cf.
  <i>beldame</i>.</p>

  <p>321. <i>ale-stake</i>, inn-sign. Speght interprets this by 'may-pole.'
  He was probably thinking of the <i>ale-pole</i>, such as was sometimes
  set up before an inn as a sign; see the picture of one in Larwood and
  Hotten's History of Signboards, Plate II. But the <i>ale-stakes</i> of
  the fourteenth century were differently placed; instead of being
  perpendicular, they projected horizontally from the inn, just like the
  bar which supports a painted sign at the present day. At the end of the
  ale-stake a large garland was commonly suspended, as mentioned by Chaucer
  himself (Prol. 667), or sometimes a bunch of ivy, box, or evergreen,
  called a 'bush'; whence the proverb 'good wine needs no <i>bush</i>,'
  i.&nbsp;e. nothing to indicate where it is sold; see Hist. Signboards, pp. 2,
  4, 6, 233. The clearest information about ale-stakes is obtained from a
  notice of them in the Liber Albus, ed. Riley, where an ordinance of the
  time of Richard II. is printed, the translation of which runs as follows:
  'Also, it was ordained that whereas the <i>ale-stakes</i>, projecting in
  front of the taverns in Chepe and elsewhere in the said city, extend too
  far over the king's highways, to the impeding of riders and others, and,
  by reason of their excessive weight, to the great deterioration of the
  houses to which they <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>[269]</span>are fixed,... it was ordained,... that no
  one in future should have a stake <i>bearing either his sign or
  leaves</i> [i.&nbsp;e. a bush] extending or lying over the king's highway,
  <i>of greater length than 7 feet at most</i>,' &amp;c. And, at p. 292 of
  the same work, note 2, Mr. Riley rightly defines an <i>ale-stake</i> to
  be 'the pole projecting from the house, and supporting a bunch of
  leaves.'</p>

  <p>The word <i>ale-stake</i> occurs in Chatterton's poem of Ælla, stanza
  30, where it is used in a manner which shews that the supposed 'Rowley'
  did not know what it was like. See my note on this; Essay on the Rowley
  Poems, p. xix; and cf. note to A. 667.</p>

  <p>322. <i>of a cake</i>; we should now say, a bit of bread; the modern
  sense of 'cake' is a little misleading. The old cakes were mostly made of
  dough, whence the proverb 'my cake is dough,' i.&nbsp;e. is not properly
  baked; Taming of the Shrew, v. 1. 145. Shakespeare also speaks of 'cakes
  and ale,' Tw. Nt. ii. 3. 124. The picture of the 'Simnel Cakes' in
  Chambers' Book of Days, i. 336, illustrates Chaucer's use of the word in
  the Prologue, l. 668.</p>

  <p>324. The Pardoner was so ready to tell some 'mirth or japes' that the
  more decent folks in the company try to repress him. It is a curious
  comment on the popular estimate of his character. He has, moreover, to
  refresh himself, and to think awhile before he can recollect 'some honest
  (i.&nbsp;e. decent) thing.'</p>

  <p>327, 328. The Harleian MS. has&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

<p class="ac"><b>The Pardoneres Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>Title. The Latin text is copied from l. 334 below; it appears in the
  Ellesmere and Hengwrt MSS. The A.&nbsp;V. has&mdash;'the love of money is the
  root of all evil'; 1 Tim. vi. 10. It is well worth notice that the novel
  by Morlinus, quoted in vol. iii. p. 442, as a source of the Pardoner's
  Tale, contains the expression&mdash;'radice malorum cupiditate
  affecti.'</p>

  <p>336. <i>bulles</i>, bulls from the pope, whom he here calls his 'liege
  lord'; see Prol. A. 687, and Piers the Plowman, B. Prol. 69. See also
  Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 308.</p>

  <p><i>alle and somme</i>, one and all. Cf. Clerkes Tale, E. 941, and the
  note.</p>

  <p>337. <i>patente</i>; defined by Webster as 'an official document,
  conferring a right or privilege on some person or party'; &amp;c. It was
  so called because 'patent' or open to public inspection. 'When
  indulgences came to be sold, the pope made them part of his ordinary
  revenue; and, according to the usual way in those, and even in much later
  times, of farming the revenue, he let them out usually to the Dominican
  friars'; Massingberd, Hist. Eng. Reformation, p. 126.</p>

  <p>345. 'To colour my devotion with.' For <i>saffron</i>, MS. Harl. reads
  <i>savore</i>. Tyrwhitt rightly prefers the reading <i>saffron</i>, as
  'more <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page270"></a>[270]</span>expressive, and less likely to have been a
  gloss.' And he adds&mdash;'Saffron was used to give colour as well as
  flavour.' For example, in the Babees Book, ed. Furnivall, p. 275, we read
  of 'capons that ben coloured with saffron.' And in Winter's Tale, iv. 3.
  48, the Clown says&mdash;'I must have saffron to colour the warden-pies.'
  Cf. Sir Thopas, B. 1920. As to the position of <i>with</i>, cf. Sq. Ta.,
  F. 471, 641.</p>

  <p>346. According to Tyrwhitt, this line is, in some MSS. (including
  Camb. Dd. 4. 24. and Addit. 5140), replaced by three, viz.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'In euery village and in euery toun,</p>
      <p>This is my terme, and shal, and euer was,</p>
      <p><i>Radix malorum est cupiditas</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here <i>terme</i> is an error for <i>teme</i>, a variant of
  <i>theme</i>; so that the last two lines merely repeat ll. 333-4.</p>

  <p>347. <i>cristal stones</i>, evidently hollow pieces of crystal in
  which relics were kept; so in the Prologue, A. 700, we have&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And in a <i>glas</i> he hadde pigges bones.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>348. <i>cloutes</i>, rags, bits of cloth. 'The origin of the
  veneration for relics may be traced to Acts, xix. 12. Hence
  <i>clouts</i>, or <i>cloths</i>, are among the Pardoner's stock'; note in
  Bell's edition.</p>

  <p>349. <i>Reliks.</i> In the Prologue, we read that he had the Virgin
  Mary's veil and a piece of the sail of St. Peter's ship. Below, we have
  mention of the shoulder-bone of a holy Jew's sheep, and of a miraculous
  mitten. See Heywood's impudent plagiarism from this passage in his
  description of a Pardoner, as printed in the note to l. 701 of Dr.
  Morris's edition of Chaucer's Prologue. See also a curious list of relics
  in Chambers' Book of Days, i. 587; and compare the humorous descriptions
  of the pardoner and his wares in Sir David Lyndesay's Satyre of the Three
  Estates, ll. 2037-2121. Chaucer probably here took several hints from
  Boccaccio's Decamerone, Day 6, Nov. 10, wherein Frate Cipolla produces
  many very remarkable relics to the public gaze. See also the list of
  relics in Political, Religious, and Love Poems, ed. Furnivall (E. E. T.
  S.), pp. xxxii, 126-9.</p>

  <p>350. <i>latoun.</i> The word <i>latten</i> is still in use in Devon
  and the North of England for plate tin, but as Halliwell remarks, that is
  not the sense of <i>latoun</i> in our older writers. It was a kind of
  mixed metal, somewhat resembling brass both in its nature and colour, but
  still more like pinchbeck. It was used for helmets (Rime of Sir Thopas,
  B. 2067), lavers (P. Pl. Crede, 196), spoons (Nares), sepulchral
  memorials (Way in Prompt. Parv.), and other articles. Todd, in his
  Illustrations of Chaucer, p. 350, remarks that the escutcheons on the
  tomb of the Black Prince are of <i>laton</i> over-gilt, in accordance
  with the Prince's instructions; see Nichols's Royal Wills, p. 67. He
  adds&mdash;'In our old Church Inventories a <i>cross of laton</i>
  frequently occurs.' See Prol. A. 699, and the note. I here copy the
  description of this metal given in Batman upon Bartholomè; lib. xvi. c.
  5. '<i>Of Laton.</i> <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>[271]</span>Laton is called <i>Auricalcum</i>, and
  hath that name, for, though it be brasse or copper, yet it shineth as
  gold without, as <i>Isidore</i> saith; for brasse is <i>calco</i> in
  Greeke. Also <i>laton</i> is hard as brasse or copper; for by medling of
  copper, of tinne, and of auripigment [orpiment] and with other mettal, it
  is brought in the fire to the colour of gold, as <i>Isidore</i> saith.
  Also it hath colour and likenesse of gold, but not the value.'</p>

  <p>351. The expression 'holy Jew' is remarkable, as the usual feeling in
  the middle ages was to regard all Jews with abhorrence. It is suggested,
  in a note to Bell's edition, that it 'must be understood of some Jew
  before the Incarnation.' Perhaps the Pardoner wished it to be understood
  that the sheep was once the property of Jacob; this would help to give
  force to l. 365. Cp. Gen. xxx.</p>

  <p>The best comment on the virtues of a sheep's shoulder-bone is afforded
  by a passage in the Persones Tale (De Ira), I. 602, where we
  find&mdash;'Sweringe sodeynly withoute avysement is eek a sinne. But lat
  us go now to thilke horrible swering of adiuracioun and coniuracioun, as
  doon thise false enchauntours or nigromanciens in bacins ful of water, or
  in a bright swerd, in a cercle, or in a fyr, or in a <i>shulder-boon of a
  sheep</i>'; &amp;c. Cf. also a curious passage in Trevisa's tr. of
  Higden's Polychronicon, lib. i. cap. 60, which shews that it was known
  among the Flemings who had settled in the west of Wales. He tells us
  that, by help of a bone of a wether's right shoulder, from which the
  flesh had been boiled (not roasted) away, they could tell what was being
  done in far countries, 'tokens of pees and of werre, the staat of the
  reeme, sleynge of men, and spousebreche.' Selden, in his notes to song 5
  of Drayton's Polyolbion, gives a curious instance of such divination,
  taken from Giraldus, Itin. i. cap. 11; and a writer in the Retrospective
  Review, Feb. 1854, p. 109, says it is 'similar to one described by Wm. de
  Rubruquis as practised among the Tartars.' And see <i>spade-bone</i> in
  Nares. Cf. Notes and Queries, 1 S. ii. 20.</p>

  <p>In Part I. of the Records of the Folk-lore Society is an article by
  Mr. Thoms on the subject of divination by means of the shoulder-bone of a
  sheep. He shews that it was still practised in the Scottish Highlands
  down to the beginning of the present century, and that it is known in
  Greece. He further cites some passages concerning it from some scarce
  books; and ends by saying&mdash;'let me refer any reader desirous of
  knowing more of this wide-spread form of divination to Sir H. Ellis's
  edition of Brand's Popular Antiquities, iii. 179, ed. 1842, and to much
  curious information respecting <i>Spatulamancia</i>, as it is called by
  Hartlieb, and an analogous species of divination <i>ex anserino
  sterno</i>, to Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie, 2nd ed. p. 1067.'</p>

  <p>355. The sense is&mdash;'which any snake has bitten or stung.' The
  reference is to the poisonous effects of the bite of an adder or venomous
  snake. The word <i>worm</i> is used by Shakespeare to describe the asp
  whose bite was fatal to Cleopatra; and it is sometimes used to describe a
  dragon of the largest size. In Icelandic, the term 'miðgarðsormr,' <!--
  Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>[272]</span>lit.
  worm of the middle-earth, signifies a great sea-serpent encompassing the
  entire world.</p>

  <p>363. <i>Fastinge.</i> This word is spelt with a final <i>e</i> in all
  seven MSS.; and as it is emphatic and followed by a slight pause, perhaps
  the final <i>e</i> should be pronounced. Cp. A.&nbsp;S. <i>fæstende</i>, the
  older form of the present participle. Otherwise, the first foot consists
  of but one syllable.</p>

  <p>366. For <i>heleth</i>, MS. Hl. has <i>kelith</i>, i.&nbsp;e. cooleth.</p>

  <p>379. The final <i>e</i> in <i>sinne</i> must not be elided; it is
  preserved by the caesura. Besides, <i>e</i> is only elided before
  <i>h</i> in the case of certain words.</p>

  <p>387. <i>assoile</i>, absolve. In Michelet's Life of Luther, tr. by W.
  Hazlitt, chap. ii, there is a very similar passage concerning Tetzel, the
  Dominican friar, whose shameless sale of indulgences roused Luther to his
  famous denunciations of the practice. Tetzel 'went about from town to
  town, with great display, pomp, and expense, hawking the commodity [i.&nbsp;e.
  the indulgences] in the churches, in the public streets, in taverns and
  ale-houses. He paid over to his employers as little as possible,
  pocketing the balance, as was subsequently proved against him. The faith
  of the buyers diminishing, it became necessary to exaggerate to the
  fullest extent the merit of the specific.... The intrepid Tetzel
  stretched his rhetoric to the very uttermost bounds of amplification.
  Daringly piling one lie upon another, he set forth, in reckless display,
  the long list of evils which this panacea could cure. He did not content
  himself with enumerating known sins; he set his foul imagination to work,
  and invented crimes, infamous atrocities, strange, unheard of, unthought
  of; and when he saw his auditors stand aghast at each horrible
  suggestion, he would calmly repeat the burden of his song:&mdash;Well,
  all this is expiated the moment your money chinks in the pope's chest.'
  This was in the year 1517.</p>

  <p>390. <i>An hundred mark.</i> A mark was worth about 13<i>s.</i>
  4<i>d.</i>, and 100 marks about £66 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> In order to
  make allowance for the difference in the value of money in that age, we
  must at least multiply by ten; or we may say in round numbers, that the
  Pardoner made at least £700 a year. We may contrast this with Chaucer's
  own pension of 20 marks, granted him in 1367, and afterwards increased
  till, in the very last year of his life, he received in all, according to
  Sir Harris Nicolas, as much as £61 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Even then his
  income did not quite attain to the 100 marks which the Pardoner gained so
  easily.</p>

  <p>397. <i>dowve</i>, a pigeon; lit. a dove. See a similar line in the
  Milleres Tale, A. 3258.</p>

  <p>402. <i>namely</i>, especially, in particular; cf. Kn. Ta. 410 (A.
  1068).</p>

  <p>406. <i>blakeberied.</i> The line means&mdash;'Though their souls go
  a-blackberrying'; i.&nbsp;e. wander wherever they like. This is a well-known
  <i>crux</i>, which all the editors have given up as unintelligible. I
  have been so fortunate as to obtain the complete solution of it, which
  was printed in Notes and Queries, 4 S. x. 222, xii. 45, and again in my
  preface to the C-text of Piers the Plowman, p. lxxxvii. The simple
  explanation is that, by a grammatical construction which was <!-- Page
  273 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>[273]</span>probably
  due (as will be shewn) to an error, the verb <i>go</i> could be combined
  with what was <i>apparently</i> a past participle, in such a manner as to
  give the participle the force of a verbal substantive. In other words,
  instead of saying 'he goes a-hunting,' our forefathers sometimes said 'he
  goes a-hunted.' The examples of this use are at least seven. The clearest
  is in Piers Plowman, C. ix. 138, where we read of 'folk that gon
  a-begged,' i.&nbsp;e. folk that go a-begging. In Chaucer, we not only have
  'goon a-begged,' Frank. Tale, F. 1580, and the instance in the present
  passage, but yet a third example in the Wyf of Bath's Tale, Group D. 354,
  where we have 'goon a-caterwawed,' with the sense of 'to go
  a-caterwauling'; and it is a fortunate circumstance that in two of these
  cases the idiomatic forms occur at the end of a line, so that the rime
  has preserved them from being tampered with. Gower (Conf. Amant. bk. i.
  ed. Chalmers, pp. 32, 33, or ed. Pauli, i. 110) speaks of a king of
  Hungary riding out 'in the month of May,' adding&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'This king with noble purueiance</p>
      <p>Hath for him-selfe his chare [<i>car</i>] arayed,</p>
      <p>Wherein he wolde ryde <i>amayed</i>,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>that is, wherein he wished to ride <i>a-Maying</i>. Again (in bk. v,
  ed. Chalmers, p. 124, col. 2, or ed. Pauli, ii. 132) we read of a drunken
  priest losing his way:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'This prest was dronke, and <i>goth a-strayed</i>';</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. he goes a-straying, or goes astray.</p>

  <p>The explanation of this construction I take to be this; the <i><span
  class="nw">-ed</span></i> was not really a sign of the past participle,
  but a corruption of the ending <i><span class="nw">-eth</span></i> (A.
  S.<i><span class="nw">-að</span></i>) which is sometimes found at the end
  of a verbal substantive. Hence it is that, in the passage from Piers
  Plowman above quoted, one of the best and earliest MSS. actually reads
  'folk that gon a-beggeth.' And again, in another passage (P. Pl., C. ix.
  246) is the phrase 'gon abrybeth,' or, in some MSS., 'gon abrybed,' i.&nbsp;e.
  go a-bribing or go a-thieving, since Mid. Eng. <i>briben</i> often means
  to rob. This form is clearly an imitation of the form <i>a-hunteth</i> in
  the old phrase <i>gon a-hunteth</i> or <i>riden an honteth</i>, used by
  Robert of Gloucester (Specimens of English, ed. Morris and Skeat, p. 14,
  l. 387):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'As he <i>rod an honteth</i>, and par-auntre [h]is hors spurnde.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now this <i>honteth</i> is the dat. case of a substantive, viz. of the
  A. S. <i>huntað</i> or <i>huntoð</i>. This substantive would easily be
  mistaken for a part of a verb, and, particularly, for the past participle
  of a verb; just as many people at this day are quite unable to
  distinguish between the true verbal substantive and the present
  participle in <i><span class="nw">-ing</span></i>. This mistake once
  established, the ending <i><span class="nw">-ed</span></i> would be
  freely used after the verbs <i>go</i> or <i>ride</i>. In D. 1778, we even
  find <i>go walked</i>, without <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>The result is that the present phrase, hitherto so puzzling, is a mere
  variation of 'gon a blake-berying,' i.&nbsp;e. 'go a-gathering blackberries,'
  a humorous expression for 'wander wherever they please.' A not very <!--
  Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page274"></a>[274]</span>dissimilar expression occurs in the
  proverbial saying&mdash;'his wits are gone a-wool-gathering.'</p>

  <p>The Pardoner says, in effect, 'I promise them full absolution;
  however, when they die and are buried, it matters little to me in what
  direction their souls go.'</p>

  <p>407. Tyrwhitt aptly adduces a parallel passage from the Romaunt of the
  Rose, l. 5763 (or l. 5129 in the French)&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife'; Phil. i. 15.</p>

  <p>413. In Piers Plowman (B-text), v. 87, it is said of Envy
  that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg1">'Eche a worde that he warpe · was of an addres tonge.'</p>

  <p>Cf. Rom. iii. 13; Ps. cxl. 3.</p>

  <p>440. <i>for I teche</i>, because I teach, by my teaching.</p>

  <p>441. <i>Wilful pouerte</i> signifies voluntary poverty. This is well
  illustrated by the following lines concerning Christ in Piers Plowman, B.
  xx. 48, 49:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Syth he that wroughte al the worlde · was <i>wilfullich</i> nedy,</p>
      <p>Ne neuer non so nedy · ne pouerer deyde.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Several examples occur in Richardson's Dictionary in which
  <i>wilfully</i> has the sense of <i>willingly</i> or <i>voluntarily</i>.
  Thus&mdash;'If they <i>wylfully</i> would renounce the sayd place and put
  them in his grace, he wolde vtterlye pardon theyr trespace'; Fabyan's
  Chronicle, c. 114. It even means <i>gladly</i>; thus in Wyclif's Bible,
  Acts xxi. 17, we find, 'britherin resseyuyden vs <i>wilfulli</i>.'
  Speaking of palmers, Speght says&mdash;'The <i>pilgrim</i> travelled at
  his own charge, the <i>palmer</i> professed wilful poverty.'</p>

  <p>The word <i>wilful</i> still means <i>willing</i> in Warwickshire; see
  Eng. Dialect Soc. Gloss. C. 6.</p>

  <p>445. The context seems to imply that some of the apostles made
  baskets. So in Piers Plowman, B. xv. 285, we read of St. Paul&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Poule, after his prechyng · <i>panyers</i> he made.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Yet in Acts xviii. 3 we only read that he wrought as a tent-maker.
  However, it was St. Paul who set the example of labouring with his hands;
  and, in imitation of him, we find an early example of basket-making by
  St. Arsenius, 'who, before he turned hermit, had been the tutor of the
  emperors Arcadius and Honorius,' and who is represented in a fresco in
  the Campo Santo at Pisa, by Pietro Laurati, as 'weaving baskets of
  palm-leaves'; whilst beside him another hermit is cutting wooden spoons,
  and another is fishing. See Mrs. Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art, 3rd
  ed. ii. 757.</p>

  <p>Note that <i>baskettes</i> is trisyllabic, as in Palladius on
  Husbandry, bk. xii. l. 307.</p>

  <p>448. The best description of the house-to-house system of begging, as
  adopted by the mendicant friars, is near the beginning of the <!-- Page
  275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>[275]</span>Sompnour's
  Tale, D. 1738. They went in pairs to the farm-houses, begging a bushel of
  wheat, or malt, or rye, or a piece of cheese or brawn, or bacon or beef,
  or even a piece of an old blanket. Nothing seems to have come amiss to
  them.</p>

  <p>450. See Prologue, A. 255; and cf. the description of the poor widow
  at the beginning of the Nonne Prestes Tale, B. 4011.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Pardoneres Tale.</b></p>

  <p>For some account of the source of this Tale, see vol. iii. p. 439. The
  account which I here quote as the 'Italian' text is that contained in
  Novella lxxxii of the Libro di Novelle.</p>

  <p>Observe also the quotations from Pope Innocent given in vol. iii. pp.
  444, 445. To which may be added, that Chaucer here frequently quotes from
  his Persones Tale, which must have been written previously. Compare ll.
  475, 482, 504, 529, 558, 590, 631-650, with I. 591, 836, 819, 820, 822,
  793, 587-593.</p>

  <p>463. In laying the scene in Flanders, Chaucer probably followed an
  original which is now lost. Andrew Borde, in his amusing Introduction of
  Knowledge, ch. viii, says:&mdash;'Flaunders is a plentyfull countre of
  fyshe &amp; fleshe &amp; wyld fowle. Ther shal a man be clenly serued at
  his table, &amp; well ordred and vsed for meate &amp; drynke &amp;
  lodgyng. The countre is playn, &amp; somwhat sandy. The people be gentyl,
  but the men be great drynkers; and many of the women be vertuous and wel
  dysposyd.' He describes the Fleming as saying&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'I am a Fleming, what for all that,</p>
      <p>Although I wyll be dronken other whyles as a rat?</p>
      <p class="hg3">"Buttermouth Flemyng" men doth me call,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>464. <i>haunteden</i>, followed after; cf. note to l. 547. The same
  expression occurs in The Tale of Beryn, a spurious (but not ill-told)
  addition to the Canterbury Tales:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>473. <i>grisly</i>, terrible, enough to make one shudder. It is
  exactly the right word. The mention of these oaths reminds us of the
  admission of my Uncle Toby in Sterne's Tristram Shandy, ch. xi, that 'our
  armies swore terribly <i>in Flanders</i>.'</p>

  <p>474. <i>to-tere</i>, tear in pieces, dismember. Cf. <i>to-rente</i> in
  B. 3215; see note on p. 229. Chaucer elsewhere says&mdash;'For Cristes
  sake ne swereth nat so sinfully, in <i>dismembringe</i> of Crist, by
  soule, herte, bones, and body; for certes it semeth, that ye thinke that
  the cursede Iewes ne dismembred nat ynough the preciouse persone of

  <p>And again (ii. 130) he complains of swearers who crucify Christ

  <p>477. <i>tombesteres</i>, female dancers. 'Sir Perdicas, whom that
  kinge Alysandre made to been his heire in Grece, was of no ki<i>n</i>ges
  blod; his dame [<i>mother</i>] was a to<i>m</i>bystere'; Testament of
  Love, Book ii. ed. 1561, fol. ccxcvi b.</p>

  <p><i>Tombestere</i> is the feminine form; the A. S. spelling would be
  <i>tumbestre</i>; the masc. form is the A.&nbsp;S. <i>tumbere</i>, which is
  glossed by <i>saltator</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a dancer; the verb is <i>tumbian</i>,
  to dance, used of Herodias' daughter in the A.&nbsp;S. version of Mark, vi.
  22. The medieval idea of <i>tumbling</i> was, that the lady stood on her
  hands with her heels in the air; see Strutt, Sports, &amp;c. bk. iii. c.
  5.</p>

  <p>On the feminine termination <i>-ster</i> (formerly <i><span
  class="nw">-estre</span></i>, or <i><span class="nw">-stre</span></i>)
  see the remarks in Marsh's Lectures on the English Language, printed in
  (the so-called) Smith's Student's Manual of the English Language, ed.
  1862, pp. 207, 208, with an additional note at p. 217. Marsh's remarks
  are, in this case, less clear than usual. He shews that the termination
  was not always used as a feminine, and that, in fact, its force was early
  lost. It is, however, merely a question of chronology. That the
  termination was <i>originally</i> feminine in Anglo-Saxon, is
  sufficiently proved by the A. S. version of the Gospels. There we find
  the word <i>witega</i> frequently used in the sense of <i>prophet</i>;
  but, in one instance, where it is necessary to express the
  <i>feminine</i>, we find this accomplished by the use of this very
  termination. 'And anna waes <i>witegystre</i> (another MS.
  <i>witegestre</i>)'; i.&nbsp;e. and Anna was a <i>prophetess</i>, Luke, ii.
  36. Similar instances might easily be multiplied; see Dr. Morris's Hist.
  Outlines of Eng. Accidence, pp. 89, 90. Thus, <i>wasshestren</i> (pl.) is
  used as the <!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page277"></a>[277]</span>translation of <i>lotrices</i>; Old Eng.
  Homilies, ed. Morris, ii. 57. But it is also true that, in the fourteenth
  century, the feminine force of this termination was becoming very weak,
  so that, whilst in P. Plowman, B. v. 306, we find 'Beton the
  <i>brewestere</i>' applied to a female brewer, we cannot thence certainly
  conclude that 'brewestere' was always feminine at that period. On the
  other hand, we may point to one word, <i>spinster</i>, which has remained
  feminine to this very day.</p>

  <p>Dr. Morris remarks that <i>tombestere</i> is a hybrid word; in which I
  believe that he has been misled by the spelling. It is a pure native
  word, from the A.&nbsp;S. <i>tumbian</i>, but the scribes have turned it from
  <i>tumbestere</i> into <i>tombestere</i>, by confusion with the French
  <i>tomber</i>. Yet even the Fr. <i>tomber</i> was once spelt
  <i>tumber</i> (Burguy, Roquefort), being, in fact, a word of Germanic
  origin. An acrobat can still be called a <i>tumbler</i>: we find
  'rope-dancers and <i>tumblers</i>' in Locke, Conduct of the
  Understanding, § 4. Indeed, the Cambridge MS. has here the true spelling
  <i>tumbesteris</i>, whilst the Corpus, Petworth, and Lansdowne MSS. have
  the variations <i>tomblisteres</i> and <i>tomblesters</i>. The A.&nbsp;S.
  masc. form <i>tumbere</i> occurs in Ælfric's Vocabulary.</p>

  <p>As to the <i>source</i> of the suffix <i>-ster</i>, it is really a
  compound suffix, due to composition of the Aryan suffixes <i><span
  class="nw">-es</span></i> and <i><span class="nw">-ter-</span></i>; cf.
  Lat. <i>mag-is-ter</i>, <i>min-is-ter</i>, <i>poet-as-ter</i>. The
  feminine use is peculiar to Anglo-Saxon and to some other Teutonic
  languages.</p>

  <p>478. <i>fruytesteres</i>, female sellers of fruit; see note to last
  line.</p>

  <p>479. <i>wafereres</i>, sellers of confectionery, confectioners. The
  feminine form <i>wafrestre</i> occurs in Piers Plowman, v. 641. From
  Beaumont and Fletcher we learn that 'wafer-women' were often employed in
  amorous embassies, as stated in Nares' Glossary, q.&nbsp;v.</p>

  <p>483. <i>holy writ.</i> In the margin of the MSS. E. Hn. Cp. Pt. and
  Hl. is the note&mdash;'Nolite inebriari vino, in quo est luxuria,' quoted
  from the Vulgate version of Eph. v. 18. See vol. iii. p. 444.</p>

  <p>487. Cp. Ln. have here two additional spurious lines. Cp.
  reads&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'So drunke he was, he nyste what he wrought,</p>
      <p><i>And therfore sore repente him oughte</i>.</p>
      <p>Heroudes, who-so wole the stories seche,</p>
      <p><i>Ther may ye lerne and by ensample teche</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of the second line, Dr. Furnivall remarks&mdash;'Besides being a line
  of only 4 measures, it is foolish&mdash;how could Lot in the grave repent
  him? Both lines [those in italics] interrupt the flow of the story, and
  weaken the instances brought forward.' He adds&mdash;'None of our best
  MSS. have these spurious lines.'</p>

  <p>They evidently arose from the stupidity of some scribe, who did not
  understand that <i>soghte</i> is here the pt. t. subj., meaning 'were to
  seek.' He therefore 'corrected' Chaucer's grammar by writing <i>wol</i>
  for <i>wel</i> and <i>seche</i> for <i>soghte</i>; and he then had to
  make up two more lines to hide the alteration.</p>

  <p>488. 'Herod, (as may be seen by any one) who would consult the <!--
  Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page278"></a>[278]</span>"stories" carefully.' The Harleian MS. has
  the inferior reading <i>story</i>; but the reference is particular, not
  vague. Peter Comestor (died <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 1198) was the
  author of an Historia Scholastica, on which account he was called 'the
  maister of stories,' or 'clerk of the stories,' as explained in my note
  to Piers Plowman, B. vii. 73. The use of the plural is due to the fact
  that the whole Historia Scholastica, which is a sort of epitome of the
  Bible, with notes and additions, is divided into sections, each of which
  is <i>also</i> called 'Historia.' The account of Herod occurs, of course,
  in the section entitled Historia Evangelica, cap. lxxii; De decollatione
  ioannis. Cf. Matt. xiv; Mark vi. And see vol. iii. p. 444.</p>

  <p>492. <i>Senek</i>, Seneca. The reference appears to be, as pointed out
  by Tyrwhitt, to Seneca's Letters; Epist. lxxxiii: 'Extende in plures dies
  illum ebrii habitum: numquid de furore dubitabis? nunc quoque non est
  minor, sed brevior.'</p>

  <p>496. 'Except that madness, when it has come upon a man of evil nature,
  lasts longer than does a fit of drunkenness.' See <i>Shrew</i> in Trench,
  Select Glossary.</p>

  <p>499. 'First cause of our misfortune'; alluding to the Fall of Adam.
  See l. 505.</p>

  <p>501. <i>boght us agayn</i>, redeemed us; a translation of the Latin
  <i>redemit</i>. Hence we find Christ called, in Middle English, the
  <i>A&#x21D;enbyer</i>. 'See now how dere he [Christ] boughte man, that he
  made after his owne ymage, and how dere he <i>a&#x21D;enboght</i> us, for
  the grete love that he hadde to us'; Sir J. Maundeville, Prologue to his
  Voiage (Specimens of Eng. 1298-1393, p. 165). See l. 766 below.</p>

  <p>504. Cf. Pers. Tale, I. 819.</p>

  <p>505. Here, in the margin of MS. E. Hn. Cp. Pt. Hl., is a quotation
  from 'Hieronymus contra Jovinianum' (i.&nbsp;e. from St. Jerome): 'Quamdiu
  ieiunauit Adam, in Paradiso fuit; comedit et eiectus est; eiectus, statim
  duxit uxorem.' See Hieron. contra Jov. lib. ii. c. 15; ed. Migne, ii.
  305.</p>

  <p>510. <i>defended</i>, forbidden. Even Milton has it; see P. Lost, xi.
  86. See also l. 590 below.</p>

  <p>512. 'O gluttony! it would much behove us to complain of thee!' See
  vol. iii. pp. 444, 445. The quotation 'Noli auidus' (iii. 445) is from
  the close of Ecclus. xxxvii.</p>

  <p>517. Here Chaucer is thinking of a passage in Jerome, which also
  occurs in John of Salisbury's Policraticus, lib. viii. c. 6. In such
  cases, Chaucer consulted Jerome himself, rather than his copyist, as
  might be shewn. I therefore quote from the former.</p>

  <p>'Propter breuem gulae uoluptatem, terrae lustrantur et maria: et ut

  Hieron. Basil. 1524, t. ii. p. 76.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he had an eye to the passage in Pope Innocent,
  quoted in vol. iii. p. 445. 'The shorte throte' answers to 'Tam breuis
  est,' &amp;c. <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>522. In the margin of MSS. E. and Hn. is written the
  quotation&mdash;'Esca ventri, et venter escis. Deus autem et hunc et
  illam destruet.' For <i>illam</i>, the usual reading of the Vulgate is
  <i>has</i>; see 1 Cor. vi. 13.</p>

  <p>526. <i>whyte and rede</i>, white wine and red wine; see note to Piers
  Plowman, B. prol. 228, and the note to B. 4032 above, p. 249.</p>

  <p>527. Again from Jerome (see note to l. 517). 'Qualis [est] ista

  <p>538. See the quotation in vol. iii. p. 445.</p>

  <p>There is a somewhat similar passage in John of Salisbury, as

  <p>539. There is here an allusion to the famous disputes in scholastic
  philosophy between the Realists and Nominalists. To attempt any
  explanation of their language is to become lost in subtleties of
  distinction. It would seem however that the Realists maintained that
  everything possesses a <i>substance</i>, which is inherent in itself, and
  distinct from the <i>accidents</i> or outward phenomena which the thing
  presents. According to them, the form, smell, taste, colour, of anything
  are merely <i>accidents</i>, and might be changed without affecting the
  <i>substance</i> itself. See the excellent article on <i>Substance</i> in
  the Engl. Cyclopaedia; also that on <i>Nominalists</i>. Cf. Wyclif's
  Works, ed. Matthew, p. 526.</p>

  <p>According to Chaucer, then, or rather, according to Pope Innocent
  III., (of all people), the cooks who toil to satisfy man's appetite
  change the nature of the things cooked so effectually as to confound
  <i>substance</i> with <i>accident</i>. Translated into plain language, it
  means that those who partook of the meats so prepared, could not, by
  means of their taste and smell, form any precise idea as to what they
  were eating. The art is not lost. Cf. Troil. iv. 1505.</p>

  <p>547. <i>haunteth</i>, practises, indulges in; cf. l. 464. In the
  margin of MSS. E. and Hn. is written&mdash;'Qui autem in deliciis est,
  viuens mortuus est.' This is a quotation from the Vulgate version of 1
  Tim. v. 6, but with <i>Qui</i> for <i>quae</i>, and <i>mortuus</i> for
  <i>mortua</i>.</p>

  <p>549. In the margin of MSS. E. and Hn. is written&mdash;'Luxuriosa res
  vinum, et contumeliosa ebrietas.' The Vulgate version of Prov. xx. 1 <!--
  Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page280"></a>[280]</span>agrees with this nearly, but has
  <i>tumultuosa</i> for <i>contumeliosa</i>. This is of course the text to
  which Chaucer refers. And see note to the parallel passage at B. 771-7.
  The variant <i>contumeliosa</i> occurs in the text as quoted by St.
  Jerome, Contra Jovinianum, lib. ii. 10 (Köppel).</p>

  <p>554. He means that the drunkard's stertorous breathing seems to repeat
  the sound of the word <i>Sampsoún</i>. The word was probably chosen for
  the sake of its nasal sounds, to imitate a sort of grunt. Perhaps we
  should here pronounce the <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> as in French, but with
  exaggerated emphasis. So also in l. 572.</p>

  <p>555. See note to the Monkes Tale, B. 3245. In Judges, xiii. 4, 7, the
  command to drink no wine is addressed, not to Samson, but to his mother.
  Of Samson himself it is said that he was 'a Nazarite,' which implies the
  same thing; see Numbers, vi. 3, 5.</p>

  <p>558. <i>sepulture</i>, burial; see Pers. Tale, I. 822.</p>

  <p>561. In Chaucer's Tale of Melibeus (B. 2383) we find&mdash;'Thou shalt
  also eschewe the conseiling of folk that been dronkelewe; for they ne can
  no conseil hyde; for Salomon seith, Ther is no privetee ther-as regneth
  dronkenesse'; and see B. 776. The allusion is to Prov. xxxi. 4: 'Noli
  regibus, O Lamuel, noli regibus dare uinum; quia nullum secretum est ubi
  regnat ebrietas.' This last clause is quite different from that in our
  own version; which furnishes, perhaps, a reason why the allusion here
  intended has not been perceived by previous editors.</p>

  <p>563. <i>namely</i>, especially. Tyrwhitt's note is as follows:
  'According to the geographers, Lepe was not far from Cadiz. This wine, of
  whatever sort it may have been, was probably much stronger than the
  Gascon wines, usually drunk in England. La Rochelle and Bordeaux (l.
  571), the two chief ports of Gascony, were both, in Chaucer's time, part
  of the English dominions.</p>

  <p>'Spanish wines might also be more alluring upon account of their great
  rarity. Among the Orders of the Royal Household, in 1604, is the
  following (MS. Harl. 293, fol. 162): "And whereas, in tymes past, Spanish
  wines, called Sacke, were little or noe whit used in our courte, and that
  in later years, though not of ordinary allowance, it was thought
  convenient that noblemen ... might have a boule or glas, &amp;c. We
  understanding that it is now used as common drinke ... reduce the
  allowance to xii. gallons a day for the court,"' &amp;c. Several
  regulations to be observed by London vintners are mentioned in the Liber
  Albus, ed. Riley, pp. 614-618. Amongst them is&mdash;'Item, that white
  wine of Gascoigne, of la Rochele, of Spain, or other place, shall not be
  put in cellars with Rhenish wines.' See also note to l. 565.</p>

  <p>564. <i>To selle</i>, for sale; the true gerund, of which <i>to</i>
  is, in Anglo-Saxon, the sign. So also 'this house <i>to let</i>' is the
  correct old idiom, needing no such alteration as some would make. Cf.
  Morris, Hist. Outlines of Eng. Accidence, sect. 290, subsect. 4. Fish
  Street leads out of Lower Thames Street, close to the North end of London
  Bridge. The Harleian MS. alone reads <i>Fleet Street</i>, which is
  certainly wrong. <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page281"></a>[281]</span>Considering that Thames Street is
  especially mentioned as a street for vintners (Liber Albus, p. 614), and
  that Chaucer's own father was a Thames Street vintner, there can be
  little doubt about this matter. The poet is here speaking from his own
  knowledge; a consideration which gives the present passage a peculiar
  interest. <i>Chepe</i> is Cheapside.</p>

  <p>565. This is a fine touch. The poet here tells us that some of this
  strong Spanish wine used to find its way mysteriously into other wines;
  not (he ironically suggests) because the vintners ever mixed their wines,
  but because the vines of Spain notoriously grew so close to those of
  Gascony that it was not possible to keep them apart! <i>Crepeth
  subtilly</i> = finds its way mysteriously. Observe the humour in the word
  <i>growing</i>, which expresses that the mixture of wines must be due to
  the proximity of the vines producing them in the vineyards, not to any
  accidental proximity of the casks containing them in the vintners'
  cellars. In fact, the different kinds of wine were to be kept in
  different cellars, as the Regulations in the Liber Albus (pp. 615-618)
  shew. 'Item, that no Taverner shall put Rhenish wine and White wine in a
  cellar together.' 'Item, that new wines shall not be put in cellars with
  old wines.' 'Item, that White wine of Gascoigne, of la Rochele, of Spain,
  or other place shall not be put in cellars with Rhenish wines.' 'Item,
  that white wine shall not be sold for Rhenish wine.' 'Item, that no one
  shall expose for sale wines counterfeit or mixed, made by himself or by
  another, under pain of being set upon the pillory.' But pillories have
  vanished, and all such laws are obsolete.</p>

  <p>570. 'He is in Spain'; i.&nbsp;e. he is, as it were, transported thither.
  He imagines he has never left Cheapside, yet is far from knowing where he
  is, as we should say.</p>

  <p>571. 'Not at Rochelle,' where the wines are weak.</p>

  <p>579. 'The death of Attila took place in 453. The commonly received
  account is that given by Jornandes, that he died by the bursting of a
  blood-vessel on the night of his marriage with a beautiful maiden, whom
  he added to his many other wives; some, with a natural suspicion, impute
  it to the hand of his bride. Priscus observes, that no one ever subdued
  so many countries in so short a time.... Jornandes, De Rebus Geticis, and
  Priscus, Excerpta de Legationibus, furnish the best existing materials
  for the history of Attila. For modern compilations, see Buat, Histoire
  des Peuples de l'Europe; De Guignes, Hist. des Huns; and Gibbon, capp.
  xxxiv and xxxv'; English Cyclopaedia. And see Amédée Thierry, Histoire
  d'Attila.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jephson (in Bell's Chaucer) quotes the account of Attila's death
  given by Paulus Diaconus, Gest. Rom. lib. xv: 'Qui reuersus ad proprias
  sedes, supra plures quas habebat uxores, valde decoram, indicto nomine,
  sibi in matrimonium iunxit. Ob cuius nuptias profusa conuiuia exercens,
  dum tantum uini quantum nunquam antea insimul bibisset, cum supinus
  quiesceret, eruptione sanguinis, qui ei de naribus solitus erat effluere,
  suffocatus et extinctus est.'</p>

  <p>The older account in Jornandes, De Rebus Geticis, § 82, is of more
  <!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page282"></a>[282]</span>interest. 'Qui [Attila], ut Priscus
  historicus refert, extinctionis suae tempore puellam, Ildico nomine,
  decoram valde, sibi in matrimonium post innumerabiles uxores, vt mos est
  gentis illius, socians: eiusque in nuptiis magna hilaritate resolutus,
  vino somnoque grauatus, resupinus iacebat; redundansque sanguis, qui ei
  solitè de naribus effluebat, dum consuetis meatibus impeditur, itinere
  ferali faucibus illapsus eum extinxit.'</p>

  <p>585. <i>Lamuel</i>, i.&nbsp;e. King Lemuel, mentioned in Prov. xxxi. 1, q.
  v.; not to be confused, says Chaucer, with Samuel. The allusion is to
  Prov. xxxi. 4, 5; and not (as Mr. Wright suggests) to Prov. xxiii. In
  fact, in the margin of MSS. E. and Hn. is written 'Noli uinum dare,'
  words found in Prov. xxxi. 4. See note to l. 561.</p>

  <p>590. Compare Pers. Tale, I. 793.</p>

  <p>591. <i>Hasard</i>, gambling. In the margin of MSS. E. and Hn. is
  written&mdash;'Policratici libro primo; Mendaciorum et periuriarum mater
  est Alea.' This shews that the line is a quotation from lib. i. [cap. 5]
  of the Polycraticus of John of Salisbury, bishop of Chartres, who died in
  1180. See some account of this work in Prof. Morley's Eng. Writers, iii.
  180. 'In the first book, John treats of temptations and duties and of
  vanities, such as hunting, <i>dice</i>, music, mimes and minstrelsy,
  magic and soothsaying, prognostication by dreams and astrology.' See also
  the account of gaming, considered as a branch of Avarice in the Ayenbyte
  of Inwyt, ed. Morris, pp. 45, 46.</p>

  <p>595. Cf. 'Nonne satis improbata est cuiusque artis exercitatio, qua
  quanto quisque doctior, tanto nequior? Aleator quidem omnis hic
  est.'&mdash;Joh. Sarisb. Polycrat. i. 5.</p>

  <p>603. <i>Stilbon.</i> It should rather be <i>Chilon</i>. Tyrwhitt
  remarks&mdash;'John of Salisbury, from whom our author probably took this
  story and the following, calls him <i>Chilon</i>; Polycrat. lib. i. c. 5.
  "Chilon Lacedaemonius, iungendae societatis causa missus Corinthum, duces
  et seniores populi ludentes inuenit in alea. Infecto itaque negotio
  reuersus est [dicens se nolle gloriam Spartanorum, quorum uirtus
  constructo Byzantio clarescebat, hac maculare infamia, ut dicerentur cum
  aleatoribus contraxisse societatem]." Accordingly, in ver. 12539 [l.
  605], MS. C. 1 [i.&nbsp;e. MS. Camb. Univ. Lib. Dd. 4. 24] reads very rightly
  <i>Lacedomye</i> instead of <i>Calidone</i>, the common reading [of the
  old editions]. Our author has used before <i>Lacedomie</i> for
  <i>Lacedaemon</i>, v. 11692 [Frank. Tale, F. 1380].'</p>

  <p>In the Petw. MS., the name <i>Stilbon</i> is explained as meaning
  <i>Mercurius</i>. So, in Liddell and Scott's Gk. Lexicon, we have '<span
  title="stilbôn, -ontos, ho" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&iota;&lambda;&beta;&omega;&nu;,
  -&omicron;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;, &#x1F41;</span> <i>the planet
  Mercury</i>, Arist. Mund. 2. 9; cf. Cic. Nat. D. 2. 20.' The original
  sense of the word was 'shining,' from the verb <span title="stilbein" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&#x1F77;&lambda;&beta;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>, to
  glitter.</p>

  <p>Chaucer has given the wrong name. He was familiar with the name
  <i>Stilbon</i> (for Mercury), as it occurs (1) in the Epistola Valerii ad
  Rufinum, c. 27; (2) in the work of Martianus referred to in E. 1732; and
  (3) in the Anticlaudian, Distinctio quarta, c. 6. Cf. D. 671; E. 1732;
  Ho. Fame, 986; Notes and Queries, 8th S. iv. 175. <!-- Page 283 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>[283]</span></p>

  <p>608. The first foot has but one syllable, viz. <i>Pley</i>.
  <i>atte</i>, for <i>at the</i>. Tyrwhitt oddly remarks here, that
  '<i>atte</i> has frequently been corrupted into <i>at the</i>,' viz. in
  the old editions. Of course <i>atte</i> is rather, etymologically, a
  corruption of <i>at the</i>; Tyrwhitt probably means that the editors
  might as well have let the form <i>atte</i> stand. If so, he is quite
  right; for, though etymologically a corruption, it was a recognised form
  in the fourteenth century.</p>

  <p>621. This story immediately follows the one quoted from John of
  Salisbury in the note to l. 603. After 'societatem,' he
  proceeds:&mdash;'Regi quoque Demetrio, in opprobrium puerilis leuitatis,
  tali aurei a rege Parthorum dati sunt.' What Demetrius this was, we are
  not told; perhaps it may have been Demetrius Nicator, king of Syria, who
  was defeated and taken prisoner by the Parthians 138 <span class="sm">B.
  C.</span>, and detained in captivity by them for ten years. This,
  however, is but a guess. Compare the story told of our own king, in
  Shakespeare's Henry V, Act i. sc. 2.</p>

  <p>628. <i>To dryve the day awey</i>, to pass the time. The same phrase
  occurs in Piers Plowman, B. prol. 224, where it is said of the labourers
  who tilled the soil that they 'dryuen forth the longe day with <i>Dieu
  vous saue, Dame emme</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. amuse themselves with singing idle
  songs.</p>

  <p>633. In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. and Pt. is the quotation 'Nolite
  omnino iurare,' with a reference (in Hn. only) to Matt. v. The Vulgate
  version of Matt. v. 34 is&mdash;'Ego autem dico uobis, non iurare omnino,
  neque per caelum, quia thronus Dei est.'</p>

  <p>635. In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. Pt. is written&mdash;'Ieremie quarto
  Iurabis in veritate, in Iudicio, et Iusticia'; see Jer. iv. 2.</p>

  <p>There are several points of resemblance between the present passage
  and one in the Persones Tale (<i>De Ira</i>), I. 588-594, part of which
  has been already quoted in the note to l. 474. So also Wyclif: '&#x21D;it
  no man schulde swere, nouther for life ne dethe, no but with these thre
  condiciones, that is, in treuthe, in dome, and in rightwisenes, as God
  sais by the prophet Ieremye'; Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 483. Hence one of
  the 'olde bokes' mentioned in l. 630 is the Treatise by Frère Lorens from
  which the Persones Tale is largely taken.</p>

  <p>639. <i>the firste table</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the commandments that teach us our
  duty towards God; those in the second table teach us our duty to our
  neighbour.</p>

  <p>641. <i>seconde heste</i>, second commandment. Formerly, the first two
  commandments were considered as one; the third commandment was therefore
  the second, as here. The tenth commandment was divided into two parts, to
  make up the number. See Wyclif's treatise on 'The ten Comaundements';
  Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 82. Thus Wyclif says&mdash;'The secounde maner
  maundement of God perteyneth to the Sone. Thow schalt not take the name
  of thi Lord God in veyn, neþþer in word, neiþer in lyvynge.' So also in
  Hampole's Prose Treatises, ed. Perry, p. 10; Religious Pieces in Prose
  and Verse, ed. Perry (E. E. T. S.), pp. 5, 25. See note to l. 474; and
  cf. Pers. Tale, I. 588. <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>[284]</span></p>

  <p>643. <i>rather</i>, sooner; because this commandment precedes those
  which relate to murder, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>646. 'They that understand his commandments know this,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>649. Wyclif says&mdash;'For it is written in Ecclesiasticus, the thre
  and twenti chapitre, there he seith this: A man much sweringe schal be
  fulfilled with wickidnesse, and veniaunce schal not go away fro his
  hous'; Works, iii. 84. Chaucer here quotes the same text; see Ecclus.
  xxiii. 11. And he quotes it once more, in I. 593.</p>

  <p>651. So Wyclif, iii. 483&mdash;'hit is not leeful to swere by
  creaturis, ne by Goddys bonys, sydus, naylus, ne armus, or by ony membre
  of Cristis body, as þe moste dele of men usen.'</p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt says&mdash;'<i>his nayles</i>, i.&nbsp;e. with which he was nailed
  to the cross. Sir J. Maundeville, c. vii&mdash;"And thereby in the walle
  is the place where the 4 Nayles of our Lord weren hidd; for he had 2 in
  his hondes, and 2 in his feet: and one of theise the Emperoure of
  Constantynoble made a brydille to his hors, to bere him in bataylle; and
  thorgh vertue thereof he overcame his enemies," &amp;c. He had said
  before, c. ii., that "on of the nayles that Crist was naylled with on the
  cross" was "at Constantynoble; and on in France, in the kinges
  chapelle."'</p>

  <p>Mr. Wright adds, what is doubtless true, that these nails 'were
  objects of superstition in the middle ages.' Nevertheless, I am by no
  means satisfied that these comments are to the point. I strongly suspect
  that swearers did not stop to think, nor were they at all particular as
  to the sense in which the words might be used. Here, for example,
  <i>nails</i> are mentioned between <i>heart</i> and <i>blood</i>; in the
  quotation from Wyclif which begins this note, we find mention of 'bones,
  sides, nails, and arms,' followed by 'any member of Christ's body.' Still
  more express is the phrase used by William Staunton (see note to l. 474
  above) that 'God's members' include 'his nails.' On the other hand, in
  Lewis's Life of Pecock, p. 155 [or p. 107, ed. 1820], is a citation from
  a MS. to the effect that, in the year 1420, many men died in England
  'emittendo sanguinem per iuncturas et per secessum, scilicet in illis
  partibus corporis per quas horribiliter iurare consueuerunt, scilicet,
  per oculos Christi, per faciem Christi, per latera Christi, per sanguinem
  Christi, per cor Christi preciosum, per <i>clauos</i> Christi in suis
  manibus et pedibus.' See <i>'Snails</i> in Nares' Glossary. A long essay
  might be written upon the oaths found in our old authors, but the subject
  is, I think, a most repulsive one.</p>

  <p>652. Here Tyrwhitt notes&mdash;'The Abbey of Hailes, in
  Glocestershire, was founded by Richard, king of the Romans, brother to
  Henry III. This precious relick, which was afterwards called "the blood
  of Hailes," was brought out of Germany by the son of Richard, Edmund, who
  bestowed a third part of it upon his father's Abbey of Hailes, and some
  time after gave the other two parts to an Abbey of his own foundation at
  Ashrug near Berkhamsted.&mdash;Hollinshed, vol. ii. p. 275.' The Legend
  says that the holy blood was obtained by Titus from Joseph of Arimathea.
  Titus put it in the temple of Peace, in Rome. <!-- Page 285 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>[285]</span>Thence Charlemagne took
  half of it to Germany, where Edmund found it, as said above. The Legend
  is printed in Horstmann's Altenglische Legenden, p. 275. 'A vial was
  shewn at Hales in Glocestershire, as containing a portion of our blessed
  Saviour's blood, which suffered itself to be seen by no person in a state
  of mortal sin, but became visible when the penitent, by his offerings,
  had obtained forgiveness. It was now discovered that this was performed
  by keeping blood, which was renewed every week, in a vial, one side of
  which was thick and opaque, the other transparent, and turning it by a
  secret hand as the case required. A trick of the same kind, more
  skilfully executed, is still annually performed at
  Naples.'&mdash;Southey, Book of the Church, ch. xii. He refers to Fuller,
  b. vi. Hist. of Abbeys, p. 323; Burnet, i. 323, ed. 1681. See also the
  word <i>Hales</i> in the Index to the works published by the Parker
  Society; Pilgrimages to Walsingham and Canterbury (by Erasmus), ed. J. G.
  Nichols, 2nd ed. 1875, p. 88; Dodsley's Old Plays, ed. Hazlitt, i. 339,
  where a long account is given, with a reference to Hearne's ed. of
  Benedictus Abbas, ii. 751; and Skelton's Garland of Laurel, l. 1461, on
  which see Dyce's note.</p>

  <p>653. 'My chance is seven; yours is five and three.' This is an
  allusion to the particular game called <i>hazard</i>, not to a mere
  comparison of throws to see which is highest. A certain throw (here
  <i>seven</i>) is called the caster's <i>chance</i>. This can only be
  understood by an acquaintance with the rules of the game. See the article
  <i>Hazard</i> in Supplement to Eng. Cyclopaedia, or in Hoyle's Games. See
  the note to B. 124; and see the Monkes Tale, B. 3851. Compare&mdash;'Not
  unlyke the use of foule gamesters, who having lost the maine by [i.&nbsp;e.
  according to] true iudgement, thinke to face it out with a false oath';
  Lyly's Euphues and his England, ed. Arber, p. 289.</p>

  <p>656. In the Towneley Mysteries, p. 241, when the soldiers dice for
  Christ's garments, one says&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'I was falsly begyled withe thise <i>byched bones</i>,</p>
      <p style="margin-left:2.6em">Ther cursyd thay be.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The readings are:&mdash;E. Cp. <i>bicched</i>; Ln. <i>becched</i>; Hl.
  <i>bicched</i>; Hn. Cm. <i>bicche</i>; Pt. and old edd. <i>thilk</i>,
  <i>thilke</i> (wrongly). Besides which, Tyrwhitt cites <i>bichet</i>, MS.
  Harl. 7335; <i>becched</i>, Camb. Univ. Lib. Dd. 4. 24; and, from other
  MSS., <i>bicched</i>, <i>bicchid</i>, <i>bitched</i>, <i>bicche</i>. The
  general consensus of the MSS. and the quotation from the Towneley
  Mysteries establish the reading given in the text beyond all doubt. Yet
  Tyrwhitt reads <i>bicchel</i>, for which he adduces no authority beyond
  the following. '<i>Bickel</i>, as explained by Kilian, is <i>talus</i>,
  ovillus et lusorius; and <i>bickelen</i>, talis ludere. See also Had.
  Junii Nomencl. n. 213. Our dice indeed are the ancient <i>tesserae</i>
  (<span title="kuboi" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F7B;&beta;&omicron;&iota;</span>) not <i>tali</i> (<span
  title="astragaloi" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&#x1F71;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;</span>);
  but, both being games of hazard, the implements of one might be easily
  attributed to the other. It should seem from Junius, loc. cit., that the
  Germans had preserved the custom of playing with the natural bones, <!--
  Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>[286]</span>as
  they have different names for a game with <i>tali ovilli</i>, and another
  with <i>tali bubuli</i>.'</p>

  <p>I find in the Tauchnitz Dutch Dictionary&mdash;'<i>Bikkel</i>, cockal.
  <i>Bikkelen</i>, to play at cockals.' Here <i>cockal</i> is the old name
  for a game with four hucklebones (Halliwell), and is further made to mean
  the hucklebone itself. But there is nothing to connect <i>bicched</i>
  with Du. <i>bickel</i>, and the sense is very different. From the article
  on <i>Bicched</i> in the New Eng. Dict., it appears that the sense is
  'cursed, execrable,' and is an epithet applied to other things besides
  dice. It is evidently an opprobrious word, and seems to be derived from
  the sb. <i>bitch</i>, opprobriously used. There is even a quotation in
  which the verb <i>bitch</i> means to bungle or spoil a business. We may
  explain it by 'cursed bones.'</p>

  <p>662. <i>pryme</i>, about nine o'clock; see notes to A. 3906, B. 2015.
  Here it means the canonical hour for prayer so called, to announce which
  bells were rung.</p>

  sexton. See Rock, Church of Our Fathers, ii. 471; Grindal's Works, p.
  136; Myre's Instructions for Parish Priests, l. 1964.</p>

  <p>666. <i>That oon of them</i>, the one of them; the old phrase for 'one
  of them.' <i>knave</i>, boy.</p>

  <p>667. <i>Go bet</i>, lit. go better, i.&nbsp;e. go quicker; a term of
  encouragement to dogs in the chase. So in the Legend of Good Women, 1213
  (Dido, l. 290), we have&mdash;</p>

  <p>In Skelton's Elynour Rummyng, l. 332, we have&mdash;'And bad Elynour
  <i>go bet</i>.' Halliwell says&mdash;'<i>Go bet</i>, an old hunting cry,
  often introduced in a more general sense. See Songs and Carols, xv; Shak.
  Soc. Pap. i. 58; Chaucer, C.&nbsp;T. 12601 [the present passage]; Dido, 288
  [290]; Tyrwhitt's notes, p. 278; Ritson's Anc. Pop. Poetry, p. 46. The
  phrase is mentioned by [Juliana] Berners in the Boke of St. Alban's, and
  seems nearly equivalent to <i>go along</i>.' It is strange that no editor
  has perceived the <i>exact</i> sense of this very simple phrase. Cf.
  'Keep <i>bet</i> our good,' i.&nbsp;e. take better care of my property;
  Shipmannes Tale, B. 1622.</p>

  <p>679. <i>this pestilence</i>, during this plague. Alluding to the Great
  Plagues that took place in the reign of Edward III. There were four such,
  viz. in 1348-9, 1361-2, 1369, and 1375-6. As Chaucer probably had the
  story from an Italian source, the allusion must be to the first and worst
  of these, the effects of which spread nearly all over Europe, and which
  was severely felt at Florence, as we learn from the description left by
  Boccaccio. See my note to Piers Plowman, B. v. 13.</p>

  <p>684. <i>my dame</i>, my mother; as in H. 317; Piers Plowman, B. v.
  37.</p>

  <p>695. <i>avow</i>, vow; to <i>make avow</i> is the old phrase for <i>to
  vow</i>. Tyrwhitt alters it to <i>a vow</i>, quite unnecessarily; and the
  same alteration has been made by editors in other books, owing to want of
  familiarity <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page287"></a>[287]</span>with old MSS. It is true that the form
  <i>vow</i> does occur, as, e.&nbsp;g. in P. Plowm. B. prol. 71; but it is no
  less certain that <i>avow</i> occurs also, and was the older form; since
  we have <i>oon auow</i> (B. 334), and the phrase 'I make myn
  <i>avou</i>,' P. Plowman, A. v. 218; where no editorial sophistication
  can evade giving the right spelling. Equally clear is the spelling in the
  Prompt. Parv.&mdash;'<i>Avowe</i>, Votum. <i>Awowyn</i>, or <i>to make
  awowe</i>, Voveo.' And Mr. Way says&mdash;'<i>Auowe</i>, veu; Palsgrave.
  This word occurs in R. de Brunne, Wiclif, and Chaucer. The phrase
  "performed his auowe" occurs in the Legenda Aurea, fol. 47.' Those who
  are familiar with MSS. know that a prefixed <i>a</i> is often written
  apart from the word; thus the word now spelt <i>accord</i> is often
  written 'a corde'; and so on. Hence, even when the word is really
  <i>one</i> word, it is still often written 'a uow,' and is naturally
  printed <i>a vow</i> in two words, where no such result was intended.
  Tyrwhitt himself prints <i>min avow</i> in the Knightes Tale, A. 2237,
  and again <i>this avow</i> in the same, A. 2414; where no error is
  possible. See more on this word in my note to l. 1 of Chevy Chase, in
  Spec. of Eng. 1394-1579. I have there said that the form <i>vow</i> does
  not occur in early writers; I should rather have said, it is by no means
  the <i>usual</i> form.</p>

  <p>698. <i>brother</i>, i.&nbsp;e. sworn friend; see Kn. Tale, A. 1131, 1147.
  In l. 704, <i>yboren brother</i> means brother by birth.</p>

  <p>709. <i>to-rente</i>, tare in pieces, dismembered. See note to l. 474
  above.</p>

  <p>713. This 'old man' answers to the <i>romito</i> or hermit of the
  Italian text. Note <i>an old</i> (indefinite), as compared with <i>this
  oldë</i> (definite) in l. 714.</p>

  <p>715. Tyrwhitt, in his Glossary, remarks&mdash;'<i>God you see!</i>
  7751 [D. 2169]; <i>God him see!</i> 4576 [B. 156]. May God keep you, or
  him, in his sight! In Troilus, ii. 85, it is fuller<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>:&mdash;<i>God you save and see!</i>'
  Gower has&mdash;'And than I bidde, <i>God hir see!</i>' Conf. Amant. bk.
  iv. (ed. Chalmers, p. 116, col. 2, or ed. Pauli, ii. 96). In Grimm's
  Teutonic Mythology, ed. Stallybrass, i. 21, we find a similar phrase in
  O. H. German:&mdash;'daz si got iemer schouwe'; Iwain, l. 794. Cf. 'now
  loke the owre lorde!' P. Plowman, B. i. 207. See also l. 766 below.</p>

  <p>727. This is a great improvement upon the Italian Tale, which
  represents the hermit as <i>fleeing</i> from death. 'Fratelli miei, io
  fuggo la morte, che mi vien dietro cacciando mi.'</p>

  <p>Professor Kittredge, of Harvard University, informs me that ll.
  727-733 are imitated from the first Elegy of Maximian, of which ll. 1-4,

  </div>

  <p>Cf. Calderon, Les Tres Justicias en Una; Act ii. sc. 1.</p>

  <p>731. <i>leve moder</i>, dear mother Earth; see 'genetrix' above.</p>

  <p>734. <i>cheste.</i> Mr. Jephson (in Bell's edition) is puzzled here.
  He takes <i>cheste</i> to mean a coffin, which is certainly the sense in
  the Clerk's Prologue, E. 29. The simple solution is that <i>cheste</i>
  refers here, not to a coffin, but to the box for holding clothes which,
  in olden times, almost invariably stood in every bedroom, at the foot of
  the bed. 'At the foot of the bed there was usually an iron-bound hutch or
  locker, which served both as a seat, and as a repository for the apparel
  and wealth of the owner, who, sleeping with his sword by his side, was
  prepared to protect it against the midnight thief'; Our English Home, p.
  101. It was also called a coffer, a hutch, or an ark. The old man is
  ready, in fact, to exchange his chest, containing all his worldly gear,
  for a single hair-cloth, to be used as his shroud.</p>

  <p>743. In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. and Pt. is the quotation 'Coram
  canuto capite consurge,' from Levit. xix. 32. Hence we must understand
  <i>Agayns</i>, in l. 743, to mean <i>before</i>, or <i>in presence
  of</i>. Cf. B. 3702.</p>

  <p>748. <i>God be with you</i> is said, with probability, to have been
  the original of our modern unmeaning <i>Good bye!</i> <i>go or ryde</i>,
  a general phrase for locomotion; <i>go</i> here means <i>walk</i>. Cp.
  'ryde or go,' Kn. Tale, A. 1351. Cf. note to l. 866.</p>

  <p>771. The readings are:&mdash;E. Hn. Cm. <i>an .viij.</i>; Ln. <i>a
  .vij.</i>; Cp. Pt. Hl. <i>a seuen</i>. The word <i>eighte</i> is
  dissyllabic; cf. A.&nbsp;S. <i>eahta</i>, Lat. <i>octo</i>. <i>Wel ny an
  eighte busshels</i> = very nearly the quantity of eight bushels. The
  mention of <i>florins</i> is quite in keeping with the Italian character
  of the poem. Those coins were so named because originally coined at
  Florence, the first coinage being in 1252; note in Cary's Dante, Inferno,
  c. xxx. The expression 'floreyn of florence' occurs in The Book of
  Quintessence, ed. Furnivall, p. 6. The value of an English florin was
  6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; see note to Piers Plowman, B. ii. 143. There is an
  excellent note on <i>florins</i> in Thynne's Animadversions on Speght's
  Chaucer, ed. Furnivall, p. 45.</p>

  <p>781. In allusion to the old proverb&mdash;'Lightly come, lightly go.'
  Cotgrave, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Fleute</i>, gives the corresponding French proverb
  thus:&mdash;'Ce qui est venu par la fleute s'en retourne avec le
  tabourin; that the pipe hath gathered, the tabour scattereth; goods ill
  gotten are commonly ill spent.' In German&mdash;'wie gewonnen, so
  zerronnen.'</p>

  <p>782. <i>wende</i>, would have weened, would have supposed. It is the
  past tense subjunctive.</p>

  <p>790. <i>doon us honge</i>, lit. cause (men) to hang us; we should now
  say, cause us to be hanged. 'The Anglo-Saxons nominally punished theft
  with death, if above 12<i>d.</i> value; but the criminal could redeem
  <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page289"></a>[289]</span>his life by a ransom. In the 9th of Henry
  I. this power of redemption was taken away, 1108. The punishment of theft
  was very severe in England, till mitigated by Peel's Acts, 9 and 10 Geo.
  IV. 1829.'&mdash;Haydn, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Theft</i>.</p>

  <p>793. To <i>draw cuts</i> is to draw lots; see Prologue, 835, 838, 845.
  A number of straws were held by one of the company; the rest drew one
  apiece, and whoever drew the longest (or the shortest) was the one on
  whom the lot fell. The fatal straw was the <i>cut</i>; cf. Welsh
  <i>cwtws</i>, a lot. In France, the lot fell on him who drew the longest
  straw; so that their phrase was&mdash;'tirer la longue paille.'</p>

  <p>797. So in the Italian story&mdash;'rechi del pane e del vino,' let
  him fetch bread and wine.</p>

  <p>806-894. Here Chaucer follows the general sense of the Italian story
  rather closely, but with certain amplifications.</p>

  <p>807. <i>That oon</i>, the one; <i>that other</i>, the other (vulgarly,
  <i>the tother</i>).</p>

  <p>819. <i>conseil</i>, a secret; as in P. Plowman, B. v. 168. We still
  say&mdash;'to keep one's own counsel.'</p>

  <p>838. <i>rolleth</i>, revolves; cf. D. 2217, Troil. v. 1313.</p>

  <p>844. So the Italian story&mdash;'Il Demonio ... mise in cuore a
  costui,' &amp;c.; the devil put it in his heart; see vol. iii. p.
  441.</p>

  <p>848. <i>leve</i>, leave. 'That he had leave to bring him to
  sorrow.'</p>

  <p>851-878. Of this graphic description there is no trace in the Italian
  story as we now have it. Cf. Rom. and Juliet, v. 1.</p>

  <p>860. <i>al-so</i>, as. The sense is&mdash;as (I hope) God may save my
  soul. That our modern <i>as</i> is for <i>als</i>, which is short for
  <i>also</i>, from the A.&nbsp;S. <i>eall-swá</i>, is now well known. This fact
  was doubted by Mr. Singer, but Sir F. Madden, in his Reply to Mr.
  Singer's remarks upon Havelok the Dane, accumulated such a mass of
  evidence upon the subject as to set the question at rest for ever. It
  follows that <i>as</i> and <i>also</i> are doublets, or various spellings
  of the same word.</p>

  <p>865. <i>sterve</i>, die; A. S. <i>steorfan</i>. The cognate German
  <i>sterben</i> retains the old general sense. See l. 888 below.</p>

  <p>866. <i>goon a paas</i>, walk at an ordinary foot-pace; so also, <i>a
  litel more than paas</i>, a little faster than at a foot-pace, Prol. 825.
  Cotgrave has&mdash;'Aller le pas, to pace, or go at a foot-pace; to walk
  fair and softly, or faire and leisurely.' <i>nat but</i>, no more than
  only; cf. North of England <i>nobbut</i>. The time meant would be about
  twenty minutes at most.</p>

  <p>888. In the Italian story&mdash;'amendue caddero morti,' both of them
  fell dead; see vol. iii. p. 442.</p>

  <p>889. <i>Avicen</i>, Avicenna; mentioned in the Prologue, l. 432.
  Avicenna, or Ibn-Sina, a celebrated Arabian philosopher and physician,
  born near Bokhara <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 980, died <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1037. His chief work was a treatise on medicine
  known as the Canon ('Kitâb al-Kânûn fi'l-Tibb,' that is, 'Book of the
  Canon in Medicine'). This book, alluded to in the next line, is divided
  into books and sections; and the Arabic word for 'section' is in the
  Latin version denoted by <i>fen</i>, from the Arabic <i>fann</i>, a part
  of any science. Chaucer's expression is not quite <!-- Page 290 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>[290]</span>correct; he seems to
  have taken <i>canon</i> in its usual sense of rule, whereas it is really
  the title of the whole work. It is much as if one were to speak of
  Dante's work in the terms&mdash;'such as Dante never wrote in any Divina
  Commedia nor in any canto.' Lib. iv. Fen 1 of Avicenna's Canon treats 'De
  Venenis.'</p>

  <p>895. Against this line is written, in MS. E. only, the word 'Auctor';
  to shew that the paragraph contained in ll. 895-903 is a reflection by
  the author.</p>

  <p>897. The final <i>e</i> in <i>glutonye</i> is preserved by the
  caesural pause; but the scansion of the line is more easily seen by
  supposing it suppressed. Hence in order to scan the line, suppress the
  final <i>e</i> in <i>glutonye</i>, lay the accent on the second <i>u</i>
  in <i>luxúrie</i>, and slur over the final <i><span
  class="nw">-ie</span></i> in that word. Thus&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>O glút | oný' | luxú | r<i>ie</i> and hás | ardrýë ||</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>904. <i>good' men</i> is the common phrase of address to hearers in
  old homilies, answering to the modern 'dear brethren.' The Pardoner,
  having told his tale (after which Chaucer himself has thrown in a moral
  reflection), proceeds to improve his opportunity by addressing the
  audience in his usual professional style; see l. 915.</p>

  <p>907. <i>noble</i>, a coin worth 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, first coined by
  Edward III. about 1339. See note to P. Plowman, B. iii. 45.</p>

  <p>908. So in P. Plowman, B. prol. 75, it is said of the Pardoner that he
  'raughte with his ragman [bull] <i>rynges and broches</i>.'</p>

  <p>910. <i>Cometh</i> is to be pronounced <i>Com'th</i>, as in Prol. 839;
  so also in l. 925 below.</p>

  <p>920. <i>male</i>, bag; see Prol. 694. Cf. E. <i>mail-bag</i>.</p>

  <p>935. The first two syllables in <i>peravénture</i> are to be very
  rapidly pronounced; it is not uncommon to find the spelling
  <i>peraunter</i>, as in P. Plowman, B. xi. 10.</p>

  <p>937. <i>which a</i>, what sort of a, how great a, what a.</p>

  <p>945. <i>Ye, for a grote</i>, yea, even for a groat, i.&nbsp;e.
  4<i>d.</i></p>

  <p>946. <i>have</i> I, may I have; an imprecation.</p>

  <p>947. <i>so theech</i>, a colloquialism for <i>so thee ich</i>, as I
  may thrive, as I hope to thrive. The Host proceeds to abuse the
  Pardoner.</p>

  <p>951. This is a reference to the 'Invention of the Cross,' or finding
  of the true cross by St. Helen, the mother of Constantine; commemorated
  on May 3. See Chambers, Book of Days, i. 586; Alban Butler, Lives of the
  Saints.</p>

  <p>962. <i>right ynough</i>, quite enough; <i>right</i> is an adverb. Cf.
  l. 960.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">NOTES TO GROUP D.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Wife of Bath's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>There is nothing whatever to connect this Prologue with any preceding
  Tale. In MS. E. and most others, it follows the Man of Law's Tale, which
  cannot be right, as that Tale must be followed by the Shipman's Prologue.
  Curiously enough, that Prologue <i>does</i> follow the Man of Law's Tale
  in the Harleian MS., but the Wife of Bath's Tale is made to follow next,
  in place of the Shipman's Tale.</p>

  <p>In MS. Pt., and several others, the Wife's Prologue follows the
  Merchant's Tale; such is the arrangement in edd. 1532 and 1561. This is
  possible, as the Merchant's Tale ends a Fragment, and the Wife's Prologue
  begins one; but it is easier to fit the lines at the end of the
  Merchant's Tale to the Squire's Prologue. In the Royal MS. 18. C. 2, and
  in MSS. Laud 739 and Barlow 20, there is an attempt to introduce the
  Wife's Prologue by some spurious lines which are printed in vol. iii. p.
  446. I just note that we have a genuine Epilogue to the Merchant's Tale
  (see E. 2419-2440); which is quite enough to put the above lines out of
  court.</p>

  <p>MS. Ln. has a different arrangement. It gives eight spurious lines at
  the end of the Squire's Tale, and then four more spurious lines to link
  them with the Wife's Prologue; see vol. iii. p. 446.</p>

  <p>In the Ellesmere MS. there are numerous quotations in the margin, as
  will be noted in due course. In the Essays on Chaucer, pp. 293, the Rev.
  W. W. Woollcombe has shewn that the passages which seem to be taken from
  John of Salisbury are really taken from Jerome, whom John copied,
  verbally, at some length. I may add, that I came independently to the
  same conclusion; indeed, it becomes obvious, on investigation, that such
  was the case. Chaucer's chief sources for this Prologue are: Jerome's
  Epistle against Jovinian, and Le Roman de la Rose. I quote the former
  (frequently) from Hieronymi Opus Epistolarum, edited by Erasmus, printed
  at Basle in 1524.</p>

  <p>1. <i>auctoritee</i>, authoritative text, quotable statement of a good
  author. 'Though there were no written statement on the subject, my own
  experience would enable me to speak of the evils of marriage.' Cf. the
  <!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page292"></a>[292]</span>character of the Wife in the Prologue, A.
  445-476. Lines 1-3 are imitated from Le Rom. de la Rose, 13006-10.</p>

  <p>6. So in A. 460, with <i>she hadde</i> for <i>I have had</i>; see note
  to that line.</p>

  <p>7. The alternative reading (in the footnote) does not agree with l. 6.
  MS. E. is quite right here. Probably MS. Cm. would have given us the same
  reading, but it is here mutilated.</p>

  <p>11. In E., a sidenote has:&mdash;'In Cana Galilee'; from John, ii.
  1.</p>

  <p>12-13. In E., a sidenote has:&mdash;'Qui enim semel iuit ad nuptias,
  docuit semel esse nubendum.' This is from Hieronymi lib. i. c.
  Jovinianum; Epist. (ut supra), t. ii. p. 29. But the edition has
  <i>uenit</i> for <i>iuit</i>, and <i>semel docuit</i>.</p>

  <p>14-22. This also is from Jerome, as above (p. 28):&mdash;'Siquidem et
  illa in Euangelio Iohannis Samaritana, sextum se maritum habere dicens,
  arguitur a domino, quod non sit uir eius. Vbi enim numerus maritorum est,
  ibi uir, qui proprie unus est, esse desiit.' Cf. John, iv. 18.</p>

  <p>23-25. In the margin of E. we find:&mdash;'Non est uxorum numerus
  diffinitus.' About 15 lines after the last quotation, we find in
  Jerome:&mdash;'non esse uxorum numerum definitum.' This is immediately
  preceded (in Jerome) by a quotation from St. Paul (1 Cor. vii. 29), which
  is also quoted in the margin of E.</p>

  <p>28. In the margin of E.&mdash;'Crescite et multiplicamini'; Gen. i.
  28. The text was suggested by the fact that Jerome quotes it near the
  beginning of his letter (p. 18). Soon after (p. 19), he quotes Matt. xix.
  5, which Chaucer quotes accordingly in l. 31.</p>

  <p>33. <i>bigamye.</i> 'Bigamy, according to the canonists, consisted not
  only in marrying two wives at a time, but in marrying two spinsters
  successively.'&mdash;Bell.</p>

  <p><i>octogamye</i>, marriage of eight husbands. This queer word is due
  to Jerome, and affords clear proof of Chaucer's indebtedness. 'Non damno
  <i>digamos</i>, imò nec <i>trigamos</i>; et (si dici potest)
  <i>octogamos</i>'; p. 29. Cf. 'A dodecagamic Potter,' in a note to 'And a
  polygamic Potter,' in Shelley's Prologue to Peter Bell the Third.</p>

  <p>35. <i>here</i>, hear; a gloss in E. has 'audi.' See 1 Kings, xi.
  3.</p>

  <p>44. Tyrwhitt says that, after this verse, some MSS. (as Camb. Dd. 4.
  24, Ii. 3. 26, and Egerton 2726) have the six lines following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Of whiche I have pyked out the beste</p>
      <p>Both of here nether purs and of here cheste.</p>
      <p>Diverse scoles maken parfyt clerkes,</p>
      <p>And diverse practyk in many sondry werkes</p>
      <p>Maken the werkman parfyt sekirly;</p>
      <p>Of five husbondes scoleryng am I.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He adds&mdash;'if these lines are not Chaucer's, they are certainly
  more in his manner than the generality of the imitations of him. Perhaps
  he wrote them, and afterwards blotted them out. They come in but <!--
  Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page293"></a>[293]</span>awkwardly here, and he has used the
  principal idea in another place:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For sondry scoles maken sotil clerkes;</p>
      <p>Womman of many scoles half a clerk is'; E. 1427.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I beg leave to endorse Tyrwhitt's opinion; the six lines are certainly
  genuine, and I therefore repeat them, in a better spelling and form.</p>

  <p>I know of no other example of <i>scoler-ing</i>, i.&nbsp;e. young

  <p>46. In the margin of E. is here written&mdash;'Si autem non continent,
  nubant'; from 1 Cor. vii. 9.</p>

  <p>47. In the margin of E. is a quotation from Jerome, p. 28; but it is
  really from the Vulgate, 1 Cor. vii. 39; viz.&mdash;'Quod si dormierit
  uir eius, libera est; cui uult, nubat, tantum in Domino.' Cf. Rom. vii.
  3.</p>

  <p>51-52. Alluding to 1 Cor. vii. 28, and 1 Cor. vii. 9, here quoted in
  the margin of E.</p>

  <p>54. 'Primus Lamech sanguinarius et homicida, unam carnem in duas
  diuisit uxores'; Jerome (as above), p. 29, l. 1; partly quoted here in
  the margin of E. Cf. Gen. iv. 19-23. 'There runs through the whole of
  this doctrine about bigamy a confusion between marrying twice and having
  two wives at once.'&mdash;Bell. See the allusions to Lamech in F. 550,
  and Anelida, 150.</p>

  <p>55-56. In the margin of E. is:&mdash;'Abraham trigamus: Iacob
  quadrigamus.' Discussed by Jerome, p. 19, near the bottom.</p>

  <p>61. 'Ecce, inquit [Iouinianus], Apostolus profitetur de uirginibus
  Domini se non habere praeceptum; et qui cum autoritate de maritis et
  uxoribus iusserat, non audet imperare quod Dominus non praecepit....
  Frustra enim iubetur, quod in arbitrio eius ponitur cui iussum est';
  &amp;c.&mdash;Jerome (as above), p. 25.</p>

  <p>65. See 1 Cor. vii. 25, here quoted in the margin of E.</p>

  <p>69. 'Si uirginitatem Dominus imperasset, uidebatur nuptias condemnare,
  et hominum auferre seminarium, unde et ipsa uirginitas nascitur'; Jerome,
  p. 25.</p>

  <p>75. Tyrwhitt aptly quotes from Lydgate's Falls of Princes, fol.

  <p>We must conclude that a <i>dart</i> or <i>spear</i> was the prize
  given (in some games) to the best runner. That <i>dart</i> here means
  'prize,' appears from another proof altogether. For in the margin of E.
  we here find a quotation from Jerome, p. 26, which runs in a fuller form,
  thus:&mdash;'Proponit <span title="agônothetês" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&gamma;&omega;&nu;&omicron;&theta;&#x1F73;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>

  class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>[294]</span>uirginitatis
  <i>brauium</i>, ... et clamitat, ... qui potest capere, capiat.' The word
  <i>brauium</i>, i.&nbsp;e. prize in a race, is borrowed from the Vulgate, 1
  Cor. ix. 24, where the Greek has <span title="brabeion" class="grk"
  >&beta;&rho;&alpha;&beta;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&nu;</span>. 'Catch
  who so may,' in l. 76, represents 'qui potest capere, capiat.' Hence
  <i>cacche</i> here means 'win.'</p>

  <p>81. Alluding to 1 Cor. vii. 7, here quoted in E.</p>

  <p>84. 'Haec autem dico secundum indulgentiam'; 1 Cor. vii. 6.</p>

  <p>87. Alluding to 1 Cor. vii. 1, here quoted in E.</p>

  <p>89. <i>tassemble</i>, for <i>to assemble</i>, to bring together.</p>

  <p>Cf. 'qui ignem tetigerit, statim aduritur,' &amp;c.&mdash;Jerome, p.
  21.</p>

  <p>91. Cf. 'Simulque considera, quod aliud donum uirginitatis sit, aliud
  nuptiarum'; Jerome (as above), ii. 22.</p>

  <p>96. <i>preferre</i> is evidently a neuter verb here, meaning 'be
  preferable to.'</p>

  <p>101. <i>tree</i>, wood; alluding to 2 Tim. ii. 20.</p>

  <p>103. <i>a propre yifte</i>, a gift peculiar to him; see 1 Cor. vii. 7,
  here quoted in E.</p>

  <p>105. See Rev. xiv. 1-4, a line or two from which is here quoted in
  E.</p>

  <p>110. <i>fore</i>, track, course, footsteps; glossed 'steppes' in MS.
  E. Some MSS. have the inferior <i>lore</i>, shewing that the scribes
  understood the word no better than the writer of the note in Bell's
  Chaucer, who says&mdash;'Harl. MS. reads <i>fore</i>, which is probably a
  mere clerical error.' Wright, however, correctly retains <i>fore</i>. It
  occurs again in D. 1935, q. v., where Tyrwhitt again alters it to
  <i>lore</i>. Bradley gives ten examples of it, to which I can add
  another, viz. 'he folowede the <i>fore</i> of an oxe,' Trevisa, ii. 343
  (repeated from the example in i. 197, which Bradley cites). A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>f&#x14D;r</i>, a course, way; from <i>faran</i> (pt. t.
  <i>f&#x14D;r</i>), to go. Cf. Matt. xix. 21, which is quoted in Cp. and
  Pt.</p>

  <p>115. 'Et cur, inquies, creata sunt genitalia, et sic a conditore
  sapientissimo fabricati sumus, &amp;c. ... ipsa organa ... sexus
  differentiam praedicant'; Jerome (as above), p. 42.</p>

  <p>117. I give the reading of E., which seems much the best. For
  <i>wight</i>, Cm. has <i>wyf</i>. Hn. <i>has</i>: And of so p<i>ar</i>fit
  wys a wight y-wroght; which is also good. But Cp. Pt. Ln. <i>have</i>:
  And of so parfyt wise and why y-wrought. Hl. <i>has</i>: And in what wise
  was a wight y-wrought. The last reading is the worst.</p>

  <p>128. <i>ther</i>, where, wherein. With l. 130, cf. 1 Cor. vii. 3,
  where the Vulgate has 'Uxori uir debitum reddat.'</p>

  <p>135. 'Nunquam ergo cessemus a libidine, ne frustra huiuscemodi membra
  portemus'; Jerome, p. 42.</p>

  <p>144. <i>hoten</i>, be called; A. S. <i>h&#x101;tan</i>. The sense
  is&mdash;'Let virgins be as bread made of selected wheaten flour; and let
  us wives be called barley-bread; nevertheless Jesus refreshed many a man
  with barley-bread, as St. Mark tells us.' Chaucer makes a slight mistake;
  it is St. John who speaks of <i>barley</i><span
  class="nw">-loaves;</span> see John vi. 9 (cf. Mark vi. 38). For
  <i>hoten</i>, Tyrwhitt, Wright, Bell, and Morris, all give the mistaken
  reading <i>eten</i>, which misses the whole point of the argument; but
  <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page295"></a>[295]</span>Gilman has <i>hoten</i>. There is no
  question as to what the Wife should <i>eat</i>, but only as to her
  condition in life. It is the Wife herself who is compared to something
  edible.</p>

  <p>The comparison is from Jerome (as above), p. 21:&mdash;'Velut si quis
  definiat: Bonum est <i>triticeo</i> pane uesci, et edere <i>purissimam
  similam</i>. Tamen ne quis compulsus fame stercus bubulum: concedo ei, ut
  uescatur et <i>hordeo</i>.'</p>

  <p>147. Alluding to 1 Cor. vii. 20, here quoted in E.</p>

  <p>151. <i>daungerous</i>, difficult of access; cf. l. 514.</p>

  <p>155. In the margin of E.&mdash;'Qui uxorem habet, et <i>debitor</i>
  dicitur, et esse in praeputio, et <i>seruus</i> uxoris,' &amp;c. From
  Jerome (as above), p. 26.</p>

  <p>156. Alluding to 1 Cor. vii. 28, here quoted in E.</p>

  <p>158. Alluding to 1 Cor. vii. 4, here quoted in E.</p>

  <p>161. Alluding to Eph. v. 25, here quoted in E.</p>

  <p>167-168. <i>What</i>, why. <i>to-yere</i>, this year; cf.
  <i>to-day</i>. 'To-yere, <i>horno</i>, <i>hornus</i>, <i>hornotinus</i>';
  Catholicon Anglicum. The phrase is still in use in some of our
  dialects.</p>

  <p>170. <i>another tonne.</i> This expression is probably due to Le Roman
  de la Rose, 6839:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Jupiter en toute saison</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This again is from Homer's two urns, sources of good and evil (Iliad,
  xxiv. 527), as quoted by Boethius, bk. ii. pr. 2. See note in vol. ii. p.
  428 (l. 53). It is suggested that the Pardoner has been used to a tun of
  ale, and now he must expect to have a taste of something less pleasant.
  Cf. l. 177.</p>

  <p>One of Gower's French Balades contains the lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Deux tonealx ad [Cupide] dont il les gentz fait boire;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>180. The saying referred to is written in the margin of Dd., as
  Tyrwhitt tells us. It runs:&mdash;'Qui per alios non corrigitur, alii per
  ipsum corrigentur.' With regard to its being written in Ptolemy's
  Almagest, Tyrwhitt quaintly remarks:&mdash;'I suspect that the Wife of
  Bath's copy of Ptolemy was very different from any that I have been able
  to meet with.' The same remark applies to her second quotation in l. 326
  below. I have no doubt that the Wife is simply copying, for convenience,
  these words in Le Roman de la Rose, 7070:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Car nous lisons de Tholomee</p>
      <p>Une parole moult honeste</p>
      <p>Au comencier de s'Almageste,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Jean de Meun then cites a passage of quite another kind, but the Wife
  of Bath did not stick at such a trifle. The Almagest is mentioned again
  in the same, l. 18772. <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page296"></a>[296]</span></p>

  <p>As to the above saying, cf. Barbour's Bruce, i. 121, 2; and my notes
  to the line at pp. 545 and 612 of the same. 'Felix quem faciunt aliena
  pericula cautum'; cf. Rom. de la Rose, 8041; Robert of Brunne, Handlyng
  Synne, 8086.</p>

  <p>183. <i>Almageste.</i> The celebrated astronomer, Claudius Ptolemaeus,
  who flourished in the second century, wrote, as his chief work, the <span
  title="megalê suntaxis tês astronomias" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&#x1F71;&lambda;&eta;
  &sigma;&#x1F7B;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&xi;&iota;&sigmaf; &tau;&#x1FC6;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F00;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&#x1F77;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>.
  This work was also called, for brevity, <span title="megalê" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&#x1F71;&lambda;&eta;</span>, and afterwards <span
  title="megistê" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&#x1F77;&sigma;&tau;&eta;</span> (greatest); out of
  which, by prefixing the Arab. article <i>al</i>, the Arabs made
  <i>Al-mejisti</i>, or <i>Al-magest</i>.</p>

  <p>197. Here <i>wér-e</i> is made dissyllabic. For <i>The three</i>, Hl.
  has <i>Tuo</i>; which is clearly wrong.</p>

  <p>199. In the margin of E. is written part of the last sentence in Part
  I. of Jerome's treatise:&mdash;'hierophantas quoque Atheniensium usque
  hodie cicutae sorbitione castrari; et postquam in pontificatum fuerint
  electi, uiros esse desinere.' Probably quoted to emphasize the sense of
  <i>uiros</i>.</p>

  <p>207-210. Imitated from Le Rom. de la Rose, 13478-82.</p>

  <p>218. <i>Dunmowe</i>, in Essex, N. W. of Chelmsford. Tyrwhitt refers us
  to Blount's Ancient Tenures, p. 162, and adds:&mdash;'This whimsical
  institution was not peculiar to Dunmow; there was the same in Bretagne.
  "A l'Abbaie Sainct Melaine, près Rennes, y a, plus de six cens ans sont,
  un costé de lard encore tous frais et non corrumpu; et neantmoins voué et
  ordonné aux premiers, qui par an et jour ensemble mariez ont vescut san
  debat, grondement, et sans s'en repentir."&mdash;<i>Contes d'Eutrap</i>,
  t. ii. p. 161.' See P. Plowman, C. xi. 276, and my long note on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>220. <i>fawe</i>, fain; a variant form of <i>fain</i>, A. S.
  <i>fægen</i>, <i>fægn</i>. See Havelok, 2160; Alisaunder, ed. Weber,
  1956; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>221. Here occurs the first reference to the <i>Aureolus Liber de
  Nuptiis</i>, written by a certain Theophrastus, who is mentioned below
  (l. 671), and in E. 1310. Jerome gives a long extract from this work in
  his book against Jovinian (so frequently cited above), and has thus
  preserved a portion of it; and John of Salisbury transferred the whole
  extract bodily to his Policraticus. It it clear that Chaucer used the
  work of Jerome rather than that of John of Salisbury. The extract from
  Theophrastus occurs not far from the end of the first book of the epistle
  against Jovinian; and near the beginning of it occur the words&mdash;'de
  foro ueniens quid attulisti?'&mdash;Jerome (as above), p. 51. This
  probably suggested the present line, as it is a question put by a wife to
  her husband.</p>

  <p>226. <i>and bere hem</i>, i.&nbsp;e. and wrongly accuse them, or make them
  believe.</p>

  <p>227. Tyrwhitt quotes two corresponding lines from Le Roman de la
  Rose:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Car plus hardiment que nulz homs</p>
      <p>Certainement jurent et mentent.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He refers to l. 19013; but in Méon's edition, these are ll. 18336-7.
  <!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page297"></a>[297]</span></p>

  <p>229. Cf. Le Rom. de la Rose, 9949:&mdash;'Ce ne di-ge pas por les
  bonnes.'</p>

  <p>231. <i>wys</i>, cunning. In MSS. E. and Hn. the caesural pause is
  marked after <i>wyf</i>. The line, as it stands, is imperfect, and only
  to be scanned by making the pause after <i>wyf</i> occupy the space of a
  syllable. The reading <i>wys-e</i> gets over the difficulty, but is
  hardly what we should expect; it is remarkable that E. Hn. and Cm. all
  read <i>wys</i>, without a final <i>e</i>; cf. <i>wys</i> in A. 68, 785,
  851. The only justification of the form <i>wys-e</i> would be to consider
  it as feminine; and such seems to be the case in Gower, Conf. Am., ed.
  Pauli, i. 156:&mdash;'His doughter <i>wis-e</i> Petronel-le.' <i>if that
  she can hir good</i>, if she knows what is to her advantage.</p>

  <p>232. 'Will make him believe that the chough is mad.' In the New E.
  Dict., s.&nbsp;v. <i>Chough</i>, Dr. Murray shews that the various readings
  <i>cou</i>, <i>cowe</i>, <i>kowe</i>, &amp;c. tend to prove that
  <i>cow</i> in this passage may well mean 'chough' or 'jackdaw' rather
  than 'cow.' This solves the difficulty; for the allusion is clearly to
  one of the commonest of medieval stories, told of various talking birds,
  originally of a parrot.</p>

  <p>Very briefly, the story runs thus. A jealous husband, leaving his
  wife, sets his parrot to watch her. On his return, the bird reports her
  misconduct. But the wife avers that the parrot lies, and tries to prove
  it by an ingenious stratagem. The husband believes his frail wife's plot,
  and promptly wrings the bird's neck for telling stories, under the
  impression that it has gone mad.</p>

  <p>I formerly explained this in The Academy, April 5, 1890, p. 239. In
  the no. for April 19, p. 269, Mr. Clouston referred me to his paper on
  'The Tell-tale Bird' printed in the Chaucer Society's Originals and
  Analogues, p. 439, with reference to the Manciple's Tale, which relates a
  similar story. See the account of the Manciple's Tale in vol. iii. p.
  501. It is the story of the Husband and the Parrot, in the Arabian
  Nights' Entertainment.</p>

  <p>This line of Chaucer's seems to have attracted attention, though there
  is nothing to shew how it was understood. Thus, in Roy's <i>Rede me and
  be nott Wrothe</i>, ed. Arber, p. 80, we find:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Because they canne flatter and lye,</p>
      <p>Makynge beleve <i>the cowe is wode</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Awdelay's Fraternyte of Vacabondes (E. E. T. S.), p. 14, we find:
  'Gyle Hather is he, that wyll stand by his Maister when he is at dinner,
  and byd him beware that he eate no raw meate, because he would eate it
  himself. This is a pickthanke knaue, that would make his Maister beleue
  that <i>the Cowe is woode</i>.' Palsgrave, in his French Dictionary, p.
  421, has:&mdash;'I am borne in hande of a thyng; <i>On me faict a
  croyre</i>. He wolde beare me in hande the kowe is woode; <i>il me veult
  fayre a croyre de blanc que ce soit noyr</i>.' The spelling <i>coe</i>
  for 'jackdaw' occurs in Skelton's Phyllyp Sparowe, l. 468. See also
  Hoccleve's Works, ed. Furnivall, p. 217, where 'Magge, the good kowe' is
  <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>[298]</span>an obvious error for 'Magge the wode
  kowe,' since 'Magge' is a name for a <i>mag</i><span
  class="nw">-pie.</span> This I also explained in The Academy, April 1,
  1893, p. 285.</p>

  <p>233. 'And she will take witness, of her own maid, of her (the maid's)
  assent (to her truth).' This is part of the proof of the correctness of
  the interpretation of the preceding line. For, in most of the versions of
  the tale above referred to, the lady is aided and abetted by a maid who
  is in her confidence.</p>

  <p>235. Here Chaucer takes several hints from the book of Theophrastus as
  quoted by Jerome; see note to l. 221. Thus (in Jerome, as above, p. 51)
  we find:&mdash;'Deinde per noctes totas garrulae
  conquestiones:&mdash;Illa ornatior procedit in publicum; haec honoratior
  ab omnibus: ego in conuentu feminarum misella despicior. Cur aspiciebas
  uicinam? Quid cum ancillula loquebaris?' It is continued at l. 243; cf.
  'Non amicum habere possumus, non sodalem.' Next, at l. 248; cf. 'Pauperem
  alere difficile est, diuitem ferre tormentum.' Next, at l. 253; cf.
  'Pulchra cito adamatur.... Difficile custoditur quod plures amant.' Jean
  de Meun also quotes from Theophrastus plentifully, mentioning him by name
  in Le Rom. de la Rose, l. 8599; see the whole passage. '<i>Caynard</i>,
  obsolete, adapted from F. <i>cagnard</i>, sluggard (according to Littré,
  from Ital. <i>cagna</i>, bitch, fem. of <i>cane</i>, dog). A lazy fellow,
  a sluggard; a term of reproach. (1303) Rob. of Brunne, Handlyng Synne, l.
  8300: A <i>kaynarde</i> ande an olde folte [misprinted folle]. (About
  1310) in Wright's Lyric Poems, xxxix. 110 (1842): This croked
  <i>caynard</i>, sore he is a-dred.'&mdash;New Eng. Dict. (where the
  present passage is also quoted).</p>

  <p>246. See A. 1261, and the note. Wright here adds two more examples. He
  says&mdash;'In the satirical poem of Doctor Double-ale, [in Hazlitt's
  Early Pop. Poetry, iii. 308], we have the lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Then seke another house,</p>
      <p>This is not worth a louse;</p>
      <p><i>As dronken as a mouse</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Among the Letters relating to the Suppression of Monasteries (Camden
  Soc.), p. 133, there is one from a monk of Pershore, who says that his
  brother monks of that house "drynk an bowll after collacyon tell ten or
  xii. of the clock, and cum to mattens <i>as dronck as mys</i>."'</p>

  <p>248. See note to l. 235 above; so again, for l. 253, cf. Le Rom. de la
  Rose, 8617-8638.</p>

  <p>255. Cf. Ovid, Heroid. xvi. 288:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Lis est cum forma magna pudicitiae.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>257. Probably Chaucer was thinking of a passage in Theophrastus,
  following soon after that quoted in the note to l. 235. 'Alius forma,
  alius ingenio, alius facetiis, alius liberalitate sollicitat.' But
  Theophrastus is referring to the accomplishments of the wooers rather
  than of the women wooed. Cf. Le Rom. de la Rose, ll. 8629-36&mdash;'S'ele
  est bele,' &amp;c. <!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page299"></a>[299]</span></p>

  <p>263. Clearly from Le Rom. de la Rose, l. 8637&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Car tor de toutes pars assise</p>
      <p>Envis eschape d'estre prise.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>265. Immediately after, we have&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'S'ele rest lede, el vuet à tous plaire;</p>
      <p>... vuet tous ceus qui la voient.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>269. See in Hazlitt's Proverbs: 'Joan's as good as my lady in the
  dark.'</p>

  <p>271. 'It is a hard matter to control a thing that no one would
  willingly keep.' Simply translated from Theophrastus (see note to l.
  235), who has&mdash;'Molestum est possidere, quod nemo habere
  dignetur.'</p>

  <p>272. <i>helde</i>, a variant form of <i>holde</i>, hold, keep; from A.
  S. <i>healdan</i>. As Chaucer usually has <i>holde</i> (see D. 1144),
  <i>helde</i> is probably used for the sake of the rime. Note that it is
  the <i>only</i> example of a rime in <i><span class="nw">-elde</span></i>
  in the whole of the Canterbury Tales; indeed, the only other example is
  in Troil. ii. 337-8. We find the same rime in King Horn, l.
  911:&mdash;</p>

  <p>275. Again from Theophrastus (near the beginning):&mdash;'Non est ergo
  uxor ducenda sapienti. Primum enim impediri studia philosophiae,'
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>277. <i>welked</i>, withered; see C. 738, and Stratmann.</p>

  <p>278. Chaucer quotes this, as from Solomon, in the Pers. Tale, I. 631,
  and explains it there more fully; and again, in the Tale of Melibeus, B.
  2276. An Anglo-French poet named Herman wrote a poem 'on the three words,
  smoke, rain, and woman, which, according to Solomon, drive a man from his
  house; and it appears from the poem that it was composed at the
  suggestion of Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, who died in 1147.'&mdash;T.
  Wright, Biographia Brit. Literaria, Anglo-Norman Period, p. 333. See also
  my note to P. Plowman, C. xx. 297, quoted in the note to B. 2276 above,
  at p. 207.</p>

  <p>282. This again is from Theophrastus (see note to l. 235):&mdash;'Si
  iracunda, si fatua, si deformis, si superba, si foetida; quodcunque uitii
  est, post nuptias discimus.'</p>

  <p>285. Immediately after the last quotation there follows:&mdash;'Equus,
  asinus, bos, canis, et uilissima mancipia, uestes quoque et lebetes,
  sedile lignum, calix et urceolus fictilis probantur prius, et sic
  emuntur: sola uxor non ostenditur, ne ante displiceat, quàm ducatur.'</p>

  <p>293. Next follows:&mdash;'Attendenda semper eius est facies, et
  pulchritudo laudanda.... Vocanda "domina," celebrandus natalis eius, ...
  honoranda nutrix eius, et gerula, seruus, patrimus, et alumnus,' &amp;c.
  Cf. Le Rom. de la Rose, 13914.</p>

  <p>303-306. Next follows:&mdash;'et formosus assecla, et procurator
  calamistratus, et in longam securamque libidinem exectus spado: sub
  quibus nominibus adulteri delitescunt.'</p>

  <p>Chaucer has merely taken the general idea, and given it a form
  peculiarly adapted to his sketch. That he really <i>was</i> thinking of
  this <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page300"></a>[300]</span>passage is clear from the fact that, in
  the margin of E., appears this note&mdash;'Et procurator

  <p>311. <i>of our dame</i>, of the mistress, i.&nbsp;e. of myself.</p>

  <p>322. <i>at our large</i>, free, at large; we now drop <i>our</i>. Cf.

  <p>325. See notes to ll. 180, 183. We need not search in Ptolemy for this
  saying.</p>

  <p>327. <i>who hath the world in honde</i>, i.&nbsp;e. who has abundant
  wealth. Cf. l. 330. The sense of the proverb is, that the wisest man is
  he who is contented, who cares nothing that others are much richer than
  himself. Cf. 1 Tim. vi. 6, 8; and the proverb&mdash;'Content is all.' In
  the margin of E. is written the Latin form of the saying:&mdash;'Inter
  omnes altior existit, qui non curat in cuius manu sit mundus.'</p>

  <p>333. <i>werne</i>, forbid, refuse. The idea is from Le Roman de la
  Rose, l. 7447:&mdash;</p>

  <p>It was quite a proverbial phrase, as the last line shews. It occurs,
  for example, in Alexander and Dindimus, ed. Skeat, l. 233, and in the
  original Latin text of the same. Duke Francesco Maria della Rovere used
  the device of 'a lighted candle, by which others are lighted, with the
  motto <i>Non degener addam</i>'; i.&nbsp;e. I will add without
  loss.&mdash;Mrs. Palliser, Historic Devices, p. 263. Cicero (De Officiis,

  <p>342. From 1 Tim. ii. 9, here quoted in the margin of E.</p>

  <p>350. <i>his</i>, its. The pronoun is here neuter, and is the same in
  all the MSS. Tyrwhitt altered it to <i>hire</i> (her), but needlessly.
  But in l. 352, the sex of the cat is defined. As to the singed cat,
  'that, as they say, does not like to roam,' see The Exempla of Jacques de
  Vitry, ed. Crane, (Folk Lore Soc.), 1890, pp. 219, 241.</p>

  <p>354. <i>goon a-caterwawed</i>, go a-caterwauling. I explain the suffix
  <i><span class="nw">-ed</span></i> as put for <i><span
  class="nw">-eth</span></i>, A.&nbsp;S. <i><span class="nw">-að</span></i>, as
  in <i>on huntað</i>, a-hunting; where <i><span class="nw">-að</span></i>
  is a substantival suffix. I have given several examples of this curious
  substitution in the note to C. 406, q.&nbsp;v. Cotgrave has: '<i>Aller à
  gars</i>, to hunt after lads; (a wench) to go a caterwawling.' And see
  <i>Caterwaul</i> in the New Eng. Dict.</p>

  <p>As to Argus, see Ovid, Met. i. 625.</p>

  <p>362. Here Chaucer again quotes largely from Hieronymus c. Iouinianum,
  lib. ii.; in Epist. (Basil. 1524), ii. 36, 37. Many of the passages are
  cited from the Vulgate, but they are all found in this treatise of
  Jerome's, which furnishes the real key. Jerome says:&mdash;'Per tria
  mouetur terra, quartum autem non potest ferre; si seruus regnet, et
  stultus si saturetur panibus, et <i>odiosa uxor</i> (see l. 366) si
  habeat bonum uirum, et ancilla si eiciat dominam suam. Ecce et hic inter
  malorum magnitudinem uxor ponitur'; p. 37. Really quoted from Prov. xxx.
  21-23.</p>

  <p>371. Again from Jerome, p. 37: 'Infernus, et amor mulieris, et terra
  quae non satiatur aqua, et ignis non dicit "satis est."' Really from
  Prov. xxx. 16, where the A.&nbsp;V. has 'the grave' instead of 'hell.' Note
  that Jerome here has <i>amor mulieris</i>, though the Vulgate has <i>os
  uuluae</i>. The passage is quoted in E., with <i>dicent</i> for
  <i>dicit</i>.</p>

  <p>373. <i>wylde fyr</i>, wild fire; i.&nbsp;e. fiercely burning fire,
  probably with reference to lighted naphtha or the like. Chaucer again
  uses the term in the Pers. Tale, I. 445. Greek fire was of a like
  character. In the Romance of Rich. Coer de Lion, l. 2627, we
  find:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>The see brent all off <i>fyr Gregeys</i>.'</p>
    </div>

  <p>Thus the Greek fire, at any rate, was not quenched by the sea. See La
  Chimie an moyen âge, par M. Berthelot, p. 100.</p>

  <p>376. From Jerome (p. 36):&mdash;'Sicut in ligno uermis, ita perdit
  uirum suum uxor malefica.' Quoted in the margin of E., with <i>perdet</i>
  for <i>perdit</i>. Cf. 'Sicut ... uermis ligno,' Prov. xxv. 20 (Vulgate);
  not in the A.&nbsp;V.</p>

  <p>378. Jerome has (p. 39):&mdash;'Nemo enim melius scire potest quid sit
  uxor uel mulier, illo qui passus est.' (Quoted in E.)</p>

  <p>386. <i>byte and whyne</i>, i.&nbsp;e. both bite (when in a bad temper) and
  whine or whinny as if wanting a caress (when in a good one). It is made
  clearer by the parallel line in Anelida, l. 157, on which see my note in
  vol. i. p. 535.</p>

  <p>389. Cf. our proverb&mdash;'first come, first served.' Hazlitt quotes
  the medieval Lat. proverb&mdash;'Ante molam primus qui venit, non molat
  imus.' And Mr. Wright quotes the French proverb of the fifteenth
  century&mdash;'Qui premier vient au moulin premier doit mouldre.'
  Cotgrave, s. v. <i>Mouldre</i>, has the same; with <i>arrive</i> for
  <i>vient</i>, and <i>le premier</i> for <i>premier</i>.</p>

  <p>392. <i>hir lyve</i>, i.&nbsp;e. during their (whole) life. With ll. 393-6,

  <p>406. <i>grucching</i>, grumbling; mod. E. <i>grudge</i>. Hl. has

  in st. 2 of a poem with the burden&mdash;'Lyk thyn audience, so utter thy
  langage'; see Polit., Relig., and Love Poems, ed. Furnivall, p. 25, l.

  <p>418. Cf. l. 417. Bacon was considered as a common food for rustics.
  Cf. 'bacon-fed knaves'; 1 Hen. IV. ii. 2. 88. It is not worth while to
  discuss the matter further.</p>

  <p>430. <i>conclusioun</i>, purpose, aim, object.</p>

  <p>432. <i>Wilkin</i> was evidently, like <i>Malle</i> or <i>Malkin</i>,
  a name for a pet lamb or sheep; see B. 4021. In this line (if
  <i>mekely</i> be trisyllabic, and <i>lok'th</i> monosyllabic), the word
  <i>our-e</i> is dissyllabic, which is not common in Chaucer.</p>

  <p>433. <i>ba</i>, kiss; see note to A. 3709.</p>

  <p>460. This story is from Valerius Maximus; Pliny tells it of one
  <i>Mecenius</i>. In the margin of E., the reference is exactly given,
  viz. to 'Valerius, lib. 6. cap. 3,' which is quite right. I quote the
  passage: 'Egnatii autem Metelli longe minori de caussa; qui uxorem, quod
  vinum bibisset, fuste percussam interemit. Idque factum non accusatore
  tantum, sed etiam reprehensore caruit; unoquoque existimante, optimo
  illam exemplo violatae sobrietatis poenas pependisse.'&mdash;Valerii
  Maximi lib. vi. c. 3. Cf. Pliny, xiv. 13; Tertullian, Apologeticus, 6.
  Chaucer twice quotes again the <i>same</i> chapter; see notes to ll. 642,
  647.</p>

  <p>464. <i>moste I thinke</i>, I must (needs) think. For <i>moste</i>,

  <p>These lines form part of the speech of <i>La Vieille</i>, on whom the

  <p>483. <i>Ioce</i>, in Latin <i>Judocus</i>, a Breton saint, whose day
  is Dec. 13, and who died in <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 669. Alban
  Butler says that his hermitage became a famous monastery, which stood in
  the diocese of Amiens, and was called St. Josse-sur-mer. This part of
  France became familiar to many Englishmen in the course of the wars of
  Edward III. See, however, Le Testament de Jean de Meung, 461-4, which I
  take to mean:&mdash;'When dame Katherine sees the proof of <i>Sir
  Joce</i>, who cares not a prune for his wife's love, she is so fearful
  that her own husband will do her a like harm, that she often makes for
  him a staff of a similar bit of wood'; F. 'Si li refait sovent d'autel
  fust une croce.' It is obvious that Chaucer has copied this in l. 484,
  and that he here found his rime to <i>croce</i>.</p>

  <p>484. 'I made a stick for him of the same wood'; i.&nbsp;e. I retaliated by
  rousing his jealousy; compare the last note. <i>Croce</i>, a staff, O.&nbsp;F.
  <i>croce</i>, F. <i>crosse</i>; see <i>Croche</i> in the New E.
  Dictionary. Cf. Prompt. Parv., p. 103, note 5; and my note to P. Plowm.
  C. xi. 92.</p>

  <p>487. In Hazlitt's Proverbs is given&mdash;'To fry in his own grease,'
  from Heywood; it is explained to mean 'to be very passionate,' but means
  rather 'to torment oneself.' He also quotes, from Heywood:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'She fryeth in hir owne grease, but as for my parte,</p>

  <p>492. The story is given by Jerome, in the treatise so often quoted
  above. 'Legimus quendam apud Romanos nobilem, cum eum amici arguerent
  quare uxorem formosam et castam et diuitem repudiasset, protendisse
  pedem, et dixisse eis: Et hic soccus quem cernitis, uidetur uobis nouus
  et elegans, sed nemo scit praeter me ubi me premat.'&mdash;Hieron. c.
  Iouinianum, lib. i.: Epist. ii. 52 (Basil. 1524). John of Salisbury has
  the same story, almost in the same words, but gives the name of the noble
  Roman, viz. P. Cn. Graecinus. See his Policraticus, lib. v. c. 10.
  Chaucer alludes to it again below, in E. 1553.</p>

  <p>495. She went thrice to Jerusalem; see A. 463.</p>

  <p>496. 'Across the arch which usually divides the chancel from the nave
  in English churches was stretched a <i>beam</i>, on which was placed a
  <i>rood</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a figure of our Lord on the cross.'&mdash;Bell.</p>

  <p>498. In the margin of E. is the note:&mdash;'Appelles fecit mirabile
  opus <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>[304]</span>in tumulo Darij: vnde in Alexandro, libro
  sexto.' There is a similar sidenote at C. 16; see note to that line. This
  tomb of Darius is due to fiction. The description of it occurs (as said)
  in the sixth book of the Alexandreid, a vast poem in Latin, by one
  Philippe Gualtier de Chatillon, a native of Lille and a canon of Tournay,
  who flourished about <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 1200. According to
  this poet, the tomb was the work of a Jewish artist named Apelles. See
  Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer, ii. 353-5, and G. Douglas, ed. Small, i.
  134.</p>

  <p>503. There is a parallel passage in Le Rom. de la Rose, 14678-99.</p>

  <p>514. <i>daungerous</i>, sparing, not free; cf. l. 151.</p>

  <p>517. <i>Wayte</i>, observe, watch; 'observe what thing it is that we
  have a difficulty in obtaining.'</p>

  <p>521. 'With great demur (or caution) we set forth all we have to sell.'
  <i>With daunger</i> implies that the seller makes a great difficulty of
  selling things, i.&nbsp;e. drives a hard bargain, and makes a great favour of
  it. <i>Withoute daunger</i> means without opposition, or without
  resistance; Gower, C. A. v. ii. p. 40.</p>

  <p><i>Outen</i>, put out, set out or forth, is from A. S.
  <i>&#x16B;tian</i>, verb, a derivative of <i>&#x16B;t</i>, out. Both here
  and in G. 834, Tyrwhitt needlessly alters the reading to <i>uttren</i>,
  against all the MSS. The note in Bell's Chaucer says&mdash;'Difficulty in
  making our market makes us bring out all our ware for sale'; which is
  utterly remote from the true sense, and would be the conduct of a
  reckless, not of a cautious woman. Compare the next two lines.</p>

  <p>522. 'A great throng of buyers makes ware dear (because there is then
  great demand); and offering things too cheaply makes people think they
  are of little value (because there is then too ready a supply).' Hence
  the wise woman is careful not to be in too great a hurry to sell; and
  such is the meaning of l. 521. It is further implied that, when she gets
  her expected price, she does not hold out for a higher one.</p>

  <p>552. From Le Rom. de la Rose, 9068, which again is from Ovid.
  'Spectatum ueniunt, ueniunt spectentur ut ipsae'; Art. Amat. i. 99.</p>

  <p>553. 'How could I know where my favour was destined to be
  bestowed?'</p>

  <i>prechings</i>; but all the rest have <i>preching</i>, which I
  therefore retain. <i>To preching</i> means 'to any place where a sermon
  was being preached'; much as we say 'to church.' But the sermons were
  often given in the open air. The Wife's object was to go wherever there
  was a concourse of people, in order to shew her best clothes. Women still
  go 'to church' for a like <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  evil of pilgrimages; see his Works, ed. Matthew, p. 279; ed. Arnold, i.
  83.</p>

  <p>558. 'The miracle-plays were favourite occasions for people to
  assemble in great numbers.'&mdash;Wright. Wright refers to a tale among
  his Latin Stories, p. 100. See the Sermon against Miracle-Plays, in
  Reliquiae Antiquae, ii. 42; reprinted in Mätzner's Sprachproben, ii.
  224.</p>

  <p>559. 'And wore upon (me) my gay scarlet gowns.' The use of <i>upon</i>
  without a case following it is curious; but see D. 1018, 1382 below.</p>

  <p>The word <i>gyte</i> occurs again in A. 3954, where Simkin's wife
  wears 'a <i>gyte</i> of reed,' i.&nbsp;e. a red gown. Nares shews that it is
  used thrice by Gascoigne, and once by Fairfax. The sense of 'robe' will
  suit the passage there quoted. Skelton has <i>gyte</i> in Elynour, l. 68,
  where the sense of 'robe' or 'dress' is certain. It is clearly the same
  word as the Lowland Scotch <i>gyde</i>, a dress, robe; see note to A.
  3954 (p. 118). That the word meant both 'veil' and 'gown' appears from
  the fact that Roquefort explains the derived O.&nbsp;F. <i>wiart</i> as a veil
  with which women cover their faces; whilst Godefroy explains its variant
  form <i>guiart</i> as a dress or vestment.</p>

  <p>560. The sense is; 'the worms, moths, and mites never fretted them
  (i.&nbsp;e. my dresses) one whit; I say it at my peril.' There is no
  difficulty, and the reading is quite correct. Yet Tyrwhitt altered
  <i>peril</i> to <i>paraille</i>, which he explains by 'apparel,' and
  Wright actually explains <i>perel</i>, in the Harl. MS., in the same way!
  Such an explanation turns the whole into nonsense, as it could then only
  mean: 'the worms, &amp;c. never devoured <i>themselves</i> (!) at all
  upon my apparel.' Tyrwhitt evidently took it to mean 'never <i>fed</i>
  themselves upon (i.&nbsp;e. with) my apparel'; but it is impossible that
  <i>frete hem</i> could ever be so interpreted. <i>Frete</i> can only mean
  'devoured,' and it requires an accusative case; this accusative is
  <i>hem</i>, which can only refer to the <i>gytes</i> or 'gowns.' And this
  leaves no other sense for <i>peril</i> except precisely 'peril,' which is
  of course right. <i>Upon my peril</i> is clearly a phrase, with the same
  sense as 'at my peril.' The phrase is no recondite one; cf. Rich. III.
  iv. i. 26, where we find 'on my peril'; and again, 'upon his peril,' in
  Antony, v. 2. 143; Cymbeline, v. 4. 189.</p>

  <p>566. <i>of my purveyance</i>, owing to my prudence, or prudent
  foresight; cf. l. 570. <i>Purveyance</i>, <i>providence</i>, and
  <i>prudence</i> are mere variants; from Lat. <i>prouidentia</i>.</p>

  <p>575. 'I made him believe'; see above. <i>enchanted</i>, bewitched,
  viz. with philtres or love-potions; according to an old belief. See
  Othello, i. 2. 63-79. Cf. also Le Rom. de la Rose, 13895:&mdash;'Si croi

  <p>613. <i>ascendent</i>, the sign in the ascendant (or just rising in
  the east) at my birth. This sign was Taurus, which was also called 'the
  mansion of Venus.' When Mars was seen in this sign when ascending, it
  shewed the influence of Mars on Venus. Cf. the 'Compleint of Mars.'</p>

  <p>In the margin of E. is a Latin note, referring us to 'Mansor
  Amphorison' 19'; followed by a quotation. The reference is to a treatise
  called 'Almansoris Propositiones,' which begins with the
  words:&mdash;'Aphorismorum compendiolum, mi Rex, petiisti,' &amp;c. Hence
  'Amphorison' 19' is an error for 'Aphorismorum 19.' This treatise is
  printed in a small volume entitled 'Astrologia Aphoristica Ptolomaei,
  Hermetis, ... Almansoris, &amp;c.; Ulmae, 1641.' In this edition, the
  section quoted (at p. 66) is not 19, but 14; and runs
  thus:&mdash;'Cuicunque fuerint in ascendente infortunae, turpem notam in
  facie patietur.' With 'infortunae,' we must supply 'planetae'; and the
  object of this quotation is, clearly, to explain l. 619. Still more to
  the point is a remark in sect. 74 of a treatise printed in the same
  volume, entitled 'Cl. Ptolomaei Centum Dicta'; where we
  find&mdash;'Quicunque <i>Martem ascendentem</i> habet, omnino cicatricem
  in facie habebit.'</p>

  <p>Immediately after the above, in the margin of E., is a second
  quotation, with a reference in the words:&mdash;'Hec Hermes in libro
  fiducie; Amphoris<sup>o</sup>. 24<sup>o</sup>.' Here 'Amphoris<i>m</i>o'
  should be 'Aphorismo.' The quotation occurs in a third treatise, printed
  in the same volume as the other two already mentioned, with the title
  'Hermetis centum Aphorismorum liber.' In this printed edition, the
  section quoted is not the 24th, but the 25th; and runs thus:&mdash;'In
  natiuitatibus mulierum, cum fuerit ascendens aliqua de domibus Veneris,
  Marte existente in eis [vel e contrario]<a name="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>, erit mulier impudica. Idem erit, si
  Capricornum habuerit <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page307"></a>[307]</span>in ascendente.' Here 'aliqua ... Veneris'
  means 'one of the mansions of Venus; her two mansions being Taurus and
  Libra.' The former is expressly referred to in l. 613, and is therefore
  intended.</p>

  <p>In sect. 28 of the same treatise, we find:&mdash;'Cum fuerit
  interrogatio pro muliere, simpliciter accipe significationem à Venere.'
  Hence Venus is the planet that ruled over women.</p>

  <p>'The woman that is born in this time [i.&nbsp;e. under Taurus] shall be
  effectuall ... she shall have many husbands and many children; she shall
  be in her best estate at xvi years, and she shall have a sign in the
  middest of her body.'&mdash;Shepherdes Kalender, ed. 1656, sig. Q 5.</p>

  <p>618. The phrase 'la chambre Venus' occurs in Le Rom. de la Rose,
  13540.</p>

  <p>621. <i>wis</i>, surely, certainly: 'for, may God so surely be my,'
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>624. 'Ne vous chaut s'il est <i>cors</i> ou <i>lons</i>'; Rom. de la
  Rose, 8554.</p>

  <p>634. <i>on the list</i>, on the ear. Such is the sense of <i>lust</i>
  in the Ancren Riwle, p. 212, l. 7, where the editor mistakes it. In Sir
  Ferumbras, l. 1900, mention is made of a man striking another 'on the
  luste' with his hand. The original sense of A.&nbsp;S. <i>hlyst</i> is the
  sense of 'hearing'; but the Icel. <i>hlust</i> commonly means 'ear.' Cf.
  E. <i>listen</i>. For <i>on the list</i>, Hl. Cm. and Tyrwhitt have
  <i>with his fist</i>; but Tyrwhitt, in his note on the line, inclines to
  the reading here given, and quotes from Sir T. More's poem entitled 'A
  Merry Jest of a Serjeant,' the lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  of this phrase in A. 1089; and the note at p. 65.</p>

  <p>642. <i>Romayn gestes</i>, the 'Roman gests,' in the collection called
  Gesta Romanorum, or stories of a like character. The reference, however,
  in this case is to Valerius Maximus, lib. vi. c. 3, as is certified by
  the note in the margin of E., viz. 'Valerius, lib. vi. fol. 19.' The
  passage is: 'Horridum C. quoque Sulpicii Galli maritale supercilium. Nam
  uxorem dimisit, quod eam <i>capite aperto</i> foris versatam
  cognouerat.'</p>

  <p>647. This story is from the same chapter in Valerius. The passage is:
  'Jungendus est his P. Sempronius Sophus, qui coniugem repudii nota
  affecit, nihil aliud quam se ignorante <i>ludos</i> ausam spectare.'</p>

  <p>648. <i>someres game</i>, summer-game; called <i>somer-game</i> in P.
  Plowman, B. v. 413; and, in later English, a <i>summering</i>; a rural
  sport at Midsummer. The great day was on Midsummer eve, and the games
  consisted of athletic sports, followed usually by bonfires. See Brand's
  Pop. Antiquities; Strutt, Sports and Pastimes, bk. iv. c. 3. § 22; the
  description of the Cotswold Games in Chambers, Book of Days, i. 714; the
  word <i>Summering</i> in Nares' Glossary, &amp;c. They were not always
  respectably conducted. <!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>651. See Ecclus. xxv. 25:&mdash;'Give the water no passage; neither a
  wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.' The Latin version is here quoted in
  the margin of E.</p>

  <p>655. This is clearly a quotation of some old saying, as shewn by the
  metre, which here varies, and becomes irregular. There is a slightly
  different version of it in Reliquiae Antiquae, i. 233:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Who that byldeth his howse all of salos,</p>
      <p>And prikketh a blynde horsse over the falowes,</p>
      <p>And suffereth his wif to seke many halos,</p>
      <p>God sende hym the blisse of everlasting galos!'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The proverb implies that these three things are the signs of a foolish
  man. <i>Salwes</i> are osiers; the osier is commonly called <i>sally</i>
  in Shropshire, and the same name is given to all kinds of willows. It is
  not from the Lat. <i>salix</i> directly, but from the native A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>sealh</i>, which is merely cognate with <i>salix</i>, not borrowed
  from it. The three foolish things to do are; to build a house all of
  osiers, to spur a blind horse over a fallow-field, and to allow a wife to
  go on a pilgrimage. To go on a pilgrimage is here called 'to seek
  hallows,' i.&nbsp;e. saints, or saints' shrines; and the expression was a
  common one; cf. A. 14. 'Gone to seke hallows' occurs in Skelton, i. 426,
  l. 7, ed. Dyce; and the editor quotes two more examples at p. 337 of vol.

  <p>669. This book was evidently a MS. containing several choice extracts
  from various authors; see l. 681.</p>

  <p>671. <i>Valerie.</i> This refers to a treatise which Mr. Wright
  attributes to Walter Mapes, entitled Epistola Valerii ad Rufinum, and
  common in manuscripts; the subject is, <i>De non ducenda uxore</i>. See
  Warton, Hist. E. Poetry, 1840, ii. 188, <i>note</i>. 'As to the rest of
  the contents of this volume, Hieronymus contra Jovinianum, and Tertullian
  de Pallio are sufficiently known; and so are the letters of Eloisa and
  Abelard, the Parables of Solomon, and Ovid's Art of Love. I know of no
  Trotula but one, whose book Curandarum aegritudinum muliebrium, ante, in,
  et post partum, is printed int. Medicos antiquos, Ven. 1547. What is
  meant by Crisippus, I cannot guess.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt.</p>

  <p><i>Theofraste</i>, Theophrastus, i.&nbsp;e. the treatise mentioned above;
  see note to l. 221. It is frequently quoted above; see notes to ll. 221,
  235, 257, 271, 282, 285, 293, 303. He is called <i>Theofrates</i> in Le
  Roman, l. 8599. <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>[309]</span></p>

  <p>676. <i>Tertulan</i>, Tertullian. I do not quite understand why
  Tyrwhitt (see note to l. 671) singled out his treatise De Pallio, which
  is a treatise recommending the wearing of the Greek <i>pallium</i> in
  preference to the Roman <i>toga</i>. Quite as much to the present purpose
  are his treatises De Exhortatione Castitatis, dissuading a friend from
  marrying a second time; and De Monogamia and De Pudicitia, much to the
  same purport.</p>

  <p>677. <i>Crisippus</i>, Chrysippus. There were at least two of this
  name: (1) the Stoic philosopher, born <span class="sm">B.C.</span> 280,
  died 207, praised by Cicero (Academics) and Horace. Also (2) the
  physician of Cnidos, in the time of Alexander the Great, frequently
  mentioned by Pliny. It is highly probable that neither the Wife of Bath
  nor Chaucer knew much about him. The poet certainly caught the name from
  Jerome's treatise against Jovinian, near the end of bk. i.; Epist. i. 52.
  We there find:&mdash;'Ridicule <i>Chrysippus</i> ducendam uxorem sapienti
  praecipit, ne Iouem Gamelium et Genethlium uiolet.'</p>

  <p><i>Helowys</i>, Heloise, niece of Fulbert, a canon in the cathedral of
  Paris, was secretly married to the celebrated Abelard, a proficient in
  scholastic learning. She afterwards became a nun in the convent of
  Argenteuil, of which she was, in course of time, elected the prioress.
  Thence she removed, with her nuns, to the oratory of the Paraclete, near
  Troyes, where the last twenty years of her life were spent. She died in
  1164, and was buried in Abelard's tomb. I have no doubt at all that
  Chaucer derived his knowledge of her from the short sketch of her life
  given in Le Roman de la Rose, ll. 8799-8870, where the title of 'abbess'
  (F. <i>abéesse</i>) is conferred upon her. Only a few lines above, we
  find the name of <i>Valerius</i>, who (it is there said, at l. 8727)
  declared that a modest woman was rarer than a ph&oelig;nix; and again, at
  l. 8759, we find: 'Si cum Valerius raconte'; and, at l. 8767:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Valerius qui se doloit</p>
      <p>De ce que Rufin se voloit</p>
      <p>Marier,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This identifies Valerius as being the very one, whose name Walter
  Mapes assumed; as is explained above (note to l. 671).</p>

  <p>As to <i>Trotula</i>, I may here observe, in addition to what is said
  in the note to l. 671, that Warton mentions a MS. in Merton College, with
  the title 'Trottula Mulier Salerniterna de passionibus mulierum'; another
  copy (which I have seen) is in the Camb. Univ. Library. He
  adds&mdash;'there is also extant, "Trottula, seu potius Erotis medici
  muliebrium liber"; Basil. 1586; 4to.' See Warton, Hist. E. Poet. 1840,
  ii. 188, <i>note</i>.</p>

  <p>692. <i>peintede</i>, depicted; alluding to the fable in Æsop, where a
  sculptor represented a man conquering a lion. The lion's criticism was to
  the effect that he had heard of cases in which the lion conquered the
  man. So likewise, the Wife's view of clerks differed widely from the
  clerk's view of wives. In the margin of E. is the note&mdash;'Quis pinxit
  leonem?' The fable is amongst the 'Fables of Æsop' as <!-- Page 310
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>[310]</span>printed by
  Caxton, lib. iv. fab. 15; see Jacobs' edition, i. 251. In his note upon
  the sources of this fable, Mr. Jacobs refers us to&mdash;'Romulus, iv.
  15. Man and Lion (statue). I. Lôqman, 7; Sophos, 58. II. Plutarch,
  Apophth., Laced. 69; Scol. Eurip., Kor., 103; Aphth. 38; Phaedrus, App.
  Burm., p. 20; Gabr., i. (not in Babrius); Avian, 24. III. Ademar, 52;
  Marie, 69; Berach., 56; Wright, ii. 28. IV. Kirch., i. 80; Lafontaine,
  iii. 10; Rob., Oest. V. Spectator, no. 11; L. 100, J. 84; Croxall, 30
  (Lion and Statue).'</p>

  <p>It is well put by Steele, in The Spectator, no. 11: 'Your quotations
  put me in mind of the Fable of the Lion and the Man. The Man, walking
  with that noble Animal, shewed him, in the Ostentation of Human
  Superiority, a Sign of a Man killing a Lion. Upon which the Lion said
  very justly, We Lions are none of us Painters, else we could shew you a
  hundred Men killed by Lions, for one Lion killed by a Man.' Observe that
  here, as in Chaucer, the reference is to a painting, not to
  sculpture.</p>

  <p>696. <i>all the mark of Adam</i>, all beings made like Adam, i.&nbsp;e. all
  males. This idiomatic expression is cleared up by reference to F. 880,
  where <i>merk</i> means 'image' or 'likeness'; see that passage.</p>

  <p>697. The <i>children of Mercurie</i> are the <i>clerks</i>, and those
  of <i>Venus</i> are the <i>women</i>; see ll. 693, 694. See below.</p>

  <p>699, 700. Here the reference is to astrology. The whole matter is
  explained in a side-note in E., which is copied from § 2 of Almansoris
  Astrologi Propositiones (see note to l. 613 above), and requires some
  correction. It should run as follows:&mdash;'Vniuscuiusque planetarum
  septem exaltacio in illo loco esse dicitur, in quo substantialiter
  patitur ab alio contrarium, veluti Sol in Ariete, qui Saturni casus est.
  Sol enim habet claritatem, Saturnus tenebrositatem.... Et sic Mercurius
  in Virgine, qui casus est Veneris. Alter [scilicet Mercurius] namque
  significat scientiam et philosophiam. Altera vero causat alacritates et
  quicquid est saporiferum corpori.' I take this to mean, that the sign
  which is called the 'exaltation' of one planet (in which it exhibits its
  greatest influence) is also the 'dejection' of another which is there
  weakest. Thus the sign Virgo was the 'exaltation' of Mercury; but it was
  also the 'dejection' of Venus, whose 'exaltation' was in Pisces. For the
  dejection of every planet occurs in the sign opposite to that in which is
  its exaltation; and Virgo and Pisces are opposite. The word <i>casus</i>
  is here used in the astrological sense of 'dejection.' It further follows
  that Pisces was the 'depression' of Mercury, which Chaucer expresses by
  the term <i>desolat</i>. The note also tells us that the planet Mercury
  implies 'science and philosophy'; whilst Venus implies 'lively joys and
  whatever is agreeable to the body.'</p>

  <p>Venus is again alluded to as being in her exaltation in Pisces, in F.
  273. Gower refers to Virgo as being the exaltation of Mercury; Conf.
  Amant. iii. 121.</p>

  <p>715. <i>Eva</i>, Eve. The spelling <i>Eva</i> is frequently contrasted
  with that of <i>Ave</i>, the salutation of Gabriel to Mary. Tyrwhitt
  says:&mdash;'Most <!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page311"></a>[311]</span>of the following instances are mentioned
  in the Epistola Valerii ad Rufinum de non ducenda uxore. See also Rom. de
  la Rose, 9140, 9615, et suiv.' In Méon's edition of Le Rom. de la Rose,
  Deianira is mentioned in l. 9235, and Samson in l. 9243; I do not quite
  make out Tyrwhitt's numbering of the lines.</p>

  <p>721. Cf. the Monkes Tale, B. 3205, 3256.</p>

  <p>725. Cf. the Monkes Tale, B. 3285, 3310.</p>

  <p>727. From Jerome against Jovin., lib. i. (near the end); Epist. i. 52.
  'Socrates Xantippen et Myron neptem Aristidis duas habebat uxores ...
  Quodam autem tempore cum infinita conuicia ex superiori loco ingerenti
  Xantippae restitisset, aqua perfusus immunda, nihil amplius respondit,
  quàm, capite deterso: Sciebam (inquit) futurum, ut ista tonitrua hymber
  sequeretur.' The story is thus told by Erasmus, as translated by Udall.
  'Socrates, after that he had within dores forborne his wife Xantippe, a
  greate while scoldyng, and at the last beyng wearie, had set him doune
  without the strete doore, she beyng moche the more incensed, by reason of
  her housbandes quietnesse and stilnesse, powred down a pisse-bolle upon
  him out of a windore, and al beraied him. But upon soche persones as
  passed by, laughing and hauing a good sport at it, Socrates also, for his
  part, laughed again as fast as the best, saiyng: Naie, I thought verie
  well in my minde, and did easily prophecie, that after so great a thonder
  would come a raine.'&mdash;Udall, tr. of Erasmus' Apophthegmes,
  <i>Socrates</i>, § 59.</p>

  <p>733. These instances are also from Jerome, some twenty lines further
  on (same page). 'Quid referam Pasiphaën, Clytemnestram, et Eriphylam;
  quarum prima deliciis diffluens, quippe regis uxor, tauri dicitur
  expetisse concubitus: altera occidisse uirum ob amorem adulteri: tertia
  prodidisse Amphiarãum, et saluti uiri monile aureum praetulisse.' This
  passage is quoted, almost in the same words, in the margin of E. As to
  Eriphyle, Chaucer shews that he possessed further information, as he
  mentions Thebes. He consulted, in fact, the Thebaid of Statius, bk. iv,
  where we learn that Eriphyle betrayed her husband Amphiaraus, for a
  golden necklace; he was thus forced to accompany Polynices to the siege
  of Thebes, where he perished by being swallowed up by an earthquake.
  Chaucer again calls him <i>Amphiorax</i> in Anelida, 57, and in Troilus,
  ii. 105, v. 1500. Cf. Lydgate's Siege of Thebes, part 3.</p>

  <p>747. Tyrwhitt says:&mdash;'In the Epistola Valerii, in MS. Reg. 12. D.
  iii. [in the British Museum], the story is told thus: "<i>Luna</i> virum
  suum interfecit quem nimis odivit: <i>Lucilia</i> suum quem nimis amavit.
  Illa sponte miscuit aconita: haec decepta furorem propinavit pro amoris
  poculo." <i>Lima</i> and <i>Luna</i> in many MSS. are only
  distinguishable by a small stroke over the <i>i</i>, which may easily be
  overlooked where it is, and supposed where it is not.' However, the right
  name is neither <i>Lima</i> nor <i>Luna</i>, but <i>Liuia</i> (Livia),
  which is easily confused with either of the other forms. Livia poisoned
  her husband Drusus (son of Tiberius), at the instigation of Sejanus,

  Lucia (or rather Lucilia) was the wife of Lucretius the poet; see
  Tennyson's poem of Lucretius (Lounsbury, Studies in Chaucer, ii.
  369).</p>

  <p>757. This is a stock story, told of various people. Tyrwhitt says that
  it occurs in the Epistola Valerii, of one <i>Pavorinus</i>, and that the
  story begins:&mdash;'Pavorinus flens ait Arrio.' Lounsbury (Studies in
  Chaucer, ii. 369) referring to the same story, gives the name as
  Pacuvius. It is, in fact, one of the stories in the Gesta Romanorum (tale
  33), where it is ascribed to Valerius. (By Valerius is, of course, meant
  the Epistola Valerii of Walter Mapes, where it duly appears, as Tyrwhitt
  notes, and may be found in MS. Reg. 12. D. iii; as is observed by Sir F.
  Madden, in a note to Warton's Hist. E. Poet., ed. Hazlitt, 1871, i. 250.
  It does <i>not</i> refer to Valerius Maximus, as I have ascertained.)</p>

  <p>In the Gesta, it is told of Paletinus, who lamented to his friend
  Arrius that a certain tree in his garden was fatal, for three of his
  wives had, successively, hung themselves upon it. Arrius at once begged
  to have some slips of it; and Paletinus 'found this remarkable tree the
  most productive part of his estate.'</p>

  <p>The story is really from Cicero, De Oratore, lib. ii. 69; 278. 'Salsa
  sunt etiam, quae habent suspicionem ridiculi absconditam; quo in genere
  est illud Siculi, cum familiaris quidam quereretur, quod diceret, uxorem
  suam suspendisse se de ficu. <i>Amabo te</i>, inquit, <i>da mihi ex ista
  arbore, quos seram, surculos</i>.'</p>

  <p>Thus the original story only mentions <i>one</i> wife. This is just
  how stories grow.</p>

  <p>A similar story is ascribed to Diogenes. 'When he [Diogenes] had on a
  time espied women hanging upon an olive-tree, and there strangled to
  death with the halters: Would God (said he) that the other trees had like
  fruite hanging on them!'&mdash;Udall, tr. of Erasmus' Apophthegmes,
  Diogenes, § 124.</p>

  <p>766. The horrible story of 'the Widow of Ephesus' is of this
  character, but not <i>quite</i> so bad, as her husband died naturally.
  See Wright's introduction to his edition of The Seven Sages, p. lxvi; and
  the text of the same, pp. 84-9. It occurs in John of Salisbury,
  Policraticus, viii. 11. And see Exempla of Jacques de Vitry, ed. Crane,
  1890, p. 228; Clouston's Pop. Tales, i. 29.</p>

  <p>769. Alluding, doubtless, to Jael and Sisera; see note to A. 2007.</p>

  <p>775. 'I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house
  with a wicked woman'; Ecclus. xxv. 16. Cf. Prov. xxi. 19.</p>

  <p>778. From Prov. xxi. 9; and ll. 780, 781 seem to have been suggested
  by the following verse (xxi. 10).</p>

  <p>782. This is from Jerome, near the end of bk. i. of his treatise
  against Jovinian (p. 52):&mdash;'Scribit Herodotus, quod mulier cum ueste
  deponat et uerecundiam.' This again is from Herodotus, bk. i. c. 8, where
  it is told as a saying of Gyges:&mdash;<span title="hama de kithôni ekduomenôi, sunekduetai kai tên aidô gunê" class="grk"

  <p>784. From Prov. xi. 22.</p>

  <p>799. <i>breyde</i>, started, woke up. The A. S. verb <i>bregdan</i> is
  properly a strong verb, with the pt. t. <i>brægd</i>; so that the true
  form of the pt. t. in M.&nbsp;E. is <i>breyd</i>, without a final <i>e</i>.
  But it was turned into a weak verb, with the pt. t. <i>breyd-e</i> (as
  here), by confusion with such verbs as <i>seyd-e</i>, <i>deyd-e</i>,
  <i>leyd-e</i>, and the like. It is remarkable that our author is
  inconsistent in the use of the form for the pt. t. In his earlier poems,
  he has the older form <i>abrayd</i>, riming with <i>sayd</i> (pp.), Book
  of the Duch. 192; or <i>abreyd</i>, riming with <i>seyd</i> (pp.), Ho. of
  Fame, 110. But in the Cant. Tales, we find only the weak form
  <i>breyd-e</i>, riming with <i>seyd-e</i>, <i>preyd-e</i>, and
  <i>deyd-e</i>, B. 3728; with <i>seyd-e</i>, <i>leyd-e</i>, B. 837; and
  with <i>seyd-e</i>, A. 4285, F. 1027. Also <i>abreyd-e</i>, riming with
  <i>seyd-e</i>, <i>deyd-e</i>, A. 4190, E. 1061.</p>

  <p>816. This is <i>one</i> of the ways in which our MSS. have
  perished.</p>

  <p>824. Cf. 'from Hulle to Cartage'; A. 404; and see C. 722.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Tale of the Wyf of Bathe.</b></p>

  <p>For a discussion of the source of this Tale, see vol. iii. p. 447.</p>

  <p>A very similar story occurs in Gower's Confessio Amantis, bk. i. (p.
  89, Pauli's edition), where the hero of the story is named Florent, and
  is said to have been a grandson of the Roman Emperor Claudius.</p>

  <p>It also occurs in the Book of Ballymote, an Irish MS. of the
  fourteenth century. The Irish text was printed, together with a
  translation by Dr. Whitley Stokes, in The Academy, Apr. 23, 1892, p. 399.
  Dr. Stokes claims for the Tale a Celtic origin. See also The Academy,
  Apr. 30, 1892.</p>

  <p>Chaucer's Tale has been modernised by Dryden. This later version
  contains many spirited lines, but lacks the grace of the original. It is
  interesting as a commentary, and is worth comparison.</p>

  <p>This Tale has been well edited, with notes, in Mätzner's Altenglische
  Sprachproben, i. 338.</p>

  <p>857. The author of the spurious Pilgrim's Tale, which, it is said,
  William Thynne wished to insert in his edition of Chaucer, has
  plagiarised from the opening lines of the Wife of Bath's Tale in the
  coolest manner. I quote some of his lines, for comparison, from Thynne's
  Animadversions, &amp;c., ed. Furnivall, Appendix I., p. 79, ll.

  <p>For a general discussion of the legends about King Arthur, see the
  essay in vol. i. (p. 401) of the Percy Folio MS., ed. Hales and
  Furnivall. In Malory's Morte Arthure we have an example of a fairy in
  Arthur's sister, Morgan le Fay, who was 'put to scole in a nonnery; and
  ther she lerned so moche that she was a grete clerke of nygromancye'; bk.
  i. cap. 2.</p>

  also B. 754, 1978, and the notes.</p>

  <p>On the subject of Fairies, see Keightley's Fairy Mythology, and
  similar works. Tyrwhitt notes that few old authors tell us so much about
  them as Gervase of Tilbury.</p>

  <p>866. <i>limitours</i>, limiters; see A. 209, and the note; D. 1711; P.
  Plowman, B. v. 138, C. xxiii. 346; Massingberd, Eng. Reformation, p.
  110.</p>

  <p>868. The number of mendicant friars in England, during the latter half
  of the fourteenth century, was indeed large. In Wyclif's Works, ed.
  Arnold, iii. 400, we read that 'now ben mony thousand of freris in
  Englond'; and, at p. 511, that they were, 'as who seith, withoute
  noumbre.' In P. Plowman, C. xxiii. 269, Conscience accuses the friars of
  waxing 'oute of numbre,' and reminds them that 'Hevene haveth evene
  numbre, and helle is withoute numbre.'</p>

  <p>869. The occurrence here of <i>three consecutive lines</i> (869-871)
  in which the first foot is deficient, consisting only of a single
  accented syllable, is worth notice. The way in which Tyrwhitt 'amends'
  these lines is most surprising. He inserts <i>and</i> five times, and his
  first line defies scansion, though I suppose he made <i>hall's</i> a
  monosyllable, and <i>kichen-es</i> trisyllabic, whereas it plainly has
  but two syllables. Here is his result.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Blissing halles, chambres, kichenes, <i>and</i> boures,</p>

      <p>This maketh that ther ben no faeries.'</p>
    </div>

  <p>Note that he actually seems to have read <i>dairies</i> and
  <i>faeries</i> as <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page315"></a>[315]</span>riming <i>dissyllabic</i> words! In which
  case the last of these four lines would have but <i>four</i> accents! But
  the rime merely concerns the two <i>final</i> syllables of those
  quadrisyllabic words. The riming of the two <i>former</i> syllables is
  unessential, and for the purpose of rime, accidental and otiose.</p>

  <p>MS. Pt. admits <i>and</i> before <i>boures</i>; and MS. Hl. admits
  <i>and</i> before <i>toures</i> and <i>dairies</i> (which does not alter
  the character of the lines). With these exceptions, all the seven MSS.
  omit all the five <i>and's</i> inserted by Tyrwhitt; and, in fact, they
  are all of them superfluous.</p>

  <p>For the benefit of those who are but little acquainted with this
  peculiarity of Middle English metre, I cite <i>four consecutive lines</i>
  of a similar character from Lydgate's Siege of Thebes, ll.

  '<i>Shippen</i>, a cow-house'; id. B. 15.</p>

  <p>875. <i>undermeles</i>, for <i>undern-meles</i>, undern-times. For the
  time of <i>undern</i>, see note to E. 260. <i>Meel</i> (pl. <i>meles</i>)
  is the A.&nbsp;S. <i>m&#x1E3;l</i>, a time. The time referred to, <i>in this
  particular instance</i>, seems to be the middle of the afternoon; or
  simply 'afternoons,' as opposed to 'mornings.' For this sense, cf.
  'Undermele, <i>Postmeridies</i>,' in the Prompt. Parv. Nares, s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>under-meal</i>, gives other instances; but he fails to realise the
  changeable sense of the word; and is quite wrong in saying (s. v.
  <i>undertime</i>) that the last-named word is unconnected with
  <i>undern</i>. He also wrongly dissociates <i>undern</i> from
  <i>arndern</i> and <i>orndern</i>.</p>

  <p>876. 'All religious persons were bound, if possible, to recite the
  divine office ... at the proper hour, in the choir; but secular priests,
  not living in common, and friars, being by their rule obliged to walk
  about within their limitation, to beg their maintenance, were allowed to
  say it privately,... as they walked.'&mdash;Bell. Cf. B. 1281.</p>

  <p>880. <i>incubus.</i> Milton (P. R. ii. 152) speaks of Belial as being,
  after Asmodai, 'the fleshliest incubus.' Mr. Jerram's note on the line
  says: 'Some of the ejected angels were believed not to have fallen into
  hell, but to have remained in the middle of the region of air (P. R. ii.
  117), where in various shapes they tempt men to sin. It was said that
  they hoped to counteract the effects of Christ's coming by engendering
  with some virgin a semi-demon, who should be a power of evil. In this way
  Merlin, and even Luther, were reported to have been <!-- Page 316
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>[316]</span>begotten.' See
  the Romance of Merlin, ed. Wheatley, ch. i. pp. 9, 10; and the poem of
  Merlin in the Percy Folio MS.</p>

  <p>881. Tyrwhitt and others adopt the reading <i>no dishonour</i>, as in
  the old black-letter editions; and MS. Cm. has the reading <i>non</i>. At
  first sight, this looks right, but a little reflection will incline us
  rather to adopt the reading of nearly all the MSS., as given in the
  present text. For to say that the friar was an incubus, and yet did women
  no dishonour, is contradictory. The meaning is, possibly, that the friar
  brought upon women dishonour, and nothing more; whereas the incubus never
  failed to cause conception. Lounsbury (Studies in Chaucer, i. 257) adopts
  the reading here given, but interprets it thus:&mdash;'The dishonour of a
  woman is, in the eyes of the Wife of Bath, to be reckoned not as a crime,
  but as a peccadillo.' (See the whole passage.) The subject will hardly
  bear further discussion; but it is impossible to ignore the repeated
  charges of immorality brought against the friars by Wyclif and others.
  Wyclif says&mdash;'thei slen wommen that withstonden hem in this synne';
  Works, ed. Matthew, p. 6.</p>

  <p>884. <i>fro river</i>, i.&nbsp;e. he was returning from hawking at the
  river-side. See B. 1927, and the note.</p>

  <p>887. <i>maugree hir heed</i>, lit. 'in spite of her head,' i.&nbsp;e. in
  spite of all she could do, without her consent. Cf. A. 1169, 2618; also
  I. 974, where we find:&mdash;'if the womman, <i>maugree hir heed</i>,
  hath been afforced.' Mätzner remarks that, in some cases, we find a part
  of the head referred to, instead of the whole head. Hence the
  expressions: <i>maugre his nose</i>, Rob. of Gloucester, 2090 (p. 94, ed.
  Hearne); <i>maugree thyne yen</i>, Ch. C.&nbsp;T., D. 315; <i>maugree hir eyen
  two</i>, id., A. 1796; <i>maugree my chekes</i>, Allit. Poems, ed.
  Morris, C. 54; <i>m. here chekis</i>, P. Plowman, B. iv. 50; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>909. <i>lere</i>, learn; as in B. 181, 630, C. 325, 578, &amp;c. But
  the right sense is 'teach.' See l. 921.</p>

  <p><i>twelf-month</i>, &amp;c. 'There seems to have been some mysterious
  importance attached to this particular time of grace,'
  &amp;c.&mdash;Bell. I think not. The solution is simply, that it takes an
  extra day to make the date agree. If we fix any date, as Nov. 21, 1890,
  the space of a year afterwards only brings us to Nov. 20, 1891; if we
  want to keep to the <i>same day</i> of the month, we must make the space
  include 'a year and a day.' This is what any one would naturally do; and
  that is all. Cf. A. 1850, and the note. '<i>Year and Day</i>, is a time
  that determines a right in many cases;... So is the <i>Year and Day</i>
  given in case of Appeal, in case of Descent after Entry or Claim,'
  &amp;c.; Cowell, Intrepreter of Words and Terms. See l. 916 below; and
  cf. <i>Eight days</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a week, in the New Eng. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>929-30. Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 9977-94. For <i>y-plesed</i>, Tyrwhitt
  and Wright read <i>y-preised</i>, contrary to the seven best MSS.; which
  gives an imperfect rime. <i>preysed</i> rimes with <i>reysed</i> (D.
  706).</p>

  <p>940. <i>galle</i>, sore place. '<i>Galle</i>, soore yn man or beeste';
  Prompt. Parv. 'Let the <i>galled</i> jade wince'; Hamlet, iii. 2.
  253.</p>

  <p><i>clawe</i> means 'to scratch'; and to <i>clawe upon the galle</i> is
  to scratch or rub a sore. This may be taken in two ways; hence the
  difficulty about the reading in l. 941, where E. Cm. have <i>kike</i>,
  i.&nbsp;e. kick, whilst Hn. Hl. have <i>like</i>, and Cp. Pt. Ln. have <i>loke
  or he seith us soth</i>. The last of these three variations gives no
  sense, and is certainly wrong; but either of the other readings will
  serve. I take them in order.</p>

  <p>(1) <i>kike</i>, kick. Here the sense is:&mdash;'if any one scratch us
  on a sore place (and so hurt us), we shall kick, because he tells us the
  truth (too plainly).' This goes well with the context, as it answers to
  the <i>repreve us of our vyce</i> in l. 937.</p>

  <p>(2) <i>like</i>, like (it), be pleased. Here the sense is:&mdash;'if
  any one stroke us on a sore place (and so soothe the itching), we shall
  be pleased, because he tells us the truth (or what we think to be the
  truth).' But I feel inclined to reject this reading, because it gives so
  forced a sense to the words&mdash;<i>for he seith us sooth</i>. There is,
  however, no difficulty about the use of <i>claw</i> in the sense of 'to
  rub lightly, so as to soothe irritation'; for which see examples in the
  New English Dictionary. It is particularly used in the phrase <i>to
  claw</i> one's <i>back</i>, i.&nbsp;e. to soothe, flatter; but the word
  <i>galle</i> suggests a place where friction would rather hurt than
  soothe.</p>

  <p>I leave it to the reader to settle this nice question.</p>

  <p>949. <i>rake-stele</i>, the handle of a rake. The word <i>stele</i> is
  still in use provincially. '<i>Stale</i>, any stick, or handle, such as
  the stick of a mop or a fork'; <i>South Warwickshire</i>; E. D. S. Gl. C.
  6. '<i>Stale</i> [stae·ul], <i>s.</i> handle; as, <i>mop-stale</i>,
  <i>pick-stale</i>, <i>broom-stale</i>'; Elworthy's West Somerset Words.
  And see <i>Steal</i> in Ray's Glossary; <i>Stele</i> in Nares;
  <i>Steale</i> in Halliwell; &amp;c. Cf. A. 3785; P. Plowman, C. xxii.
  279. Golding translates Ovid's <i>hastile</i> (Metam. vii. 676) by
  'Iaueling-<i>steale</i>.' The <i>e</i> is 'open'; cf. A.&nbsp;S. <i>stela</i>;
  hence the rime with <i>hele</i> (A. S. <i>helan</i>) is perfect.</p>

  <p>950. 'Car fame ne puet riens celer'; Rom. de la Rose, 19420. See also
  the same, 16549-70.</p>

  <p>952. <i>Ovyde</i>; see Metamorph. xi. 174-193. But Chaucer seems to
  have purposely altered the story, since Ovid attributes the betrayal of
  the secret to Midas' <i>barber</i>, not his <i>wife</i>; and again, Ovid
  says that the barber dug a hole, and whispered it into the pit. Chaucer's
  version is an improved one. Cf. Troil. iii. 1389.</p>

  <p>961. Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 16724-32.</p>

  <p>968. Dryden is plainer, and less polite:&mdash;'But she must burst or
  blab.' Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 16568-9.</p>

  <p>972. <i>bitore</i>, bittern; <i>bumbleth</i>, makes a bellowing noise,
  which is also expressed by <i>bumping</i> or <i>booming</i>. Note that
  MS. Cm. has <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>[318]</span><i>bumbith</i>. Owing to the loud booming
  note of the male bittern, it is called in A.&nbsp;S. <i>r&#x101;re-dumle</i>
  or <i>r&#x101;re-dumbla</i>, from <i>r&#x101;rian</i>, to roar; see
  Wright's Glossaries. In provincial English, it is called a
  <i>butter-bump</i>, or a <i>bumble</i>; or, from its frequenting moist
  places, a <i>bog-bumper</i>, a <i>bog-drum</i>, or a <i>bull o' the
  bog</i>; see Swainson's Provincial Names of British Birds, E. D. S., p.
  146. It was formerly thought that the cry was produced by the bird
  plunging its bill into mud and then blowing, as in the present passage;
  others thought that it put its bill into a reed, a view taken by Dryden,
  as he here has the line:&mdash;'And, as a bittern <i>bumps within a
  reed</i>.' Sir T. Browne, in his Vulgar Errors, bk. iii. c. 27,
  controverts these notions, and attributes the note to the conformation of
  the bird's organs of voice. 'The same contradiction of the common notion
  is given, from personal experience, by the Rev. S. Fovargue, in his New
  Catalogue of Vulgar Errors, pp. 19-21'; note to Sir T. Browne, ed. S.
  Wilkin. The same editor further refers us to papers by Dr. Latham and Mr.
  Yarrell in the Linnaean Transactions, vols. iv, xv, and xvi. See Prof.
  Newton's Dict. of Birds.</p>

  reeds grew out of the pit, which, when breathed upon by the South wind,
  uttered the words which had been buried.</p>

  office, right as fyr in every contree ne stinteth nat to eschaufen and to

  adolescentia in pecore pascendo fuit occupata: validior aetas imperium
  Romanum rexit, et duplicavit: senectus excellentissimis ornamentis

  Maximus, lib. iii. c. 4 (De Humili Loco Natis). Cf. Livy, i. 22;
  Dionysius Halicarnasseus, iii; Ælian, xiv. 36.</p>

  <p>1168. <i>Senek</i>, Seneca. <i>Boece</i>, Boethius; see note to
  1109.</p>

  <p>1184. Ll. 1183-1190 are imitated from the following; 'Honesta, inquit
  [Epicurus], res est laeta paupertas. Illa uero non est paupertas, si
  laeta est. Cui enim cum paupertate bene conuenit, diues est. Non qui
  parum habet, sed qui plus cupit, pauper est.'&mdash;Seneca, Epist. ii. §
  4. This passage is quoted by John of Salisbury, Policraticus, l. vii. c.
  13.</p>

  <p><i>Othere clerkes</i> also includes Epicurus, whose sentiments Seneca
  here expresses; see Diogenes Laertius, x. 11. MS. E. here quotes the
  words 'honesta res est laeta paupertas' in the margin, and refers to
  'Seneca, in epistola.' It also has:&mdash;'Pauper est qui eget, eo quod
  non habet; sed qui non habet, nec appetit habere, ille diues est; de quo
  intelligitur id Apocalypsis tertio [Rev. iii. 17]&mdash;dicis quia diues
  sum.' With l. 1187 cf. Rom. de la Rose, 18766:&mdash;'Et convoitise fait
  povrece.'</p>

  <p>1191. All the editions adopt the reading <i>is sinne</i>, as in all
  the MSS. except E. and Cm. (the two best); see footnote, p. 354. But
  surely this is nonsense, and exactly contradicts l. 1183.</p>

  <p>1192. In the margin of MS. E. are quoted two lines from Juvenal, <!--
  Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page321"></a>[321]</span>Sat.
  x. 21,22:&mdash;'Cantabit uacuus coram latrone uiator; Et nocte ad lumen
  trepidabit arundinis umbram.' The latter of these lines should come
  first, and the usual readings are <i>motae</i> (not <i>nocte</i>),
  <i>lunam</i>, and <i>trepidabis</i>. However, it is only the other (and
  favourite) line that is here alluded to. The same line is quoted in Piers
  Plowman, B. xiv. 305; and is alluded to in Chaucer's tr. of Boethius, bk.
  ii. pr. 5. 129-130. In Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, ii. 364, is the
  remark:&mdash;'For <i>it is said comounli</i>, that a wey-goer, whan he
  is voide, singith sure bi the theef.'</p>

  <p>1195. In the margin of E. is written:&mdash;'Secundus philosophus:
  Paupertas est odibile bonum, sanitatis mater, curarum remocio, sapientie
  reparatrix, possessio sine calumpnia.' This is the very passage quoted,
  even more fully, in Piers Plowman, B. xiv. 275 (C. xvii. 117). Tyrwhitt's
  note is&mdash;'In this commendation of Poverty, our author seems plainly
  to have had in view the following passage of a fabulous conference
  between the emperor Adrian and Secundus the philosopher, reported by
  Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum Historiale, lib. x. cap. 71. "Quid est
  paupertas? Odibile bonum, sanitatis mater, remotio curarum, sapientie
  repertrix, negotium sine damno, possessio absque calumnia, sine
  sollicitudine felicitas." What Vincent has there published seems to have
  been extracted from a larger collection of <i>Gnomae</i> under the name
  of Secundus, which are still extant in Greek and Latin. See Fabricius,
  Bib. Gr., l. vi. c. x, and MS. Harl. 399.' Thus l. 1195 is a translation
  of <i>Paupertas est odibile bonum</i>, so that the proposal by Dr. Morris
  (Aldine edition of Chaucer, vol. i. p. vi) to adopt the reading
  <i>hatel</i> from MSS. Cp. Pt. Ln. instead of <i>hateful</i>, is founded
  on a mistake. The expression is contradictory, but it is so
  intentionally. 'Poverty is a gift which its possessors hate' is, of
  course, the meaning. Dryden well explains it:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Want is a bitter and a hateful good,</p>
      <p>Because its virtues are not understood.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>1196. This translates 'remotio curarum.'</p>

  <p>1197. This translates 'sapientie reparatrix,' not 'repertrix.'</p>

  <p>1199. <i>elenge</i>, miserable, hard to bear. <i>Elenge</i> is also
  spelt <i>alenge</i>, <i>alinge</i>, <i>alange</i>; see <i>Alange</i> in
  the New English Dictionary, though the proper form is rather
  <i>alenge</i>. It is a derivative of the intensive A. S. prefix
  <i>&#x1E3;</i> and <i>lenge</i>, a secondary form of <i>lang</i>, long;
  so that A.&nbsp;S. <i>&#x1E3;lenge</i> meant protracted, tedious, wearisome,
  as in Alfred's tr. of Boethius, xxxix. 4. But it was confused with the
  M.&nbsp;E. <i>elend</i>, strange, foreign, and so acquired the sense of
  'strange' as well as 'trying' or 'miserable.' See <i>Elynge</i> in the
  Gl. to P. Plowman, and the note to P. Pl. C. i. 204; also Mätzner's note
  to the Land of Cokayne, l. 15.</p>

  <p>1200. This line translates 'possessio absque calumnia.' The E.
  <i>challenge</i> is, in fact, derived from <i>calumnia</i>, through Old
  French.</p>

  <p>1202. Understand <i>him</i>: 'maketh (him) know his God and himself';
  see Dryden's paraphrase. Against this line, in the margin of MS. E., <!--
  Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>[322]</span>is
  written:&mdash;'Unde et Crates ille Thebanus, proiecto in mari non paruo
  auri pondere, Abite (inquit) pessime male cupiditates! Ego uos mergam, ne
  ipse mergar a uobis.' Probably Chaucer once intended to introduce this
  story into the text. It relates, apparently, to Crates of Thebes, the
  Cynic philosopher, who flourished about <span class="sm">B. C.</span>
  320.</p>

  <p>1203. <i>spectacle</i>, i.&nbsp;e. an optic glass, a kind of telescope. In
  the modern sense, the word was used in the plural, as at present. From
  Lydgate's London Lickpenny, st. 7, we learn that 'spectacles to reede'
  was, in his time, one of the cries of London. Cf. <i>prospectyves</i>,
  i.&nbsp;e. perspective glasses, in F. 234. Chaucer is here thinking of a
  passage in Le Roman de la Rose, where the E. version (l. 5551)
  has:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  </div>

  <p>This, again, is from Boethius, bk. ii. pr. 8. 22-33. Compare Chaucer's
  poem on Fortune, ll. 9, 32, 34, and my notes upon these lines; vol. i.
  pp. 383, 544.</p>

  <p>1208. See note to l. 1276 below; and cf. D. 1.</p>

  <p>1210. Compare C. 743, and the note.</p>

  <p>1215. For <i>also</i>, Tyrwhitt reads <i>also so</i>, against all
  authority, as he admits. The text is right as it stands. <i>Eld-e</i> is
  dissyllabic, the final <i>e</i> being preserved by the cæsura; and
  <i>also</i> means no more than 'so.' I suspect this is quoted from some
  French proverb. Dryden alters 'filth' to 'ugliness.'</p>

  <p>1224. <i>repair</i>, great resort, viz. of visitors.</p>

  <p>1234. 'I care not which of the two it shall be.' Cf. Gower, Conf.
  Amantis, i. 103:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1260. <i>toverbyde</i>, to over-bide, to outlive. Tyrwhitt substitutes
  <i>to overlive</i>, from the black-letter editions. <i>Gra-ce</i> is
  dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>1261. <i>shorte</i>, shorten; see D. 365.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Friar's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>1276. <i>auctoritees</i>; a direct reference to l. 1208 above. This
  goes far to show that the Friar's Tale was written immediately after the
  Wife's Tale. The Friar says, quite truly, that the Wife's Tale contains
  passages not unlike 'school-matter,' or disquisitions in the schools.
  Such a passage is that in ll. 1109-1212. Tyrwhitt shews that
  <i>auctoritas</i> was the usual word applied to a text of scripture; Bell
  adds, that it was applied, as now, to <i>any</i> authority for a
  statement. We might very well translate <i>auctoritees</i> by
  'quotations.' <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page323"></a>[323]</span></p>

  <p>1284. <i>mandements</i>, 'citations, or summonses, addressed to those
  accused of breaches of the canons, to appear and answer in the
  archdeacon's court'; Bell. Hence the name <i>somnour</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a server
  of summonses.</p>

  <p>1285. <i>tounes ende</i> (whence the name <i>Townsend</i>); we should
  now say, 'at the entry to every town'; cf. l. 1537. The Somnour was often
  opposed with violence, and was a very unpopular character.</p>

  <p>1294. The limiters had to cultivate the art of flattery, because they
  lived by begging from house to house.</p>

  <p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> After this line all the MSS.
  (except Hl.) wrongly insert lines 1307, 1308 (on p. 359). Perhaps the
  poet himself introduced these lines here at first, and afterwards
  perceived how much better they came in after l. 1306. It is not an
  important matter.</p>

  <p>1296. MS. Hl. has:&mdash;'Our host answerd and sayd the sompnour
  this'; which cannot be right.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Freres Tale.</b></p>

  <p>With respect to the source of this Tale, see vol. iii. p. 450.</p>

  <p>1300. <i>erchedeken.</i> As to the duties of the archdeacon, here
  described, compare A. 655, 658. He enforced discipline by threats of
  excommunication, and inflicted fines for various offences. Compare
  Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 166.</p>

  <p>1305. I.&nbsp;e. he punished church-reeves if they did ill, and all cases
  in which wills or contracts had been wantonly violated. 'Lakke of
  sacraments' refers, chiefly, to the neglect of the precept to communicate
  at Easter; also to neglect of baptism, and, possibly, of matrimony, as
  that was also a 'sacrament' in the church of our fathers.</p>

  <p>1307-8. These two lines occur here in MS. Hl. only; see note to 1294
  above.</p>

  <p>1309. Usury was prohibited by the Canon Law; cf. P. Plowman, C. vii.
  239.</p>

  <p>1314. 'No fine could save the accused from punishment.'</p>

  <p>1315. 'The neglect to pay tithes and Easter offerings came under the
  archdeacon's jurisdiction, as the bishop's diocesan officer. The friar
  does not scruple to make an invidious use of this subject at the expense
  of the parochial clergy, because, being obliged by his rule to gain his
  livelihood by begging, he had no interest in tithes.'&mdash;Bell.</p>

  <p>1317. Alluding to the shape of the bishop's crosier. In P. Plowman, C.
  xi. 92, the crosier is described as having a hook at one end, by which he
  draws men back to a good life, and a spike at the other, which he uses
  against hardened offenders. On the crosier, see Rock, Church of Our
  Fathers, ii. 181. The bishop dealt with such offenders as were
  contumacious to the archdeacon.</p>

  <p>1321. For the character of a Somnour, see A. 623.</p>

  <p>1323. <i>espiaille</i>, set of spies; see note to B. 2509, p. 213.

  elided.</p>

  <p>1327. <i>wood were</i>, should be, were to be as mad as a hare. See
  'As mad as a March hare' in Hazlitt's Proverbs.</p>

  <p>1329. The mendicant orders were subject only to their own general or
  superior, not to the bishops. In the piece called Jack Upland (§ 11),
  Jack asks the friars&mdash;'Why be ye not vnder your bishops visitations,
  and leegemen to our king?'&mdash;British Poets, ed. Chalmers, 1810; i.
  567.</p>

  <p>1331. <i>terme</i>, i.&nbsp;e. during the term.</p>

  <p>1332. <i>Peter</i>, by saint Peter. 'The summoner's repartee is

  ecclesiastical interference, and licensed.'&mdash;Bell. '<i>Stewes</i>,
  are those places which were permitted in England to women of professed
  incontinency.... But king Henry VIII., about the year 1546, prohibited

  contained such houses; see my notes to P. Plowman, C. vii. 366, 367.</p>

  <p>1343. <i>approwours</i>, agents, men who looked after his profits.
  From the O. Fr. <i>approuer</i>, <i>apprower</i>, to cause to profit, to
  enrich; from the O. Fr. sb. <i>prou</i>, profit, whence also E.
  <i>prowess</i>. Miswritten as <i>approver</i> in the seventeenth century,
  though distinct from <i>approve</i> (from <i>approbare</i>). See the New
  Eng. Dictionary. Tyrwhitt has the spelling <i>approvers</i>.</p>

  <p>1347. <i>Cristes curs</i>, i.&nbsp;e. excommunication.</p>

  <p>1349. <i>atte nale</i>, put for <i>atten ale</i>, lit. at the ale,
  where <i>ale</i> is put for 'ale-house.' <i>Atten</i> is for A.&nbsp;S. <i>æt
  tham</i>, where <i>tham</i> is the dat. neut. of the def. article. The
  expression is common; as in 'fouhten <i>atten ale</i>,' fought at the
  ale-house, P. Plowman, C. i. 43; 'with ydel tales <i>atte nale</i>,' id.
  C. viii. 19. 'Thou hast not so much charity in thee as to goe to the Ale
  with a Christian'; Two Gent. of Verona, ii. v. 61. So also <i>atte
  noke</i>, for <i>atten oke</i>, at the oak; see note to P. Pl. C. vii.
  207.</p>

  <p>1350. See John, xii. 6; and cf. the Legend of Judas Iscariot, printed
  (from MS. Harl. 2277) in Early Eng. Poems, ed. Furnivall, 1862; p.
  107.</p>

  <p>1352. <i>duetee</i> (Cp. <i>dewete</i>) is trisyllabic; see l. 1391.
  It is a coined word, having no Latin equivalent. The spelling
  <i>duete</i> occurs, in Anglo-French, in the Liber Albus, p. 211, l.
  23.</p>

  <p>1356. <i>Sir Robert</i>; the title of <i>Sir</i> was usually given to
  one of the secular clergy; cf. note to B. 4000, p. 248.</p>

  <p>1364. <i>hir</i>, her; so in E. Hn., but other MSS. have <i>thee</i>.
  The reading given is the better. The Somnour fined the man, but let the
  woman go; and then said that he let her go out of friendship for the man.
  This is intelligible; but the reading <i>thee</i> gives no sense to the
  words <i>for thy sake</i>.</p>

  <p>1365. 'You need not take any more trouble in this matter.'</p>

  <p>1367. <i>bryberý-es</i> (four syllables), i.&nbsp;e. modes of robbery. So
  in MSS. Hn. Cm. Cp. MSS. Hl. Pt. Ln. have <i>bribours</i>, which will not
  scan, unless (as in Hl.) we also read <i>Certeinly</i>, giving a line
  defective in the first foot. Tyrwhitt inserts <i>many</i> before
  <i>mo</i>, to fill up the line. <!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page325"></a>[325]</span></p>

  <p>1369. <i>dogge for the bowe</i>, a dog used to accompany an archer, to
  follow up a stricken deer; see the next line. The docility of such a dog
  is alluded to in E. 2014.</p>

  <p>1373. 'And, because such acquaintance brought him in the chief part of
  all his income.'</p>

  <p>1377. <i>ribybe.</i> In l. 1573, she is called 'an old
  <i>rebekke</i>.' So in Skelton's Elinour Rummyng, l. 492:&mdash;'There
  came an old <i>rybybe</i>.' And Ben Jonson speaks of 'some good
  <i>ribibe</i> ... you would hang now for a witch'; The Devil is an Ass,
  i. 1. 16. But probably Skelton and Ben Jonson merely took the word from
  Chaucer. A <i>ribybe</i> was, properly, a two-stringed Moorish fiddle;
  see note to A. 3331. Gifford's note on the passage in Ben Jonson,
  says:&mdash;'<i>Ribibe</i>, together with its synonym <i>rebeck</i>, is
  merely a cant term for an old woman. A ribibe, the reader knows, is a
  rude kind of a fiddle, and the allusion is, probably, to the inharmonious
  nature of its sounds.' Halliwell suggests some (improbable) confusion
  between <i>vetula</i> and <i>vitula</i>.</p>

  <p>I suspect that this old joke, for such it clearly is, arose in a very
  different way, viz. from a pun upon <i>rebekke</i>, a fiddle, and
  <i>Rebekke</i>, a married woman, from the mention of <i>Rebecca</i> in
  the marriage-service. For Chaucer himself notices the latter in E. 1704,
  which see. Observe that the form <i>rebekke</i>, as applied to the
  fiddle, is a corrupt one, though it is found in other languages. See
  <i>rebebe</i> in Godefroy's O.&nbsp;F. Dictionary, and <i>rebec</i> in
  Littré.</p>

  <p>1378. <i>Cause</i> and <i>wolde</i> are dissyllabic; and <i>brybe</i>,
  to rob, is a verb. But the editors ignore such elementary facts. The old
  editions insert <i>haue a</i> before <i>brybe</i>; and the modern
  editions insert <i>han a</i>; which, as Wright observes, is not to be
  found in the MSS!</p>

  <p>1381. See A. 103, 104, 108; and, for <i>courtepy</i>, A. 290.</p>

  <p>1382. <i>hadde upon</i>, had on; cf. D. 559, 1018.</p>

  <p>1384. 'Well overtaken, well met.' So in Partonope of Blois, 6390:
  'Syr, <i>wele atake</i>!' Cf. G. 556.</p>

  <p>1394. <i>for the name</i>, because of the disgrace attaching to the
  very name. The Friar is severe.</p>

  <p>1405. <i>sworn-e</i>, a plural form; the word <i>sworn</i> being here
  used adjectivally. See note to A. 1132, p. 66.</p>

  <p>1408. <i>venim</i>, spite. <i>wariangles</i>, shrikes. According to C.
  Swainson (Provincial Names of British Birds), this is the Red-backed
  Shrike (<i>Lanius collurio</i>), called in Yorkshire the Weirangle or
  Wariangle. Some make it the Great Grey Shrike (<i>Lanius excubitor</i>).
  Thus Ray, in his Provincial Words, ed. 1674, p. 83, gives
  <i>warringle</i> as a name for the Great Butcher-bird in the Peak of
  Derbyshire. 'This Bird,' says Willughby, 'in the North of England is
  called <i>Wierangle</i>, a name, it seems, common to us with the Germans,
  who (as Gesner witnesseth) about Strasburg, Frankfort, and elsewhere,
  call it <i>Werkangel</i> or <i>Warkangel</i>, perchance (saith he) as it
  were <i>Wurchangel</i>, which literally rendered signifies "a suffocating
  angel."' So also, the mod. G. name is <i>Würgengel</i>, as if from
  <i>würgen</i> and <i>Engel</i>. But this is a form <!-- Page 326 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>[326]</span>due to popular
  etymology, as will presently appear. Cotgrave has '<i>Pie engrouée</i>, a
  Wariangle, or a small Woodpecker'; but a wariangle is really a Shrike;
  indeed Cotgrave also has: '<i>Arneat</i>, the ravenous birde called a
  Shrike, Nynmurder, Wariangle'; which is correct. In the Wars of
  Alexander, ed. Skeat, l. 1706, the word <i>wayryngle</i> occurs as a term
  of abuse, signifying 'a little villain'; this is probably the same word,
  and answers to a dimin. form of A.&nbsp;S. <i>wearg</i> (Icel. <i>vargr</i>,
  O. H. G. <i>warg</i>, <i>warc</i>), a felon, with the suffix <i><span
  class="nw">-incel</span></i>, as seen in A.&nbsp;S. <i>r&#x101;p-incel</i>, a
  little rope, <i>h&#x16B;s-incel</i>, a little house. Bradley cites, as
  parallel forms, the O. H. G. <i>warchengil</i> (see below), and the M. L.
  G. <i>wargingel</i>, which are probably formed in a similar way. The
  epithet 'little felon' or 'little murderer' agrees with other names for
  the shrike, viz. 'butcher-bird,' 'murdering-bird,' 'nine-murder,'
  nine-killer,' so called because it impales beetles and small birds on
  thorns, for the purpose of pulling them to pieces. This is why I take
  <i>venim</i> to mean 'spite' rather than 'poison' in this passage.</p>

  <p>Schmeller, in his Bavarian Dict., ii. 999, says that the <i>Lanius
  excubitor</i> is called, in O. H. G. glosses, <i>Warchengel</i> (Graff,
  i. 349); also <i>Wargengel</i>, <i>Würgengel</i>, and <i>Würger</i>.</p>

  <p>1413. <i>north contree.</i> This is a sly joke, because, in the old
  Teutonic mythology, hell was supposed to be in the <i>north</i>. Wright
  refers us, for this belief, to his St. Patrick's Purgatory. See my note
  to P. Plowman, C. ii. 111, about Lucifer's sitting <i>in the north</i>;
  cf. Isaiah, xiv. 13, 14; Milton, P.&nbsp;L. v. 755-760; Myrour of our Lady,
  ed. Blunt, p. 189. In the Icelandic Gylfaginning, we find&mdash;'niðr ok
  norðr liggr Helvegr,' i.&nbsp;e. downwards and northwards lies the way to
  hell. Cf. l. 1448.</p>

  <p>1428. <i>laborous</i> is right; <i>offyc-e</i> is trisyllabic.</p>

  <p>1436. A proverbial expression; still in use in Lancashire and
  elsewhere; see N. and Q., 7 S. x. 446, 498. Cf. 'a taker and a bribing
  [robbing] feloe, and one for whom nothing was <i>to hotte nor to
  heauie</i>.' Udall, tr. of Erasmus' Apophthegmes; Cicero, § 50.</p>

  <p>Of course the sense is&mdash;'too hot to hold.' Tyrwhitt quotes a
  similar phrase from Froissart, v. i. c. 229, 'ne laissoient riens a
  prendre, s'il n'estoit <i>trop chaud</i>, trop froid, ou <i>trop
  pesant</i>.'</p>

  <p>1456. Read <i>ben'cite</i>; and observe the rime: <i>prey-e</i>,
  <i>sey ye</i>. Pronounce: (prei·y&#x259;, sei·y&#x259;), where (&#x259;)
  represents the obscure vowel, or the <i>a</i> in <i>China</i>. <!-- Page
  327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>[327]</span></p>

  <p>1459. Such questions were eagerly discussed in the middle ages; see l.
  1461-5.</p>

  <p>1463. <i>make yow seme</i>, make it seem to you. Tyrwhitt has
  <i>wene</i> (for <i>seme</i>), which occurs in MS. Cp. only.</p>

  <p>1467. <i>iogelour</i>, juggler; for their tricks, see F. 1143. Wright
  says:&mdash;'The <i>jogelour</i> (<i>joculator</i>) was originally the
  minstrel, and at an earlier period was an important member of society. He
  always combined mimicry and mountebank performances with poetry and
  music. In Chaucer's time he had so far degenerated as to have become a
  mere mountebank, and as it appears, to have merited the energetic epithet
  here applied to him.' Cf. my note to P. Plowman, C. xvi. 207.</p>

  <p>1472. Read <i>abl' is</i>. MS. Hl. has:&mdash;'As most abíl is our-e
  pray to take.' Cf. F. <i>habile</i>, for which Cotgrave gives one meaning
  as 'apt unto anything he undertakes.'</p>

  <p>1476. <i>pryme</i>, 9 A.M., a late time with early risers. See note to
  B. 4045, p. 250.</p>

  <p>1483-91. Cf. Boeth. bk. iv. pr. 6. 62-71; Job, i. 12; ii. 6.</p>

  <p>1502. I suspect this to be an allusion to a story similar to that
  entitled 'A Lay of St. Dunstan' in the Ingoldsby Legends.</p>

  <p>1503. This probably alludes to some of the legends about the apostles.
  Thus, in The Lives of Saints, ed. Horstmann, p. 36, l. 72, some fiends
  are represented as doing the will of St. James the Greater; and in the
  same, p. 368, l. 50, a fiend says of St. Bartholomew:&mdash;'He mai do
  with us al that he wole, for bi-neothe him we beoth.' Cf. Acts, xix.
  15.</p>

  <p>1508. 'The adoption of the bodies of the deceased by evil spirits in
  their wanderings upon earth, was an important part of the medieval
  superstitions of this country, and enters largely into a variety of
  legendary stories found in the old chroniclers.'&mdash;Wright. Bell
  quotes from Hamlet, ii. 2:&mdash;'The spirit that I have seen May be the
  devil,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1509. <i>renably</i>, reasonably. The A. F. form of 'reasonable' was
  <i>resnable</i> (as in the Life of Edw. the Confessor, l. 1602); and, by
  the law that <i>s</i> became silent before <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, and
  <i>n</i> (as in <i>isle</i>, <i>blasmer</i>, <i>disner</i>, E.
  <i>isle</i>, <i>blame</i>, <i>dine</i>), this became <i>renable</i>. See
  note to P. Plowman, C. i. 176.</p>

  <p>1510. <i>Phitonissa</i>; this is another spelling of
  <i>pythonissa</i>, which is the word used, in the Vulgate version of 1
  Chron. x. 13, with reference to the witch of Endor. In 1 Sam. xxviii. 7,
  the phrase is <i>mulier pythonem habens</i>. The witch of Endor is also
  called <i>phitonesse</i> in Gower, Conf. Amant. bk. iv, ed. Pauli, ii.
  66; Barbour's Bruce, iv. 753; Skelton's Philip Sparowe, l. 1345;
  Lydgate's Falls of Princes, bk. ii. leaf xl, ed. Wayland; Gawain Douglas,
  prol. to the Æneid, ed. Small, ii. 10, l. 2; and in Sir D. Lyndesay's

  satirical.</p>

  <p>1519. Referring to Vergil's Æneid, bk. vi, and Dante's Inferno.</p>

  <p>1541. <i>for which</i>, for which reason; <i>stood</i>, stood still,
  was stuck fast.</p>

  <p>1543. In Brand's Popular Antiquities, ed. Ellis, ii. 15, '<i>Heit</i>
  or <i>Heck</i>' is mentioned as being 'a well-known interjection used by
  the country people to their horses.' Brand adds that 'the name of
  <i>Brok</i> is still, too, in frequent use amongst farmers' draught
  oxen.' In the Towneley Mysteries, p. 9, is the exclamation '<i>hyte!</i>'
  The word for '<i>stop!</i>' was '<i>ho!</i>' like the modern <i>whoa!</i>
  This explains a line in Gascoigne's Dan Bartholmew of Bathe, ed. Hazlitt,
  i. 136:&mdash;'His thought sayd <i>haight</i>, his sillie speache cryed
  <i>ho</i>.' Bell notes that '<i>Hayt</i> is still the word used by
  waggoners in Norfolk, to make their horses go on'; and
  adds&mdash;'<i>Brok</i> means a badger, hence applied to a gray horse,
  <i>myne owene lyard boy</i> (l. 1563). <i>Scot</i> is a common name for
  farm-horses in East-Anglia; as in A. 616.' In the Towneley Mysteries, p.
  9, names of oxen are <i>Malle</i>, <i>Stott</i> (doubtless miswritten for
  <i>Scott</i>), <i>Lemyng</i>, <i>Morelle</i>, and <i>White-horne</i>. The
  Craven Glossary says <i>hyte</i> is used to turn horses to the left;
  whilst the Ger. <i>hott!</i> or <i>hottot!</i> is used to turn them to
  the right. In Shropshire, <i>'ait</i> or <i>'eet</i>, said to horses,
  means 'go from me'; see <i>Waggoners' Words</i> in Miss Jackson's
  Shropsh. Wordbook.</p>

  <p>1548. MS. Hl. has&mdash;'her schal we <i>se play</i>.' Tyrwhitt has
  <i>pray</i>, which gives a false rime, for it should be <i>prey-e</i>;
  see l. 1455, and the note to l. 1456. The six MSS. all have <i>a
  pley</i>.</p>

  <p>1559. <i>thakketh</i> (pronounced <i>thakk'th</i>) <i>his hors</i>,
  pats, or strokes his horses; to encourage them. From A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>þaccian</i>, to stroke (a horse), Gregory's Pastoral Care, ed. Sweet,
  p. 303, l. 10. So also in A. 3304. (Not to <i>thwack</i>, or
  <i>whack</i>.)</p>

  <p>1560. I adopt the reading of MSS. E. and Hn. MSS. Cm. Pt. Ln.
  have:&mdash;'And they bigunne to drawe and to stoupe,' which throws an
  awkward accent on the former <i>to</i>. MS. Hl. has:&mdash;'And thay
  bygon to drawen and to stowpe.' But I take <i>to-stoupe</i> to be a
  compound verb, with the sense 'stoop forward'; though I can find no other
  example of its use. Being uncommon, it would easily have been resolved
  into two words, and this would necessitate the introduction of <i>to</i>
  before <i>drawen</i>. <i>Bigonne</i> usually takes <i>to</i> after it,
  but not always; cf. 'Iapen tho bigan,' B. 1883.</p>

  <p>1563. <i>twight</i>, pulled, lit. 'twitched.' '<i>Liard</i>, a common
  appellative for a horse, from its <i>grey</i> colour, as <i>bayard</i>
  was from <i>bay</i> (see A. 4115). See P. Plowman, C. xx. 64 [and my note
  on the same]. Bp. Douglas, in his <i>Virgil</i>, usually puts
  <i>liart</i> for <i>albus</i>, <i>incanus</i>, &amp;c.'&mdash;T. Other
  names of horses are, <i>Favel</i> for a chestnut, <i>Dun</i> for a dun
  horse, <i>Ferrand</i> for an iron-gray, and <i>Morel</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
  mulberry-coloured, for a roan.</p>

  <p>1564. I give the reading of MSS. Hn. Cp. Pt. Ln., and of the
  black-letter editions. MS. Hl. has 'I pray god saue thy body and seint
  loy'; for which Cm. has 'the body,' as if 'the' were the original
  reading, and 'body' a supplied word. I take <i>se-ynt</i> to be
  dissyllabic, as in A. 120, 509, 697, D. 604. As to <i>seint Loy</i>, the
  patron-saint of goldsmiths, farriers, smiths, and carters, see note to A.
  120. <!-- Page 329 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page329"></a>[329]</span></p>

  <p>1568. Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 10335-6: 'car ge fesoie Une chose, et autre
  pensoie.'</p>

  <p>1570. <i>upon cariage</i>, by way of quitting my claim to this cart
  and team; a satirical reflection on his failure to win anything by the
  previous occurrence. <i>Cariage</i> was a technical term for a service of
  carrying, or a payment in lieu of it, due from a tenant to his landlord
  or feudal superior; see the New Eng. Dictionary, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Carriage</i>,
  I. 4. The landlord used to claim the use of the tenant's horses and carts
  for his own service, without payment for the use of them; and the tenant
  could only get off by paying <i>cariage</i>. This difficult use of the
  word is exemplified by two other passages in Chaucer, one of which is in
  the Cant. Tales, I. 752; q.v. The other is in his Boethius, bk. i. pr. 4,
  l. 50, where he says:&mdash;'The poeple of the provinces ben harmed
  outher by privee ravynes, or by comune tributes or <i>cariages</i>,'
  where the Lat. text has <i>uectigalibus</i>.</p>

  <p>1573. <i>rebekke</i>, old woman; lit. Rebecca; see note to l. 1377
  above.</p>

  <p>1576. Twelve pence was a considerable sum in those days; being
  equivalent to something like fifteen shillings of our present money.</p>

  <p>1580. <i>winne thy cost</i>, earn your expenses.</p>

  <p>1582. <i>viritrate</i>, a term of contempt for an old woman. Cf. 'thou
  olde <i>trot</i>,' addressed to an old woman; Thersites, in Hazlitt's Old
  Plays, i. 415. Jamieson gives <i>trat</i>, an old woman; with three
  examples from G. Douglas. Levins (1570) has: 'Tratte, <i>anus</i>.'</p>

  <p>1591. <i>wisly</i>, certainly. <i>I ne may</i>, I cannot (come).</p>

  <p>1593. <i>go</i>, walk; as usual, when used with <i>ryde</i>.</p>

  <p>1595. <i>axe a libel</i>, apply to have a written declaration of the
  complaint against me, i.&nbsp;e. a copy of the indictment.</p>

  <p>1596. <i>procutour</i>, proctor, to appear on my behalf. Only MS. Hl.
  has the full form <i>procuratour</i>; the rest have <i>procutour</i> or
  <i>procatour</i>, as suitable for the metre. These forms are interesting,
  as furnishing the intermediate step between <i>procurator</i> and
  <i>proctor</i>. So, in the Prompt. Parv., we find 'proketowre,
  <i>Procurator</i>,' and 'prokecye, <i>Procuracia</i>'; whence, by loss of
  <i>e</i>, <i>proctor</i> and <i>proxy</i>. <i>there</i> is dissyllabic,
  as in A. 3165, and frequently.</p>

  <p>1613. <i>Seinte Anne</i>, saint Anna, whose day is July 26. In Luke,
  ii. 36, is mentioned 'Anna the prophetess.' At the commencement of the
  apocryphal gospel of Mary, we are told that the virgin's 'father's name
  was Joachim, and her mother's Anna.' This is the saint Anna here alluded
  to. See B. 641; G. 70; and Cursor Mundi, l. 10147. Hence it became a
  common practice to give a girl the name of Mary Ann, which combined the
  name of the virgin with that of her mother.</p>

  <p>1617. <i>I payde</i>, and which I paid.</p>

  <p>1618. <i>lixt</i>, liest; a common form; see P. Plowman, C. vii. 138
  (B. v. 163); Plowman's Crede, 542.</p>

  <p>1630. <i>stot</i>, properly a stallion (as in A. 615), or a bullock;
  also applied, as in the Cleveland Glossary, to an old ox. Here it clearly
  means 'old cow,' as a term of abuse. <!-- Page 330 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>[330]</span></p>

  <p>1635. <i>by right</i>; because the old woman really meant it; cf. l.
  1568.</p>

  <p>1644. <i>leve</i>, grant. Tyrwhitt wrongly has <i>lene</i>, lend. The
  difference between these two words, which are constantly confused (being
  written <i>leue</i>, <i>lene</i>, often indistinguishably) is explained
  in my note to P. Plowman, B. v. 263. <i>Leue</i> (grant, permit) is
  usually followed by a dependent clause; but <i>lene</i> (lend, grant,
  give) by an accusative case.</p>

  <p>1647. I supply <i>and</i> to fill up the line. This <i>and</i> appears
  in all the modern editions, but <i>without authority, and without any
  notice that the MSS. omit it</i>. Yet it neither appears in any one of
  our seven MSS. nor in MSS. Dd., Ii., or Mm. Neither does it appear in the
  black-letter editions. Indeed MS. E. marks the scansion thus: After the
  text of Crist | Poul | and John; as if the word 'Poul' occupied a whole
  foot of the verse. And I can readily believe that the line was meant to

<p class="ac"><b>The Sompnour's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>1676. The words of St. Paul, 2 Cor. xii. 4, have suggested numerous
  accounts of revelations made to saints regarding heaven and hell. In
  Bede's Eccl. History, bk. iii. c. 19, we are told how St. Furseus saw a
  vision of hell; so also did St. Guthlac, as related in his life, cap. 5.
  A long vision of purgatory is recounted in the Revelation to the Monk of
  Evesham, ed. Arber; and another in the account of St. Patrick's
  Purgatory, in the Lives of Saints, ed. Horstmann. Long descriptions of
  hell are common, as in the Cursor Mundi, l. 23195, and Hampole's Pricke
  of Conscience, l. 6464. But the particular story to which Chaucer here
  alludes is, probably, not elsewhere extant.</p>

  <p>1688. Possibly Chaucer was thinking of the wings of Lucifer, greater
  than any sails, as described in Dante's Inferno, xxxiv. 48; whence also
  Milton speaks of Satan's 'sail-broad vans,' P.&nbsp;L. ii. 927. A
  <i>carrik</i> or <i>carrack</i> is a large trading-ship, and we have here
  the earliest known example of the use of the word in English; see
  <i>Carrack</i> in the New Eng. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>1690-1. Cf. Rom. of the Rose, 7577-8; in vol. i. p. 257.</p>

  <p>1695. Line 2119 of the House of Fame is: 'Twenty thousand in a route';
  here we have the same line with the addition of <i>freres</i>. <!-- Page
  331 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>[331]</span>Both lines
  are cast in the same mould, both being deficient in the first foot. Thus
  the scansion is: Twen | ty thou | sand, &amp;c. In order to conceal this
  fact, Tyrwhitt reads: '<i>A</i> twenty thousand,' &amp;c., against all
  authority; but Wright, Bell, Morris, and Gilman all allow the line to
  stand as Chaucer wrote it, and as it is here given. The black-letter
  editions do the same. It is a very small matter that all the copies
  except E. have <i>on</i> for <i>in</i>; as the words are equivalent, I
  keep <i>in</i> (as in E.), because <i>in</i> is the reading in the Hous
  of Fame.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Somnours Tale.</b></p>

  <p>For further remarks about this Tale, see vol. iii. p. 452.</p>

  <p>It is principally directed against the Frere; see the description of
  him in the Prologue, A. 208.</p>

  <p>1710. Holderness is an extremely flat district; it lies at the S. E.
  angle of Yorkshire, between Hull, Driffield, Bridlington and Spurn Point;
  see the Holderness Glossary, E. D. S. 1877. We find that Chaucer makes no
  attempt here, as in the Reeve's Tale, to imitate the Yorkshire
  dialect.</p>

  <p>1712. <i>to preche.</i> The friars were popular preachers of the
  middle ages. They were to live by begging, and were therefore often
  called the Mendicant Orders; see l. 1912, and the notes to A. 208, 209.
  The friar of our story was a <i>Carmelite</i>; see note to l. 2116.</p>

  <p>1717. <i>trentals.</i> A <i>trental</i> (from Low Lat.
  <i>trentale</i>, O. F. <i>trentel</i>) was an office of thirty masses, to
  be said on so many consecutive days, for the benefit of souls in
  purgatory. It also meant, as here, the sum paid for the same to the
  priest or friar. See Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 299, 374; ed.
  Matthew (E. E. T. S.) pp. 211, 516; and the poem entitled St. Gregory's
  Trental, in Religious, Political, and Love Poems, ed. Furnivall, p.
  83.</p>

  <p>1722. <i>possessioners.</i> This term seems to have been applied (1)
  to the regular orders of monks who possessed landed property, and (2) to
  the beneficed clergy. I think there is here particular reference to the
  latter, as indicated by the occurrence of <i>preest</i> in l. 1727,
  <i>curat</i> in 1816, and <i>viker</i> and <i>persone</i> in l. 2008. The
  friars, on the contrary, were supposed to have no endowments, but to
  subsist entirely upon alms; they contrived, however, to evade this
  restriction, and in Pierce the Plowman's Crede, there is a description of
  a Dominican convent built with considerable splendour. I take the
  expression 'Thanked be god' in l. 1723 to be a parenthentical remark made
  by the Somnour who tells the story, as it is hardly consistent with the
  views of the friars. As to the perpetual jealousies between the friars
  and the possessioners, see P. Plowman, B. v. 144.</p>

  <p>1728. It was usual (as said in note to l. 1717) to sing the thirty
  masses on thirty consecutive days, as Chaucer here remarks. But the friar
  says they are better when 'hastily y-songe'; and it would appear <!--
  Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>[332]</span>that
  the friars used occasionally to sing all the thirty masses in one day,
  and so save a soul from twenty-nine days of purgatory; cf. ll. 1729,
  1732. In English Gilds, ed. Toulmin Smith, p. 8, we have an example of
  this. The wardens are there directed to summon the Minorite Friars to say
  the dirge, 'and <i>on the morwe</i> to seie a <i>trent</i> of masses atte
  same freres.'</p>

  <p>In Jack Upland, § 13, we find: 'Why make ye [freres] men beleeue that
  your golden trentall sung of you, to take therefore ten shillings, or at
  least fiue shillings, woll bring souls out of hell, or out of
  purgatorie?'</p>

  <p>1730. <i>oules.</i> The M. E. forms <i>oule</i>, <i>owel</i>,
  <i>owul</i>, as well as A. S. <i>awul</i>, <i>awel</i>, are various
  spellings of E. <i>awl</i>, which see in the New Eng. Dict. Hence
  <i>oules</i> means <i>awls</i> or piercing instruments. In the Life of
  St. Katherine, l. 2178, the tormentors torture the saint with 'eawles of
  irne,' i.&nbsp;e. iron awls. In Horstmann's South-English Legendary (E. E. T.
  S.), St. Blase is tormented with 'oules kene,' which tore his flesh as
  when men comb wool (p. 487, l. 84); hence he became the patron saint of
  wool-combers. Similar tortures were applied by fiends in the medieval
  descriptions of hell. See Ancren Riwle, p. 212; St. Brandan, ed. Wright,
  pp. 22, 48.</p>

  <p>1734. <i>qui cum patre.</i> 'This is part of the formula with which
  prayers and sermons are still sometimes concluded in the Church of
  England.'&mdash;Bell. In a sermon for Ascension Day, in Morris's O.&nbsp;E.
  Homilies, ii. 115, we have at the end an allusion, in English, to Christ,
  after which follows:&mdash;'qui cum patre et spiritu sancto uiuit et
  regnat per omnia secula seculorum.' Such was the usual formula.</p>

  <p>1740. The friars often begged in pairs; in this way, each was a check
  upon the other as regarded the things thus obtained. In Jack Upland, §
  23, we find the friars are asked:&mdash;'What betokeneth that ye goe
  tweine and tweine togither?' Langland tells us how he met two friars; see
  P. Plowman, C. xi. 8.</p>

  <p>1741. <i>tables</i>, writing tablets. In Horman's Vulgaria, leaf 81,
  we read:&mdash;'Tables be made of leues of yuery, boxe, cyprus, and other
  stouffe, daubed with waxe to wrytte on.' And again, in the
  same:&mdash;'Poyntellis of yron, and poyntyllis of syluer, bras, boon, or
  stoone.' This is a survival of the use of the Roman waxed tablet and
  <i>stilus</i>.</p>

  <p>1743. Jack Upland (§ 20) asks the friar:&mdash;'Why writest thou hir
  names in thy tables that yeueth thee mony?' The usual reason was, that
  the donors might be prayed for; see l. 1745. Cf. l. 1752.</p>

  <p>1745. <i>Ascaunces</i>, as if, as though, as if to promise. In G. 838,
  q.v., it means 'you might suppose that,' or 'possibly.' In Troilus, i.
  205, it means 'as if to say'; Boccaccio's Italian has <i>quasi
  dicesse</i>. It also occurs in Troilus, i. 292; Lydgate, Fall of Princes,
  fol. 136 b (Tyrwhitt); <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>[333]</span>Tale of Beryn, 1797; Palladius on
  Husbandry, vi. 39; Sidney's Arcadia, ed. 1622, p. 162; and in Gascoigne's
  Works, ed. Hazlitt, i. 113, where the marginal note has 'as who should
  say.' See the New Eng. Dictionary, where the etymology is said to be
  unknown.</p>

  <p>I have since found that it is a hybrid compound. The first part of it
  is E. <i>as</i>, used superflously and tautologically; the latter part of
  it is the O.&nbsp;F. <i>quanses</i>, 'as if,' first given in a dictionary by
  Godefroy in 1889, with six examples, and three other spellings, viz.
  <i>qanses</i>, <i>quainses</i>, and <i>queinsi</i>. Godefroy refers us to
  Romania, xviii. 152, and to Foerster's edition of <i>Cliges</i>, note to
  l. 4553. Kilian gives Mid. Du. '<i>quantsuys</i>, quasi'; borrowed from
  O. French, without any prefix.</p>

  <p>1746. Nothing came amiss to the friars. They begged for 'corn, monee,
  chese,' &amp;c.; see Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, p. 304. And in
  Skelton's Colin Clout, l. 842, we read of the friars:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Some to gather chese;</p>

      <p>Somtyme a bacon-flycke,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>1747. <i>Goddes</i> here translated the French expression <i>de
  Dieu</i>, meaning 'sent from God.' Tyrwhitt says that the true meaning of
  <i>de Dieu</i> 'is explained by M. de la Monnoye in a note upon the
  <i>Contes de D. B. Periers</i>, t. ii. p. 107. <i>Belle serrure de
  Dieu</i>: Expression du petit peuple, qui raporte pieusement tout à Dieu.
  Rien n'est plus commun dans la bouche des bonnes vieilles, que ces
  espèces d'Hébraïsmes: <i>Il m'en conte un bel écu de Dieu; Il ne me reste
  que ce pauvre enfant de Dieu. Donnez-moi une bénite aumône de Dieu.</i>
  See <i>goddes halfpeny</i> in l. 1749. (The explanation by Speght, and in
  Cowel's Interpreter, s.&nbsp;v. <i>kichell</i>, seems to be, as Tyrwhitt says,
  an invention.)</p>

  <p><i>kechil</i>, a little cake. The form <i>kechell</i> occurs in the
  Ormulum, l. 8662; answering to the early A.&nbsp;S. <i>coecil</i>, occurring
  as a gloss to <i>tortum</i> in the Epinal Glossary, 993; different from
  A.&nbsp;S. <i>c&#x12B;cel</i> (for <i>c&#x233;cel</i>), given as <i>cicel</i>
  in Bosworth's Dictionary. The cognate M. H. G. word is
  <i>küechel&#x12B;n</i> (Schade), O. H. G. <i>chuochel&#x12B;n</i>, double
  dimin. from O. H. G. <i>kuocho</i> (G. <i>Kuchen</i>), a cake; see
  <i>Kuchen</i> in Kluge. The E. <i>cake</i> is a related word, but with a
  difference in vowel-gradation.</p>

  <p><i>trip</i>, 'a morsel.' 'Les <i>tripes</i> d'un fagot, the smallest
  sticks in a faggot'; Cotgrave.</p>

  <p>1749. <i>masse-peny</i>, a penny for saying a mass. Jack Upland, § 19,
  says:&mdash;'Freer, whan thou receiuest a peny for to say a masse,
  whether sellest thou Gods body for that peny, or thy prayer, or els thy
  travell?'</p>

  <p>1751. '<i>dagon</i>, a slip, or piece. It is found in Chaucer,
  Berners, and Steevens' Supp. to Dugdale, ii. ap. 370, applied in each
  instance to a blanket'; Halliwell. Cf. M.&nbsp;E. <i>dagge</i>, a strip of
  cloth.</p>

  <p>1755. <i>hostes man</i>, servant to the guests at the convent.
  <i>Hoste</i> seems here to mean 'guest,' which is one of the meanings of
  O.&nbsp;F. <i>hoste</i> (see <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page334"></a>[334]</span>Cotgrave). This sense is rare in M.&nbsp;E.,
  but it occurs in the Romance of Merlin, ed. Wheatley, iii. 684, last line
  but one. Because he 'bare the bag,' this attendant on the friars was
  nicknamed Iscariot; cf. John, xii. 6. 'Thei leden with hem a Scarioth,
  stolen fro is eldris by thefte, to robbe pore men bi beggynge'; Wyclif's
  Works, ed. Matthew, p. 49.</p>

  <p>1768. <i>the gode man</i>, the goodman, or master of the house. MS.
  Hl. has <i>housbond-man</i>, and MSS. Cp. Ln. <i>bonde man</i>; all with
  the same sense. <i>place</i>, house; cf. note to B. 1910; p. 184.</p>

  <p>1770. <i>Deus hic</i>, God be here; 'the ordinary formula of
  benediction on entering a house'; Wright.</p>

  <p>1775. A fine realistic touch; the friar made himself quite at
  home.</p>

  <p>1778. <i>go walked</i>, gone on a walk. For <i>go walked</i>, as in
  all the seven MSS., Tyrwhitt substitutes <i>y-walked</i>, suppressing
  this characteristic idiom. See note to C. 406; p. 272.</p>

  <p>1792. <i>glose</i>, gloss, interpretation, as distinguished from the
  text.</p>

  <p>1794. Cf. 2 Cor. iii. 6. In the margin of E., 'Litera occidit,
  &amp;c.'</p>

  <p>1804. Kissing was an ordinary form of salutation.</p>

  <p>1810. It was usual, I believe, to use a form of deprecation of this
  sort in reply to praise. The sense is&mdash;'but I am aware that I have
  defects, and may God amend them.'</p>

  <p>1816. <i>curats</i>, parish clergy; cf. note to l. 1722.</p>

  <p>1820. Cf. 'thou shalt catch men'; Luke, v. 10; 'fishers of men,' Matt.
  iv. 19; Rom. Rose, (E. version), 7492.</p>

  <p>1824. 'For (the sake of the) holy Trinity.' <i>Seint-e</i> is
  feminine.</p>

  <p>1825. <i>pissemyre</i>, ant. Cf. 'as angry as a wasp,' in Heywood's
  Proverbs.</p>

  <p>1832. <i>Ie vous dy</i>, I tell you. A common phrase; see King
  Alisaunder, ed. Weber, l. 79; Rom. of the Rose, 7408 (in vol. i. p.
  254).</p>

  <p>1834. <i>ire</i> (Lat. <i>ira</i>) is one of the seven deadly sins;
  hence the friar's sermon against it, in ll. 2005-2088.</p>

  <p>1842. 'But I hope no animal is ever killed on my account.' A strong
  hint that he always expected some special provision to be made for
  him.</p>

  <p>1845. Cf. John, iv. 34; Job, xxiii. 12.</p>

  <p>1853. <i>toun</i>, village; or, precincts of this farm-house.</p>

  <p>1857. Visions of saints being carried to heaven are not uncommon. Bede
  relates one, of Saint Earcongota; Eccl. Hist. bk. iii. c. 8.</p>

  <p>1859. <i>fermerer</i>, the friar who had charge of the infirmary. Put
  for <i>enfermerer</i>, from O. Fr. <i>enfermerier</i> (Godefroy). So also
  <i>fermorie</i>, an infirmary, in P. Pl. B. xiii. 108.</p>

  <p>1862. <i>maken hir Iubilee</i>, keep their jubilee; i.&nbsp;e. having
  served fifty years in the convent, they have obtained certain privileges,
  one of which was to go about alone; see note to l. 1740. Tyrwhitt refers
  us to Ducange, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Sempectæ</i>.</p>

  <p>1864. <i>trikling</i>, so E. Hn.; Cm. <i>trynkelynge</i> (probably by
  error); rest <i>trilling</i>. Cf. B. 1864.</p>

  <p>1866. 'Nothing but a thanksgiving would have been appropriate for <!--
  Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335"></a>[335]</span>a
  child dying in infancy, of whose translation to paradise the friar
  pretends that he had seen a vision'; Bell.</p>

  <p>1872. <i>burel</i> (Pt. Hl. <i>borel</i>) <i>folk</i>, lay folk, the
  laity. 'The term seems to have arisen from the material of their
  clothing, which was not used by the clergy'; Wright. Cf. <i>borel</i>, in
  D. 356; <i>borel men</i>, i.&nbsp;e. laymen, in B. 3145; and <i>borel
  clerkes</i>, lay clerks, learned laymen, in P. Plowman, B. x. 286.</p>

  <p>1877. See Luke, xvi. 19, 20.</p>

  <p>1880. In the margin of E., 'Melius est animam saginare quam corpus.'
  Jean de Meun, in his Testament, 346, says of misers: 'Amegrient leurs
  ames, plus que leurs cors n'engressent.'</p>

  <p>1881. See 1 Tim. vi. 8.</p>

  <p>1885. See Exod. xxxiv. 28.</p>

  <p>1890. See 1 Kings, xix. 8.</p>

  <p>1894. See Levit. x. 9.</p>

  <p>1906. <i>mendinants</i>, mendicant friars. Tyrwhitt has
  <i>mendiants</i>, but, in his notes, admits that <i>mendinants</i> is the
  right reading, as he found the word to be 'constantly so spelled in the
  Stat. 12 Rich. II. capp. 7, 8, 9, 10.' The same spelling occurs
  repeatedly in P. Plowman; see note to P. Pl. C. xvi. 3. See
  <i>Mendiener</i>, to beg, in Godefroy's O. Fr. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>1911. 'The thridde deceyt of thise ordris is that thei passen othere
  in preyeris, bothe for tyme thei preyen and for multitude of hem';
  Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, p. 317.</p>

  <p>1915-7. See note to C. 505; p. 278.</p>

  <p>1923. See Matt. v. 3. <i>by freres</i>, (1922), concerning friars.
  Certainly, there is no 'text' to this effect; but the friar trusted to
  find it <i>in a maner glose</i>, in some kind of comment on the text.</p>

  <p>1926. An allusion to <i>possessioners</i>; see note to l. 1722.</p>

  <p>1929. <i>Iovinian.</i> I think this is the same Jovinian as is
  mentioned in D. 675; for Chaucer frequently quotes the treatise by Jerome
  against this heretic. Gibbon, in his Decline and Fall of the Roman
  Empire, ch. 30, refers in a footnote to 'Jovinian, <i>the enemy of fasts
  and of celibacy</i>, who was persecuted and insulted by the furious
  Jerome.' The other Jovinian was a fabulous Roman emperor, who was awhile
  deposed, like Nebuchadnezzar, for his pride and luxury, as related in the
  Gesta Romanorum, cap. 59 (or chapter 23 in the English version).</p>

  <p><i>walkinge as a swan</i>, i.&nbsp;e. with slow and stately gait. Jerome
  (Contra Iovin. i. 40) calls Jovinian 'iste formosus monachus, crassus,
  nitidus, et <i>quasi sponsus</i> semper <i>incedens</i>.'</p>

  <p>1931. 'All as full of wine as a bottle in the buttery.'</p>

  <p>1932. For <i>gret</i>, ed. 1550 has <i>lytle</i>; but, as Tyrwhitt
  remarks, the expression is ironical.</p>

  <p>1933. <i>Davit</i> is put for <i>David</i>, for the rime. MSS. E. Hn.
  Ln. have <i>Dauit</i>; Cm. <i>dauith</i>; Cp. Hl. <i>dauid</i>; Pt.
  <i>davyd</i>.</p>

  <p>1934. <i>Lo but</i> is the reading of MS. E. But the right reading is
  probably <i>buf</i>, not <i>but</i>. The readings are; E. <i>but</i>; Hn.
  Cm. Ln. <i>buf</i>; <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page336"></a>[336]</span>Cp. <i>buff</i>; Pt. <i>boþ</i> (wrongly);
  Hl. <i>boef</i>; ed. 1550, <i>bouffe</i>. This gives the line in the
  following form:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Lo, 'buf!' they seye, '<i>cor meum eructavit!</i>'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here the interjectional '<i>buf!</i>' is probably intended to
  represent the sound of eructation. We find <i>baw!</i> as an interjection
  of strong contempt in P. Plowman, C. xiii. 74, xxii. 398.</p>

  <p>Ps. xlv (xliv in the Vulgate) begins, in Latin, with the words <i>Cor
  meum eructauit uerbum bonum</i>; and the Somnour here takes
  <i>eructauit</i> in the most literal sense.</p>

  <p>1935. <i>fore</i>, path, course; such is certainly the right reading,
  as in D. 110, on which see the note.</p>

  <p>1937. See James, i. 22.</p>

  <p>1938. <i>at a sours</i>, at a soaring, in her rise, in her upward
  swoop. The same word as <i>source</i> of a river; from F. <i>source</i>,
  O.&nbsp;F. <i>sorse</i>, the fem. pp. of the verb which arose from Lat.
  <i>surgere</i>. Most likely, this is the origin of the later
  <i>souse</i>, v., in the sense 'to swoop downward'; see Pope, Epilogue to
  Satires, Dial. ii. 15; Sh. K. John, v. 2. 150; Spenser, F. Q. i. 5. 8.
  See my note on the House of Fame, l. 544. In the Book of St. Alban's,
  fol. d 1, back, we find: 'Iff your hawke nym the fowle a-lofte, ye shall
  say, she toke it <i>at the mount</i> or <i>at the souce</i>'; where the
  <i>r</i> is dropped.</p>

  <p>1939. <i>their</i>, for <i>the eir</i>, the air; see footnote.</p>

  <p>1943. <i>Seint Yve</i>; see the note to B. 1417 (p. 172), with which
  this line entirely coincides.</p>

  <p>1944. 'If thou wert not our brother, thou wouldst not fare well'; see
  l. 1951.</p>

  <p>1947. <i>welden</i>, wield, have the full use of.</p>

  <p>1963-5. These lines are quoted by the friar as (supposed) ejaculations
  by Thomas.</p>

  <p>1968. In the margin of MS. E., 'Omnis virtus unita fortior est seipsa

  <p>1980. 'In the life of Thomas of India.' For this construction, see
  note to F. 209. St. Thomas the apostle is often so called, because he is
  said to have preached in India; and perhaps the tradition is true; see my
  note on P. Plowman, C. xxii. 165, and especially the remarks in Marco
  Polo, ed. Yule, ii. 292. Cf. note to E. 1230 (p. 353).</p>

  <p>How intent the friars were on building fine churches and convents for
  their own use, appears from Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, pp. 5, 14;
  Pierce the Plowman's Crede, 191; Jack Upland, § 10, and § 33; Skelton's
  Colin Clout, 936; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1986. 'As will be best for thee.' Tyrwhitt has <i>the</i> for
  <i>thy</i>; but <i>thy</i> is right. I find in the New E. Dict., s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>Best</i>, 8 b, a quotation from Sir E. Sandys, Europae Speculum
  (1637), 247: 'I have also, to <i>my best</i>, avoyded that rashnesse.'
  Cf. 'for your beste,' in B. 2427.</p>

  <p>1989. 'Be not as a lion in thy house, nor frantick among thy
  servants'; Ecclus. iv. 30. In the margin of MS. E. is the Vulgate version
  (Ecclus. iv. 35):&mdash;'Noli esse sicut leo in domo tua, euertens
  domesticos tuos, et opprimens subiectos tibi.'</p>

  <p>1993. <i>hir</i>, her; so in all the MSS. but Pt., which has
  <i>yre</i>. Tyrwhitt has wrongly taken <i>ire</i> as the reading, and
  Wright and Bell follow him, without giving any notice that MS. Hl. reads
  <i>hir</i>! But it makes all the difference; <i>hir</i> means 'thy wife';
  cf. ll. 1994-2004, all of which lines are robbed of their meaning by this
  insidious and uncalled-for alteration. Even ed. 1550 and ed. 1561 have
  <i>her</i>.</p>

  <p>It is easily seen how the error crept in, viz. from confusion with the
  friar's sermon against <i>ire</i>; but that does not really begin till we
  come to l. 2005.</p>

  <p>As this passage has been so grossly misunderstood, I annex an outline
  of the sense intended. 'Beware of thy wife; she is like the snake in the
  grass; remember how many men have lost their lives through their wives.
  But <i>your</i> wife is a meek one; then why strive? No serpent is so
  venomous as a provoked woman.' The fact is, that this passage is imitated
  from Le Roman de la Rose, 16779, &amp;c., where the author bids us beware
  of women, as being like Vergil's 'snake in the grass.' See next note.
  With ll. 2001-3 cf. Rom. de la Rose, 9832-6.</p>

  <p>1995. Cf. 'latet anguis in herba'; Vergil, Ecl. iii. 95. See F. 512,
  513. But Chaucer took this at second-hand, viz. from Le Roman de la Rose,
  l. 16793; and combined it with another passage from the same, 9832-6,
  which, in its turn, is copied from Ovid, Ars Amat. ii. 376:&mdash;'Nec
  breuis ignaro uipera laesa pede Femina quam,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>2002. <i>tret</i>, short for <i>tredeth</i>, treads. Cm. has
  <i>trat</i>. Cf. <i>hit</i>, hideth, F. 512; <i>rit</i>, rideth, A. 974;
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>2005. Here begins the sermon against <i>ire</i>. See the Persones

  chief of the seven Deadly Sins'; all of which are described in the
  Persones Tale; see I. 387.</p>

  <p>After l. 2004, MS. Hl. has two spurious lines, for which see the
  footnote. It is probable, however, that they are reminiscences of two
  <i>genuine</i> lines; for they occur in Le Rom. de la Rose, 16536-8.
  There are two more such after l. 2012, where the sense of <i>grate</i> is
  not obvious.</p>

  <p>2007. <i>himself</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the sinner. See Pers. Tale, I. 557.</p>

  <p>2009. <i>homicyde</i>; see this, in full, in the Pers. Tale, I.
  564-579.</p>

  <p>2010. 'Ire comth of pryde'; I. 534.</p>

  <p>2017. '<i>Potestat</i>, a chief magistrate'; Halliwell.
  '<i>Podestà</i>, a potestate, a mayor'; Florio. See Malory, Morte Arth.
  bk. v. c. 8.</p>

  <p>2018. <i>Senek</i>, Seneca. The story is given in Seneca's De Ira, i.
  16, beginning:&mdash;'Cn. Piso fuit memoria nostra, uir a multis uitiis
  integer, sed prauus,' &amp;c. It ends:&mdash;'Constituti sunt in eodem
  loco perituri tres, ob unius innocentiam.' This Piso was a governor of
  Syria under Tiberius. Precisely the same story is told, of the emperor
  Heraclius, in the Gesta Romanorum, cap. cxl. Warton gravely describes it
  in the words&mdash;'The emperor Eraclius reconciles (!) two knights.'</p>

  <p>2030-1. Wright says these two lines are not in Tyrwhitt, but he is
  mistaken. His note was meant to refer to the spurious lines (in MS. Hl.)
  after l. 2037; the former of which is <i>repeated</i> from l. 2030.</p>

  <p>2043. 'This story is also in Seneca, De Ira, lib. iii. c. 14. It
  differs a little from one in Herodotus, lib. iii.' [capp. 34,
  35].&mdash;Tyrwhitt. Seneca's story begins:&mdash;'Cambysen regem nimis
  deditum uino Praexaspes unus ex carissimis monebat.'</p>

  <p>2048. Here MS. Hl. inserts two more spurious lines, for the fourth
  time; see the footnote.</p>

  <p>2061. MSS. E. Hn. Cp. Ln. Dd. all insert <i>ful</i>, which is
  necessary to the rhythm. MSS. Pt. Hl. omit it, and actually read
  <i>dronk-e</i> (!), with an impossible final <i>e</i>. Tyrwhitt has
  <i>dranke</i>, omitting <i>ful</i>, and even Wright, Bell, and Morris
  have <i>dronk-e</i>, with the same omission. Owing to the carelessness of
  scribes, who often added an idle final <i>e</i>, such forms as
  <i>dranke</i>, <i>dronke</i> are not very astonishing. But it would be
  very curious to know <i>how these editors scanned this line</i>.</p>

  <p>2075. <i>Placebo.</i> 'The allusion is to an anthem in the Romish
  church, from Ps. cxvi. 9, which in the Vulgate [Ps. cxiv. 9] stands thus:
  <i>Placebo Domino in regione uiuorum</i>. Hence the <i>complacent</i>
  brother in the <i>Marchant's Tale</i> is called
  <i>Placebo</i>.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. Being used in the office for the dead,
  this anthem was familiar to every one; and 'to sing Placebo' came to mean
  'to be complaisant'; as in Bacon, Essay 20. See Pers. Tale, I. 617; and
  see my notes to P. Plowman, C. iv. 467 (B. iii. 307), B. xv. 122.</p>

  <p>2079. This story is also from Seneca, De Ira, lib. iii. c. 21. Cf.
  Herodotus, i. 189, 202; v. 52. In these authorities, the river is called
  the <i>Gyndes</i>; and in Alfred's translation of Orosius, bk. ii. c. 4,
  it is the <i>Gandes</i>. 'Sir John Maundeville (Travels, cap. 5) tells
  this story of the Euphrates.'&mdash;Wright. <!-- Page 339 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>[339]</span></p>

  <p>2085. <i>he</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Solomon; see Prov. xxii. 24, 25.</p>

  <p>2090. <i>as Iust as is a squire</i>, as exact (i.&nbsp;e. upright) as a
  square. He means that he will deal out exact justice, and not condone the
  sick man's anger without appointing him a penance for it. A <i>squire</i>
  is a measuring-square, or T-square, as explained in my Dictionary; it is
  used for measuring right angles with exactitude. For the use of the word,
  see Shak. L. L. L. v. 2. 474; Spenser, F.&nbsp;Q. ii. 1. 58; Minshew's Dict.;
  Romaunt of the Rose, 7064; Floris and Blancheflur, ed. Lumby, 325.
  Cotgrave gives: '<i>A l'esquierre</i>, justly, directly, evenly,
  straightly; by line and levell, to a haire.' Godefroy, s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>esquarre</i>, refers us to the O.&nbsp;F. translation of 1 Kings, v. 17; 'e
  que tuz fussent taillie <i>a esquire</i>.' Lydgate has: 'By compas cast,
  and squared out by <i>squyers</i>'; Siege of Troye, ed. 1555, fol. F 5,
  back, col. 1.</p>

  <p>2095. 'Thei [the friars] cryen faste that thei haf more power in
  confessioun then other curatis; for thei may schryve alle that comen to
  hem, bot curatis may no ferther then her owne parischens'; Wyclif's
  Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 374. Cf. Rom. Rose, 6390-8 (vol. i. 238).</p>

  <p>2098. So in I. 1008: 'but-if it lyke to thee of thyn humilitee.'</p>

  <p>2105. 'The pavements were made of encaustic tiles, and therefore must
  have been rather expensive.'&mdash;Wright. See my note to Pierce the
  Ploughman's Crede, l. 194; and Our English Home, p. 20.</p>

  <p>2107. 'For the sake of Him who harried hell'; see note to A. 3512; p.
  107.</p>

  <p>2116. <i>Elie</i>, Elias, Elijah. <i>Elisee</i>, Eliseus, Elisha.
  There was great strife among the four orders of friars as to the priority
  of their order. The Carmelites, who took their name from mount Carmel
  (see 1 Kings, xviii. 19, 20), actually pretended that their order was
  founded by the prophet Elijah when he retired to mount Carmel to escape
  the wrath of Ahab; and by this unsurpassable fiction secured to
  themselves the credit of priority to the rest. It is therefore clear that
  the friar of Chaucer's story was a <i>Carmelite</i>, as <i>no other</i>
  friar would have alluded to this story. See Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold,
  iii. 353; Pierce the Ploughman's Crede, 382.</p>

  <p>2119. <i>for seinte charitee</i>; a common expression. It occurs in
  the Tale of Gamelin, 513; with which Chaucer was familiar. Cf. B.
  4510.</p>

  <p>2126. <i>your brother.</i> This alludes to the <i>letters of
  fraternity</i>, which friars were accustomed to grant, under the
  conventual seal, to such laymen as had given them benefactions or were
  likely to leave them money in their wills. The benefactors received in
  return a brotherly participation in such spiritual benefits as the friars
  could confer. Thus, in Jack Upland, §§ 28, 29, we find:&mdash;'Why be ye
  [friars] so hardie to grant, by letters of fraternitie, to men and women,
  that they shall haue part and merite of all your good deeds, and ye weten
  neuer whether God be apayed with your deeds because of your sin?... What
  betokeneth that yee haue ordeined that, whan such one as ye haue made
  your brother or sister, and hath a letter of your seale, that letter
  mought be brought in your holy chapter, and there be rad, <!-- Page 340
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>[340]</span>or els yee
  will not pray for him?' See Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 377, 420;
  ed. Matthew, p. 4. Such lay brethren were usually dressed for burial in a
  friar's habit; see Milton, P.&nbsp;L. iii. 479; Rock, Church of our Fathers,
  i. 487. A benefactor could even thus belong to <i>all</i> the orders of
  friars at once; cf. P. Plowman, C. x. 343 (B. vii. 192). This gives point
  to the question in l. 1955 above.</p>

  <p>2156. <i>His meynee</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the menials of the sick man.</p>

  <p>2159. His companion was in the nearest inn; see l. 1779.</p>

  <p>2162. <i>court</i>, the house of the lord of the manor. 'The larger
  country-houses consisted generally of an enclosed court, from which
  circumstance this name was usually given to the manorial residence, and
  it has been preserved to modern times, as a common term for gentlemen's
  seats.'&mdash;Wright. Cf. P. Plowman, C. xxiii. 344. It was also called a
  <i>place</i>; see note to B. 1910; p. 184.</p>

  <p>2164. 'Of ech sich privat seete, by licence of the pope, ben maad,
  some <i>chapeleyns of houshold</i>, summe chapeleyns of honour,' &amp;c.;
  Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 511. 'Frere, what charity is this, to be
  confessors of lords and ladies,' &amp;c.; Jack Upland, § 37. And see
  Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, p. 333; P. Plowman, B. v. 136-142, xx.
  341-345.</p>

  <p>2185. <i>maister.</i> The hypocrite here declines to be called
  'master,' though he had allowed the good wife to call him so twice
  without reproof; see ll. 1800, 1836; and cf. l. 1781. At the same time,
  he declares that he had gained the title of Master in the schools. As he
  was the prior or principal of his convent (see ll. 2260, 2265, 2276) he
  may have been 'capped,' or have received the degree of Master of
  Divinity. 'Also capped freris, that ben calde maystres of dyvynite, have
  her chaumber and servise as lordis or kynges.... And what cursidenesse in
  this ... to gete hym a cappe of maysterdome, by preyer of lordis and
  grete giftis,' &amp;c.; Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 376. An LL.D. of
  Edinburgh is 'capped,' or has a doctor's cap momentarily laid upon his
  head, when he receives his degree; as I know by experience.</p>

  <p>See also Pierce the Ploughman's Crede, ll. 498, 574.</p>

  <p>2187. See Matt. xxiii. 7, 8.</p>

  <p>2196. See Matt. v. 13.</p>

  <p>2205. 'How does it seem to me?' Read <i>think'th</i>.</p>

  <p>2209. 'I consider him to be in a kind of frenzy'; cf. 2240, 2292.</p>

  <p>2219. <i>Shewe</i> here means 'to propose' or 'propound.'</p>

  <p>2235. See Chaucer's own explanation of the method of propagation of a
  sound, in the Hous of Fame, 782-821. He seems to have taken it from
  Boethius, De Musica, i. 14; see vol. iii. p. 260.</p>

  <p>2238. <i>my cherl</i>, i.&nbsp;e. my serf; as being his dependant. It
  probably implies vassalage.</p>

  <p>2244. Cf. A. 100. Although the squire was not above winning 'a new
  gown,' he was probably a young man of (future) equal rank with the lord
  of the manor. In fact, his scornful boldness proves it. <!-- Page 341
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page341"></a>[341]</span></p>

  <p>2247. <i>goune-cloth.</i> 'In the middle ages, the most common
  rewards, and even those given by the feudal landholders to their
  dependants and retainers, were articles of apparel, especially the gown
  or outward robe.... Money was comparatively very scarce in the middle
  ages; and as the household retainers were lodged and fed, clothing was
  almost the only article they wanted.'&mdash;Wright.</p>

  <p>2259. 'The regular number of monks or friars in a convent had been
  fixed at twelve, with [i.&nbsp;e. besides] their superior; in imitation, it is
  said, of the number of twelve apostles and their divine master. The
  larger religious houses were considered as consisting of a certain number
  of convents. Thus Thorn, speaking of the abbot of St. Augustine's at
  Canterbury, says:&mdash;Anno Domini m.c.xlvi, iste Hugo reparavit
  antiquum numerum monachorum istius monasterii, et erant lx. monachi
  professi praeter abbatem, hoc est, <i>quinque</i> conuentus in
  universo.&mdash;<i>Decem Scriptores</i>, col. 1807.'&mdash;Wright. That
  is, this house consisted of sixty-one members, the abbot and five
  convents of twelve each. The smaller (single) convents were also called
  <i>cells</i>, and the principal, the <i>prior</i>; see A. 172, and note
  that, in A. 167, the Monk is said, not to be an abbot, but to be
  <i>fit</i> to be an abbot. The expression '<i>his</i> covent,' in l.
  2261, shews that the friar confessor was the prior or head of his
  cell.</p>

  <p>2279. 'Yif a frere be a <i>maister</i>, or a riche frere in-mong hise
  bretheren, he shal be loutid and worshipid more then Cristis lawe
  techith,' &amp;c.; Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, p. 306.</p>

  <p>2281. This implies that the squire, with the rest, had heard the friar
  preach in church that morning, and had been greatly bored by the
  sermon.</p>

  <p>2289. I supply the word <i>as</i>, which is plainly wanted. MS. Hl.
  supplies <i>elles</i>, but I believe <i>as</i> to be right. The way in
  which the second <i>as</i> came to be dropped in this line, is very
  curious. It arose from misunderstanding the spelling of Ptolemy.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of an unpronounceable <i>P</i> at the beginning of
  <i>Ptolomee</i> made the scribes think something must be <i>omitted</i>.
  Hence several of them introduced a stroke through the <i>p</i>, which
  stood as an abbreviation for 'ro,' and this turned it into
  <i>Protholomee</i>, which looked right, but made the second <i>as</i>
  superfluous. Thus MSS. Cp. Hl. both have 'p<i>ro</i>tholome,' with the
  mark of abbreviation; in MSS. E. Hn. Dd. it is expanded into
  'Protholomee' at length. We again find the scribes in the same difficulty
  in D. 324. A still stranger spelling is <i>plotolomee</i>, for which see
  vol. iii. p. 359, l. 18. Cf. the note on Ptolemy in the same volume, at
  p. 354.</p>

  1360. He was not however a mere lawyer. Chaucer speaks of him as
  excelling in <i>philosophy</i>, and so does his epitaph in Panzirolus.
  The only specimen of his philosophy that I have met with is in MS. Harl.

  this is not here alluded to. What Chaucer means is the first section of

  <i>Saluces</i>, Saluzzo, S. of Turin. <i>Vesulus</i>, Monte Viso. See the
  description of the route from Mont Dauphin to Saluzzo, by the Col de
  Viso, in Murray's Guide to Switzerland and Piedmont. Cf. Vergil, Aen. x.
  708.</p>

  <p>51. <i>To Emelward</i>, towards Aemilia. Tyrwhitt says&mdash;'One of
  the regions of Italy was called Aemilia, from the <i>via Aemilia</i>,
  which crossed it from Placentia [Piacenza] to Rimini. Placentia stood
  upon the Po. Pitiscus, Lex. Ant. Rom. in v. <i>Via Aemilia</i>.
  Petrarch's description ... is a little different.' See note above.
  <i>Ferrare</i>, Ferrara, on the Po, not far from its mouth.
  <i>Venyse</i>, rather the Venetian territory than Venice itself.</p>

  <p>54. 'It seems to me a thing irrelevant, excepting that he wishes to
  impart his information.'</p>

  <p>56. <i>this</i>, contraction for <i>this is</i> (see footnote);
  common.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Clerkes Tale.</b></p>

  <p>57. In many places this story is translated from Petrarch almost word
  for word; and as Tyrwhitt remarks, it would be endless to cite
  illustrative passages from the original Latin; see further in vol. iii.
  p. 453. The first stanza is praised by Professor Lowell, in his Study
  Windows, p. 208, where he says&mdash;'What a sweep of vision is here!'
  Chaucer is not quite so close a translator here as usual; the passage in
  Petrarch being&mdash;'Inter caetera ad radicem Vesuli, terra Salutiarum,
  uicis et castellis satis frequens, Marchionum arbitrio nobilium quorundum
  regitur uirorum.'</p>

  <p>82. <i>leet he slyde</i>, he allowed to pass unattended to, neglected.
  So we find 'Let the world <i>slide</i>'; Induction to Taming of the
  Shrew, l. 5; and 'The state of vertue never <i>slides</i>'; The Sturdy
  Rock (in Percy's Reliques). See March's Student's Manual of Eng. Lang. p.
  125, where the expression is noted as still current in America. Petrarch
  has&mdash;'alia pene cuncta negligeret.' With ll. 83-140, cf. Shakesp.
  Sonnets, i-xvii. <!-- Page 344 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page344"></a>[344]</span></p>

  <p>86. <i>flockmele</i>, in a flock or troop; Pet. has 'cateruatim.'
  'Treuly theder came <i>flockemele</i> the multitude of tho blessyd
  sowlys':&mdash;Monk of Evesham, ed. Arber, c. 55; p. 107. Palsgrave's
  French Dict. has&mdash;'Flockmeale, <i>par troupeaux</i>'; fol. 440,
  back. Cf. E. <i>piece-meal</i>; we also find <i>wukemalum</i>, week by
  week, Ormulum, 536; <i>lim-mele</i>, limb from limb, Layamon, 25618;
  <i>hipyllmelum</i>, by heaps, Wycl. Bible, Wisdom xviii. 25: Koch, Eng.
  Gramm. ii. 292.</p>

  <p>99. 'Although I have no more to do with this matter than others have
  who are here present.' Observe that the Marquis is addressed as
  <i>ye</i>, not <i>thou</i>, the former being a title of respect.</p>

  <p>103-105. These three lines are not in the original.</p>

  <p>106. We should have expected to find here <i>us lyketh ye</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
  you are pleasing to us; but we really have an instance of a double
  dative, so that <i>us lyketh yow</i> is equivalent to 'it pleases us with
  respect to you.' The nominative case is <i>ye</i>, the dative and
  accusative <i>yow</i> or <i>you</i>. <i>Yow leste</i>, it may please you,
  in l. 111, is the usual idiom.</p>

  <p>107. <i>and ever han doon</i>, and (both you and your doings) have
  ever brought it about. Such is the usual force of <i>doon</i>; cf. ll.
  253, 1098.</p>

  <p>115. Cf. Barbour's Bruce, ed. Skeat, i. 266-8.&mdash;M.</p>

  <p>118-119. Expanded from&mdash;'uolant enim dies rapidi.'</p>

  <p>121. <i>still as stoon</i>; Latin text, 'tacita.' Cf. F. 171.</p>

  <p>129. <i>we wol chese yow</i>, we will choose for you.</p>

  <p>147. <i>Ther</i>, where. This line is Chaucer's own.</p>

  <p>157. <i>Bountee</i>, goodness. <i>streen</i>, race, stock. Petrarch
  has&mdash;'Quicquid in homine boni est, non ab alio quam a Deo est.'</p>

  <p>168. <i>As</i>, as if. This line, in Petrarch, comes after l. 173.
  Lines 174, 175 are Chaucer's own.</p>

  <p>172. <i>as ever</i>, &amp;c., as ever I may thrive, as I hope to
  thrive.</p>

  <p>190-196. Expanded from&mdash;'Et ipse nihilominus eam ipsam nuptiarum
  curam domesticis suis imposuit, edixitque diem.'</p>

  <p>197-203. Expanded from&mdash;'Fuit haud procul a palatio uillula
  paucorum atque inopum incolarum.'</p>

  <p>211-217. Sometimes Chaucer translates literally, and sometimes he
  merely paraphrases, as here. Lines 215-217 are all his own.</p>

  <p>220. <i>rype and sad corage</i>, a mature and staid disposition.
  Petrarch has&mdash;'sed uirilis senilisque animus uirgineo latebat in
  pectore.'</p>

  <p>223. <i>spinning</i>; i.&nbsp;e. she spun whilst keeping the sheep; see a
  picture of St. Geneviève in Mrs. Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art. Line
  224 is Chaucer's.</p>

  <p>227. <i>shredde and seeth</i>, sliced and sod (or boiled). Lat. 'domum
  rediens oluscula et dapes fortunae congruas praeparabat, durumque
  cubiculum sternebat,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>229. <i>on lofte</i>, aloft. She kept up her father's life, i.&nbsp;e.
  sustained him. His death is recorded in l. 1134.</p>

  <p>234. For this line the Latin has only the word <i>transiens</i>.</p>

  <p>237. <i>in sad wyse</i>, soberly; Lat. 'senili grauitate.' <!-- Page
  345 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>[345]</span></p>

  <p>242. Here <i>the people</i> means the common people; Lat.
  '<i>uulgi</i> oculis.' In the next line <i>he</i> is <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'empathic'.">emphatic</span>,
  meaning that <i>his</i> eyes were quicker to perceive than
  <i>theirs</i>.</p>

  <p>253. <i>hath don make</i>, hath caused to be made. Lat. 'Ipse interim
  et anulos aureos et coronas et balteos conquirebat.' Chaucer inserts
  <i>asure</i>, the colour of fidelity; see F. 644, and note. For
  <i>balteos</i> he substitutes the English phrase <i>broches and
  ringes</i>; cf. P. Plowm. B. prol. 75.</p>

  <p>257. Scan&mdash;Bý | a maýd | e lýk | to hír | statúrë. ||</p>

  <p>259. Here Chaucer apparently omits a sentence, namely:&mdash;'Uenerat
  expectatus dies, et cum nullus sponsae rumor audiretur, admiratio omnium
  uehementer excreuerat.' But he has, in fact, given us this above, in ll.
  246-8.</p>

  <p>260. <i>undern</i> (lit. the intervening or middle period) has two
  meanings in the Teutonic tongues; (1) mid-forenoon, i.&nbsp;e. originally 9
  <span class="sm">A. M.</span>; and (2) mid-afternoon, originally 3 <span
  class="sm">P. M.</span> In this passage it is clearly the former that is
  meant; indeed in l. 981, where it occurs again, the original has
  'proximae lucis <i>hora tertia</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. 9 <span class="sm">A.
  M.</span> In <i>this</i> passage, the original has <i>hora prandii</i>,
  meaning luncheon-time, which in Chaucer's time would often be 9 <span
  class="sm">A. M.</span>; see note to B. 1396, at p. 171; and cf. Ælfric's
  Homilies, ed. Thorpe, ii. 77. See note to Piers Pl. B. vi. 147; and see
  <i>Undern</i> in the Glossary.</p>

  <p>But it may be noted here, that the sense of <i>undern</i> is variable.
  Sometimes it meant the period from 9 to 12, or the middle of that period,
  i.&nbsp;e. about 10.30 or 11. Sometimes, the period from 3 to 6 <span
  class="sm">P. M.</span>, or the middle of it, i.&nbsp;e. about 4.30 or 4. In
  modern E. dialects, it means about 4 <span class="sm">P. M.</span> See B.
  4412, D. 875.</p>

  <p>260-294. Expanded and improved from the following short passage: 'Hora
  iam prandii aderat, iamque apparatu ingenti domus tota feruebat. Tum
  Gualtherus, aduentanti ueluti sponsae obuiam profecturus, domo egreditur,
  prosequente uirorum et matronarum nobilium caterua. Griseldis omnium quae
  erga se pararentur ignara, peractis quae agenda domi erant, aquam e
  longinquo fonte conuectans paternum limen intrabat: ut, expedita curis
  aliis, ad uisendam domini sui sponsam cum puellis comitibus
  properaret.'</p>

  <p>322. <i>governeth</i>, arrange, dispose of. Observe the use of the
  <i>plural</i> imperative, as a mark of respect. When the marquis
  addresses Griseldis as <i>ye</i>, it is a mark of extreme condescension
  on his part; the Latin text has <i>tu</i> and <i>te</i>.</p>

  <p>337-343. Expanded from&mdash;'insolito tanti hospitis aduentu stupidam
  inuenere; quam iis uerbis Gualtherus aggreditur.'</p>

  <p>350. <i>yow avyse</i>, consider the matter; really a delicate way of
  expressing refusal. Compare the legal formula <i>le roy s'avisera</i> for
  expressing the royal refusal to a proposed measure.</p>

  <p>364. <i>For to be deed</i>, even if I were to be dead, were to die;
  Lat. 'et si me mori iusseris, quod moleste feram.'</p>

  <p>375-376. These characteristic lines are Chaucer's own. So are ll. 382,
  383. <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page346"></a>[346]</span></p>

  <p>381. <i>corone</i>, nuptial garland; Lat. 'corona.' See Brand's Pop.
  Antiq. ed. Ellis, ii. 123.</p>

  <p>388. <i>snow-whyt</i>; Lat. 'niueo.' Perhaps Spenser took a hint from
  this; F. Q. i. 1. 4. In the Leg. of Good Women, l. 1198, Chaucer calls a
  horse <i>paper-whyt</i>.</p>

  <p>393. Repeated, slightly altered, from l. 341.</p>

  <p>409. <i>thewes</i>, mental qualities. So also in E. 1542; Gower, Conf.
  Amant. lib. vii. sect. 1 (ed. Pauli, iii. 85); Spenser, F.&nbsp;Q. i. 9. 3; i.
  10. 4; ii. 1. 33, &amp;c. 'The common signification of the word
  <i>thews</i> in our old writers, is manners, or qualities of mind and
  disposition.... By <i>thews</i> Shakespeare means unquestionably brawn,
  nerves, muscular vigour (Jul. Caes. i. 3; 2 Hen. IV, iii. 2; Hamlet, i.
  3). And to this sense, and this only, the word has now settled down; the
  other sense, which was formerly so familiar in our literature, is quite
  gone out and forgotten. [With respect to <i>theawe</i> = sinew, in
  Layamon, l. 6361] Sir F. Madden remarks (iii. 471):&mdash;"This is the
  only instance in the poem of the word being applied to bodily qualities,
  nor has any other passage of an earlier date than the sixteenth century
  been found in which it is so used." It may be conjectured that it had
  only been a provincial word in this sense, till Shakespeare adopted it';
  Craik's English of Shakespeare; note on Jul. Caesar, i. 3. 81.</p>

  <p>412. <i>embrace</i>, hold fast; 'omnium animos nexu sibi magni amoris
  <i>astrinxerat</i>.' Compare Tennyson's Lord of Burleigh with ll.
  394-413.</p>

  <p>413. Nearly identical with Troil. i. 1078.</p>

  <p>421. <i>royally</i>; alluding to the royal virtues of Griseldis.</p>

  <p>429. Not only the context, but the Latin text, justifies the reading
  <i>homlinesse</i>. <i>Feet</i> is fact, i.&nbsp;e. act. The Latin
  is&mdash;'Neque uero solers sponsa muliebria tantum haec
  <i>domestica</i>, sed, ubi res posceret, publica etiam obibat officia.'
  Lines 432-434 are Chaucer's own.</p>

  <p>444. 'Although it would have been liefer to her to have borne a male
  child'; i.&nbsp;e. she would rather, &amp;c. The Latin has&mdash;'quamuis
  filium maluisset.'</p>

  <p>449-462. Expanded from&mdash;'Cepit (ut fit) interim Gualtherum, cum
  iam ablactata esset infantula (mirabilis quaedam quàm laudabilis,
  [<i>aliter</i>, an mirabile quidem magis quam laudabile,] doctiores
  iudicent) cupiditas satis expertam charae fidem coniugis experiendi
  altius [<i>aliter</i>, ulterius], et iterum atque iterum retentandi.'</p>

  <p>452. <i>tempte</i>, make trial of, prove; see ll. 1152, 1153 below.
  <i>sadnesse</i>, constancy, equanimity.</p>

  <p>483. Note Walter's use of the word <i>thee</i> here, and of <i>thy</i>
  twice in the next stanza, instead of the usual <i>ye</i>. It is a slight,
  but significant sign of insult, offered under pretence of reporting the
  opinion of others. In l. 492 we have <i>your</i> again.</p>

  <p>504. <i>thing</i>, possession. Lat. 'de rebus tuis igitur fac ut
  libet.'</p>

  <p>516. <i>a furlong wey or two</i>, the distance of one or two furlongs,
  a short distance, a little. The line simply means&mdash;'a little after.'
  <!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page347"></a>[347]</span></p>

  <p>525. <i>stalked him</i>; marched himself in, as we should say. This
  use of <i>him</i> is remarkable, but not uncommon.</p>

  <p>533-539. Lat. 'Iussus sum hanc infantulam accipere, atque
  eam&mdash;Hîc sermone abrupto, quasi crudele ministerium silentio
  exprimens, subticuit.' Compare 'Quos ego&mdash;'; Vergil, Aen. i.
  135.</p>

  <p>540-546. Lat. 'Suspecta uiri fama; suspecta facies; suspecta hora;
  suspecta erat oratio; quibus etsi clare occisum iri dulcem filiam
  intelligeret, nec lachrymulam tamen ullam, nec suspirium dedit.' Mr.
  Wright quotes this otherwise, putting <i>dulce</i> for <i>dulcem</i>, and
  stopping at <i>intelligeret</i>.</p>

  <p>547-567. Chaucer expands the Latin, and transposes some of the matter.
  Lines 561-563 precede ll. 547-560 in the original, which merely
  has&mdash;'in nutrice quidem, nedum in matre durissimum; sed tranquilla
  fronte puellulam accipiens aliquantulum respexit &amp; simul exosculans
  benedixit, ac signum sanctae crucis impressit, porrexitque
  satelliti.'</p>

  <p>570. After <i>That</i> in this line, we ought, in strict grammar, to
  have <i>ye burie</i> in the next line, instead of the imperative
  <i>burieth</i>. But the phrase is idiomatic, and as all the seven best
  MSS. agree in this reading, it is best to retain it. Tyrwhitt alters
  <i>That but</i> to <i>But if</i>.</p>

  <p>579. <i>Somwhat</i>, in some degree. But Petrarch says
  differently&mdash;'<i>uehementer</i> paterna animum pietas mouit.'</p>

  <p>582-591. Lat. 'Iussit satelliti obuolutam pannis, cistae iniectam, ac
  iumento impositam, quiete omni quanta posset diligentia Bononiam deferret
  ad sororem suam, quae illic comiti de Panico nupta erat,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>586. 'But, under penalty of having his head cut off'; lit. of cutting
  off his head.</p>

  <p>589. <i>Boloigne</i>, Bologna, E. by S. from Modena, and a long way
  from Saluzzo. <i>Panik</i> answers to the <i>de Panico</i> in note to l.
  582; Boccaccio has <i>Panago</i>. I observe in the map the river
  <i>Panaro</i> flowing between Modena and Bologna; perhaps there is some
  connexion between the names. Tyrwhitt has <i>Pavie</i> (Pavia) in his
  text, but corrects it in the notes.</p>

  <p>602. <i>in oon</i>, in one and the same state: <i>ever in oon</i>,
  always alike, continually; so also in l. 677. Cf. Kn. Ta. 913 (A.
  1771).</p>

  <p>607. This must mean&mdash;'no accidental sign of any calamity.'</p>

  <p>612. <i>A knave child</i>, a male child, boy; as in Barbour's Bruce,
  xiii. 693; English Gilds, ed. T. Smith, p. 30.</p>

  <p>615. <i>merië</i>; three syllables; cf. A. 1386, B. 4156. Ll. 621-623
  are Chaucer's own.</p>

  <p>625. <i>sikly berth</i>, hardly bear, dislike. Lat. 'populum <i>aegre
  ferre</i>,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>643. Lat. 'ne te inopinus et subitus dolor turbet.'</p>

  <p>645-651. Expanded from&mdash;'Dixi (ait) et repeto, nihil possum seu
  uelle, seu nolle, nisi quae tu; neque uero in ijs filiis quicquam habeo,
  praeter laborem.'</p>

  <p>663. <i>plesancë</i>, three syllables; <i>stabl'</i>, one
  syllable.</p>

  <p>666. 'The pain of death is not to be compared to the pleasure of your
  <!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page348"></a>[348]</span>love.' Lat. 'nec mors ipsa nostro fuerit
  par amori.' Cf. ll. 817, 1091.</p>

  <p>687. <i>ever lenger</i>, &amp;c., i.&nbsp;e. ever the longer (he thinks of
  it) the more he wonders. In <i>the more</i>, the word <i>the</i> is for
  A.&nbsp;S. <i>þý</i>.</p>

  <p>700. <i>And he</i>; cf. <i>And ye</i>, l. 105.</p>

  <p>701-707. Expanded from&mdash;'sed sunt qui, ubi semel inceperint, non
  desinant; immo incumbant, haereantque proposito.'</p>

  <p>704. <i>a stake</i>; cf. Macb. v. 7. 1; Jul. Caesar, iv. 1. 48.</p>

  <p>714. <i>more penible</i>, more painstaking; Lat. 'obsequentior.'</p>

  <p>719. 'She made it clear that no wife should of herself, on account of
  any worldly anxiety, have any will, in practice, different from that of
  her husband.'</p>

  <p>722. <i>sclaundre</i>, ill fame, ill report concerning Walter. See l.
  730.</p>

  <p>738. <i>message</i>, a messenger; Lat. '<i>nuncios</i> Romam misit.'
  So in Old English we find <i>prisoun</i> or <i>prison</i> for prisoner;
  Piers Pl. B. vii. 30.</p>

  <p>772. <i>anon</i>, immediately. It was not uncommon in olden times for
  girls to be married at twelve years of age. The Wife of Bath was first
  married at that age; see D. 4.</p>

  <p>797. Lat. 'magna omnis fortuna seruitus magna est; non mihi licet,
  quod cuilibet liceret agricolae.'</p>

  <p>850. <i>were</i> agrees with the word <i>clothes</i> following; cf.
  <i>it ben</i>, Piers Plowm. B. vi. 56. She did not really bring her
  husband even the dower of her old clothes, as they had been taken from
  her. Lines 851-861 are all Chaucer's own, and shew his delicacy of
  touch.</p>

  <p>866. Lat. 'neque omnino alia mihi dos fuit, quam fides et
  nuditas.'</p>

  <p>871. Probably suggested by Job, i. 21. So l. 902 is from Job, iii.
  3.</p>

  <p>880-882. These lines are Chaucer's own; l. 880 is characteristic of
  him. The phrase in l. 880 seems to have been proverbial. Cf. 'I walke as
  werme, withoute wede'; Coventry Mysteries, p. 28. But Chaucer got it from
  Le Roman de la Rose, 445; see his translation, l. 454; vol. i. p.
  112.</p>

  <p>888-889. The latter part of l. 888, and l. 889, are Chaucer's own.</p>

  <p>903. <i>lyves</i>, alive; <i>a lyves creature</i>, a creature alive, a
  living being. <i>Lyves</i> is an adverb, formed like <i>nedes</i>, from
  the genitive case of the substantive. There are other instances of its
  use.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Yif I late him <i>liues</i> go'; Havelok, 509.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. if I let him go away <i>alive</i>. And again <i>lyues</i> =
  alive, in Piers Pl. B. xix. 154. Nearly repeated from Troil. iv.
  251-2.</p>

  <p>910. After this line, Chaucer has omitted the circumstance of
  Janicola's preserving his daughter's old clothing; 'tunicam eius
  hispidam, et attritam senio, abditam paruae domus in parte seruauerat.'
  See l. 913.</p>

  <p>911. <i>Agayns</i>, towards, so as to meet. <i>To go agayns</i>, in M.
  E., is <i>to go to meet</i>. So also <i>to come agayns</i>, <i>to ride
  agayns</i> (or <i>agayn</i>). See <i>Agayn</i> in Glossary to Spec. of
  Eng. (Morris and Skeat); and Barbour's Bruce, xiv. 420. Ll. 915-917 are
  Chaucer's own. <!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page349"></a>[349]</span></p>

  <p>916. 'For the cloth was poor, and many days older now than on the day
  of her marriage.'</p>

  <p>932. 'Men speak of Job, and particularly of his humility.' Cf. Job,
  xl. 4, xlii. 1-6.</p>

  <p>934. <i>Namely of men</i>, especially of <i>men</i>, where <i>men</i>
  is emphatic. The whole of this stanza (932-938) is Chaucer's.</p>

  <p>938. <i>but</i>, except, unless; <i>falle</i>, fallen, happened;
  <i>of-newe</i>, newly, an adverbial expression. It means then, 'unless it
  has happened very lately.' In other words, 'If there is an example of a
  man surpassing a woman in humility, it must have happened very lately;
  for I have never heard of it.'</p>

  <p>939. <i>Pars Sexta.</i> This indication of a new part comes in a
  fitting place, and is taken from Tyrwhitt, who may have found it in a MS.
  But there is no break here in the Latin original, nor in any of the MSS.
  of Chaucer which I have consulted. <i>erl of Panik</i>; Lat. 'Panicius
  comes.'</p>

  <p>940. <i>more and lesse</i>, greater or smaller; i.&nbsp;e. everybody. So
  also in the Frank. Tale, 'riveres <i>more and lesse</i>'; F. 1054. So
  also <i>moche and lyte</i>, great and small, Prol. 494; <i>moste and
  leste</i>, greatest and least, A. 2198. Spenser has, F.&nbsp;Q. vi. 6.
  12,&mdash;</p>

  Morris's Eng. Accidence, sect. 218, p. 142.</p>

  <p>960. <i>wommen</i>; some MSS. have <i>womman</i>, as in Tyrwhitt. But
  MS. E. is right. Petrarch uses the word <i>foeminas</i>, not
  <i>foeminam</i>.</p>

  <p>965. <i>yvel biseye</i>, ill provided; lit. ill beseen. The word
  <i>yvel</i> is pronounced here almost as a monosyllable (as it were
  <i>yv'l</i>), as is so commonly the case with <i>ever</i>; indeed
  generally, words ending with <i>el</i> and <i>er</i> are often thus
  clipped. A remarkable instance occurs in the Milleres Tale (A. 3715),
  where we not only have a similar ending, but the word <i>ever</i> in the
  same line&mdash;</p>

  <p>See also <i>yvel apayed</i> in line 1052 below. The converse to
  <i>yvel biseye</i>, is <i>richely biseye</i>, richly provided or adorned,
  in l. 984 below.</p>

  <p>981. Lat. 'Proximae lucis hora tertia comes superuenerat'; see note to
  l. 260.</p>

  <p>995-1008. These two stanzas are Chaucer's own, and are so good that
  they must have been a later addition; Prof. Ten Brink suggests the date
  1387 (Eng. Lit. ii. 123, Eng. version). In MS. E. the word <i>Auctor</i>
  is inserted in the margin, and l. 995 begins with a large capital letter.
  At the beginning of l. 1009 is a paragraph-mark, shewing where the
  translation begins again. <i>unsad</i>, unsettled. Cf. Shakesp. Cor. i.
  1. 186, Jul. Caesar, i. 1. 55; Scott, Lady of the Lake, v. 30.</p>

  <p>999. 'Ever full of tittle-tattle, which would be dear enough at a
  halfpenny.' See n. to l. 1200. <i>Iane</i>, a small coin of Genoa
  (Janua); see Rime of Sir Thopas, B. 1925. The first stanza (995-1001) is
  supposed <!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page350"></a>[350]</span>to be uttered by the sober and discreet
  part of the population; see l. 1002.</p>

  <p>1031. <i>lyketh thee</i>, pleases thee. The marquis addresses her as
  <i>thou</i>, because all suppose her to be a menial.</p>

  <p>1039. <i>mo</i>, lit. more; but also used in the sense of
  <i>others</i>, or, as here, <i>another</i>. The modern phrase would be,
  'as you did <i>somebody else</i>.' The extreme delicacy of the hint is
  admirable. This use of <i>mo</i> is common in Chaucer; see the Glossary.
  So also, in Specimens of English, ed. Morris and Skeat, we have, at p.
  47, l. 51&mdash;</p>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. I sigh for unrest, and mourn as <i>other</i> men do. And on the

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. 'The moody moan as <i>others</i> do; I wot I am one of them.' In
  l. 240 of How the Good Wife taught her Daughter, pr. with Barbour's
  Bruce, ed. Skeat, we find&mdash;'And slanderit folk vald euir haue
  <i>ma</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. would ever have <i>others like themselves</i>. Somewhat
  similar is the expression <i>oþer mo</i>, where we should now say
  <i>others as well</i>; Piers Plowman, C. v. 10, xxii. 54. A somewhat
  similar use of <i>mo</i> occurs in Tudor English. 'It fortuned Diogenes
  to ... make one among the <i>moo</i> at a dyner.'&mdash;Udall, tr. of
  Erasmus' Apophthegmes (1564), bk. i. § 91. So also:&mdash;'that he also,
  emong the <i>mo</i> [i.&nbsp;e. the rest] might haue his pleasure'; id. bk.
  ii. § 13. Tyrwhitt's suggestion that Chaucer has licentiously turned
  <i>me</i> into <i>mo</i> for the mere sake of getting a rime, in which he
  has hitherto been followed by nearly every editor, is only to be
  repudiated. It may well have been with the very purpose of guarding
  against this error that, in the Ellesmere and Hengwrt MSS., the original
  Latin text is here quoted in the margin&mdash;'unum bona fide te precor
  ac moneo: ne hanc illis aculeis agites, quibus <i>alteram</i> agitasti.'
  Chaucer, who throughout surpasses his original in delicacy of treatment,
  did not permit himself to be outdone here; and Boccaccio also has the
  word <i>altra</i>. The use of <i>me</i> would have been a <i>direct</i>
  charge of unkindness, spoiling the whole story. See l. 1045 and l.
  449.</p>

  <p>1049. <i>gan his herte dresse</i>, addressed his heart, i.&nbsp;e. prepared
  it, schooled it. The M. E. <i>dresse</i> is our modern <i>direct</i>;
  both being from Lat. <i>dirigere</i>.</p>

  <p>1053. Here we may once more note the use of the word <i>thy</i>, the
  more so as it is used with a quite different tone. We sometimes find it
  used, as here, <i>between equals</i>, as a term of <i>endearment</i>; it
  is, accordingly, very significant. See l. 1056.</p>

  <p>1066. <i>that other</i>, the other, the boy.</p>

  <p>1071. <i>non</i>, any, either. The use of it is due to the preceding
  <i>nat</i>.</p>

  <p>1079. Professor Morley, in his English Writers, v. 342, aptly remarks
  here&mdash;'And when Chaucer has told all, and dwelt with an <!-- Page
  351 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page351"></a>[351]</span>exquisite
  pathos of natural emotion all his own upon the patient mother's piteous
  and tender kissing of her recovered children&mdash;for there is nothing
  in Boccaccio, and but half a sentence in Petrarch, answering to these
  four beautiful stanzas (1079-1106)&mdash;he rounds all, as Petrarch had
  done, with simple sense, which gives religious meaning to the tale, then
  closes with a lighter strain of satire which protects Griselda herself
  from the mocker.'</p>

  <p>1098. 'Hath caused you (to be) kept.' For the same idiom, see Kn.
  Tale, A. 1913; Man of Law's Tale, B. 171, and the note. Cf. 'Wher I have
  beforn ordeyned and <i>do mad</i> [caused to be made] my tombe.' Royal
  Wills, ed. Nichols, p. 278.</p>

  <p>1133. <i>His wyves fader</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Janicola. This circumstance should
  have been mentioned <i>before</i> l. 1128, as in the original.</p>

  <p>1140. For <i>of</i> (Ellesmere MS.) the other MSS. read <i>in</i>.</p>

  <p>1141. <i>auctour</i>, author, i.&nbsp;e. Petrarch, whom Chaucer follows
  down to l. 1162. Ll. 1138-1141 are Chaucer's own, and may be compared
  with his poem on the Golden Age (vol. i. 380).</p>

  <p>1144. <i>importable</i>, intolerable; Lat.&mdash;'huius uxoris
  patientiam, quae mihi <i>uix imitabilis</i> uidetur.' Of course ll.
  1147-8 are Chaucer's.</p>

  <p>1151. 'Receive all with submission.' Fr. <i>en gré</i>, gratefully, in
  good part. <i>sent</i>, sendeth; present tense, as in Piers Plowman, C.
  xxii. 434. The past tense is <i>sente</i>, which would not rime.</p>

  <p>1152. 'For it is very reasonable that He should prove (or test) that
  which He created.'</p>

  <p>1153. <i>boghte</i>, (hath) redeemed. See St. James, i. 13.</p>

  <p>1162. Here Petrarch ends his narrative, and here, beyond all doubt,
  Chaucer's translation originally ended also. From this point to the end
  is the work of a later period, and in his best manner, though <i>unsuited
  to the coy Clerk</i>. He easily links on his addition by the simple
  expression <i>lordinges, herkneth</i>; and in l. 1170, he alludes to the
  <i>Wife of Bath</i>, of whom probably he had never thought when first
  translating the story.</p>

  <p>We can thus understand the stanza in the footnote, on p. 424. It is
  genuine, but was rejected at the time of adding ll. 1163-1212. It was
  afterwards expanded into The Monkes Prologue, with the substitution of
  the patient Prudence for the patient Griselda; see B. 3083-6.</p>

  <p>1177. Here the metre changes; the stanzas are of six lines; and all
  six stanzas are linked together. There are but three rimes throughout;
  <i><span class="nw">-ence</span></i> in the first and third lines of
  every stanza, <i><span class="nw">-aille</span></i> in the second,
  fourth, and sixth, (requiring <i>eighteen</i> rimes in all), and <i><span
  class="nw">-inde</span></i> in the fifth line. It is a fine example even
  from a metrical point of view alone.</p>

  <p>1188. <i>Chichevache</i>, for <i>chiche vache</i>, i.&nbsp;e. lean cow. The
  allusion is to an old fable, of French origin, which describes a
  monstrous cow named <i>Chiche Vache</i> as feeding entirely upon patient
  wives, and being very lean in consequence of the scarcity of her diet. A
  later form of the fable adds a second beast, named <i>Bicorne</i>
  (two-horned), who, by adopting the wiser course of feeding upon patient
  husbands, was <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page352"></a>[352]</span>always fat and in good case. Mr. Wright
  says&mdash;'M. Achille Jubinal, in the notes to his <i>Mystères inédits
  du xv Siècle</i>, tom. i. p. 390, has printed a French poetical
  description of <i>Chichevache</i> from a MS. of the fourteenth century.
  In the French miracle of St. Geneviève, of the fifteenth century
  (Jubinal, ib. p. 281), a man says satirically to the saint,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gardez vous de la <i>chicheface</i>,</p>
      <p>El vous mordra s'el vous encontre,</p>
      <p>Vous n'amendez point sa besoigne."'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A poem by Lydgate on <i>Bycorne and Chichevache</i> is printed in Mr.
  Halliwell's Minor Poems of Dan John Lydgate, p. 129 (Percy Society); see
  Morley's English Writers, vi. 107, and his Shorter English Poems, p. 55.
  In his Étude sur G. Chaucer, p. 221, M. Sandras refers us, for
  information about <i>Chicheface</i>, lit. 'thin face' or 'ugly face' (of
  which <i>Chiche vache</i> was a perversion), to the Histoire Littéraire
  de France, vol. xxiii. Dr. Murray refers us to Montaiglon, <i>Poésie
  franç. 15<sup>e</sup> et 16<sup>e</sup> siècles</i> (1855), ii. 191. The
  passage in Chaucer means, 'Beware of being too patient, lest Chichevache
  swallow you down.'</p>

  <p>1189. <i>Folweth Ekko</i>, imitate Echo, who <i>always
  replies</i>.</p>

  <p>1196. The forms <i>chamail</i>, <i>kamail</i>, a camel, occur in the
  A. F. Romance of King Horn, ed. Brede and Stengel, l. 4177. For the M.&nbsp;E.
  <i>camayl</i>, see Rich. Cuer de Lion, 2323; Cursor Mundi, 3304 (Trin.
  MS.).</p>

  <p>1200. 'Always talk (or rattle) on, like a mill' (that is always going
  round and making a noise). 'Janglinge is whan men speken to muche biforn
  folk, and <i>clappen as a mille</i>, and taken no kepe what they seye';
  Ch. Persones Tale, De Superbia (I. 406). Palsgrave's French Dict.
  has&mdash;'I clappe, I make a noyse as the clapper of a mill, <i>Ie
  clacque</i>.'</p>

  <p>Cf. 'As fast as millwheels strike'; Tempest, i. 2. 281.</p>

  <p>1204. <i>aventaille</i>, the lower half of the moveable part of a
  helmet which admitted air; called by Spenser the <i>ventail</i>, F.&nbsp;Q.
  iv. 6. 19; v. 8. 12; and by Shakespeare the <i>beaver</i>, Hamlet, i. 2.
  230. It is explained, in Douce's Illustrations of Shakespeare, that the
  moveable part of the helmet in front was made in two parts, which turned
  on hinges at the sides of the head. The upper part is the <i>visor</i>,
  to admit of vision, the lower the <i>ventail</i>, to admit of breathing.
  Both parts could be removed from the face, but only by lifting them
  <i>upwards</i>, and throwing them <i>back</i>. If the <i>visor</i> alone
  were lifted, only the upper part of the face was exposed; but if the
  <i>ventail</i> were lifted, the visor also went with it, and the whole of
  the face was seen. Compare Fairfax's Tasso, vii. 7:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'But sweet Erminia comforted their fear,</p>
      <p>Her <i>ventail</i> up, her visage <i>open laid</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So also in Hamlet. With reference to the present passage, Mr. Jephson
  says that <i>and eek his aventaille</i> is a perfect example of bathos. I
  fail to see why; the weapon that pierced a <i>ventail</i> would pass into
  the <!-- Page 353 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page353"></a>[353]</span>head, and inflict a death-wound. The
  passage is playful, but not silly.</p>

  <p>1206. <i>couche</i>, cower. Hence the phrase&mdash;'to play
  couch-quail'; see Skelton, ed. Dyce, ii. 348.</p>

  <p>1211. 'As light as a leaf on a linden-tree' was an old proverb. See
  Piers Pl. B. i. 154.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Marchauntes Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>1213. <i>Weping and wayling</i>; an expression caught from l. 1212,
  and linking this Prologue to the foregoing Tale. Yet in fourteen MSS. the
  Merchant's Tale is separated from the Clerk's; Trial Forewords, by F. J.
  Furnivall (Chaucer Soc.), p. 28.</p>

  <p>1221-2. <i>What</i>, why. <i>at al</i>, in every respect; like Lat.
  <i>omnino</i>.</p>

  <p>1227. This theme is enlarged upon in Lenvoy de Chaucer à Bukton, a
  late minor poem (vol. i. 398).</p>

  <p>1230. <i>Seint Thomas.</i> Whenever this Apostle is mentioned, he is
  nearly always said to be <i>of India</i>, to distinguish him, it may be,
  from Saint Thomas of Canterbury. See D. 1980, and the note. Some account
  of the shrine of St. Thomas, of the manner of his death, and of miracles
  wrought by him, is given in Marco Polo, bk. iii. ch. 18. Colonel Yule
  tells us that the body of St. Thomas lay at Mailapúr, a suburb of Madras.
  The legend of St. Thomas's preaching in India is of very high antiquity.
  St. Jerome speaks of the Divine Word being everywhere present in His
  fulness 'cum Thomâ in India, cum Petro Romae,' &amp;c.; Sci. Hieronomi
  Epist. lix., ad Marcellam. Gregory of Tours (<span class="sm">A.
  D.</span> 544-595) speaks of the place <i>in India</i> where the body of
  St. Thomas lay before it was transported to Edessa in the year 394. See
  the whole of Colonel Yule's long note upon the subject; and the account
  of Saint Thomas in Mrs. Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Marchantes Tale.</b></p>

  <p>For remarks on the sources of this Tale, see vol. iii. p. 458. The
  modern version by Pope may be compared, though it was a juvenile
  performance. Cf. Lydgate, Minor Poems, p. 28.</p>

  <p>This Tale frequently adopts passages from the Tale of Melibeus, which
  was doubtless written several years before it. See also the article by
  Dr. Köppel in Archiv für das Studium der neueren Sprachen, vol. 86, p.
  39.</p>

  <p>1246. <i>Pavye</i>, Pavia. I suppose that Chaucer had no special
  reason for locating the tale in Lombardy.</p>

  <p>1248-52. For <i>sixty</i>, some MSS. have <i>lx.</i>; the scribes of
  MSS. Hl. and Ln. wrongly have <i>fourty</i>, which looks as if they took
  <i>lx.</i> to mean <i>xl.</i> I see no point in turning the former
  <i>sixty</i> (in 1248) into <i>fourty</i>, as Wright does, on the
  pretence that the first twenty years of his life did not count. Sixty was
  considered a great age (l. 1401). <!-- Page 354 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>[354]</span></p>

  <p>1251. <i>seculeer</i>, secular; as distinguished from the monks and
  friars. Chaucer probably speaks ironically, meaning that these holy
  orders were as bad as the rest. See l. 1322.</p>

  <p>1267-1392. The whole of this passage presents the arguments that
  prevailed with January; as shewn by the words <i>For which</i> (i.&nbsp;e.
  wherefore) in l. 1393. That is to say, Chaucer here purposely keeps
  reasons <i>against</i> marriage out of sight, reserving them for ll.
  1521-1565, 1659-1681. Hence the opinion in l. 1269, that a man should
  marry when old, is not Chaucer's opinion at all.</p>

  <p>1270. 'The fruit of his treasure,' i.&nbsp;e. purchased with his own
  wealth. A queer reason, and not Chaucer's. Cf. l. 1276.</p>

  <p>1277. <i>sit wel</i>, is very fit. Palsgrave has: 'It sytteth, it
  becometh, <i>il siet</i>.'</p>

  <p>1284. For <i>blisful</i>, MS. Hl. wrongly has <i>busily</i>.</p>

  <p>1294. <i>Theofraste</i>, Theophrastus. The allusion is to the Liber
  Aureolus Theophrasti de Nuptiis, partly preserved by St. Jerome, who
  quotes a long extract from it in his tractate Contra Iovinianum, lib. i.
  John of Salisbury quotes the same passage, almost word for word, in his
  Polycraticus, lib. viii. c. 11. The point discussed is:&mdash;'an uir
  sapiens ducat uxorem.' Amongst other things, he has a passage answering
  to ll. 1296-1304 below. 'Quod si propter dispensationem domus ...
  ducuntur uxores: multo melius seruus fidelis dispensat, obediens
  auctoritati domini, et dispensationi eius obtemperans quàm uxor....
  Assidere autem aegrotanti magis possunt amici et uernulae beneficiis
  obligati, quàm illa quae nobis imputat lachrymas suas, et haereditatis
  spe uendit illuuiem.' Cf. Lounsbury, Studies, ii. 366.</p>

  <p>1305-6. These two lines occur in E. Cm., and are doubtless correct.
  The MSS. vary considerably; see Six-Text, Pref. p. 70.</p>

  <p>So also MS. Harl. 1758, Laud 600 and 739, Lichfield, &amp;c. The

  <p>So also (according to Tyrwhitt) the Haistwell MS. and MS. Royal 17. D.
  xv; and, according to Furnivall, MS. Chr. Ch. C. 6.</p>

  <p>In six MSS., according to Tyrwhitt, they are omitted; and on this
  account he omits them, on the plea that they 'form the opening of a new
  argument,... and consequently would have been cancelled, if he [Chaucer]
  had lived to publish his work.' But the sense is quite complete in the
  form in which I give them, from the two best MSS.</p>

  <p>1311. Against this line is written, in the margin of MS.
  E.&mdash;'Uxor est diligenda quia donum Dei est: Iesus filius Sirac:
  domus et diuicie dantur a parentibus, a Domino autem proprie uxor bona
  uel prudens.' But the reference is wrong; the quotation is not from
  Ecclesiasticus (or Jesus the son of Sirach), but from Prov. xix. 14. The
  Vulgate has <i>uxor prudens</i>, omitting <i>bona uel</i>. The
  <i>whole</i> quotation is from Albertano of Brescia's Liber de Amore Dei
  (Köppel).</p>

  <p>1315. Compare B. 1199, and I. 1068.</p>

  <p>1318. This parenthetical line is Chaucer's very own.</p>

  <p>1319. 'Sacramentum hoc magnum est'; Eph. v. 32. Marriage, in the
  Romish Church, is one of the seven sacraments.</p>

  <p>1323-35. All from Albertano of Brescia's Liber de Amore Dei
  (Köppel).</p>

  <p>1326. Hl. has <i>body-naked</i>; but all the rest (like the old
  editions) have <i>bely-naked</i>, which is the usual expression; see
  examples in Halliwell.</p>

  <p>1328. In the margin of E.&mdash;'Faciamus ei adiutorium,' &amp;c. From
  Gen. ii. 18, 24.</p>

  <p>1335-6. From Le Roman de la Rose, 16640-4.</p>

  <p>1337. <i>Seint-e</i> is feminine; <i>ben'cite</i> is trisyllabic.</p>

  <p>1358-61. Of course these lines are genuine; they occur in nearly every
  MS. but E. and Trin. Coll. R. 3. 3. The scribe of E. slipped from
  <i>reed</i> in 1357 to <i>rede</i> in 1362; a common mistake. Dr.
  Furnivall objects that <i>wyse</i> in 1359 is made to rime with
  <i>wyse</i> in 1360, and <i>rede</i> in 1361 with <i>rede</i> in 1362;
  the riming words being used <i>in the same sense</i>. This is not the
  case. The first <i>wyse</i> is plural; the second is singular, and used
  generally. The first <i>rede</i> means 'advise'; the second, 'read.' To
  leave them out would give a rime of <i>reed</i> (monosyllable) with
  <i>rede</i> (dissyllable).</p>

  <p>1362. The examples of Rebecca, Judith, Abigail, and Esther are quoted,
  in the same order and in similar terms, in the Tale of Melibeus; see B.

  <p>1373, 4. <i>Mardochee</i>, Mordecai; in the Vulgate, Mardochaeus.
  <i>Assuere</i>, Ahasuerus; in the Vulgate, Assuerus; see l. 1745.</p>

  <p>1376. In the margin of MS. Hn. is written:&mdash;'Seneca: sicut nichil
  est superius benigna coniuge, ita nichil est crudelius infesta muliere.'
  This is from Albertano of Brescia, Lib. Consolationis, cap. v. (p. 18).
  Sundby gives the reference, not to Seneca, but to Fulgentius,
  Mythologiarum, L. i. c. 27.</p>

  <p>Quoted, at second-hand, from Albertano (Köppel).</p>

  <p>1380. In the margin of MS. E.&mdash;'Bona mulier fidelis custos est,
  et bona domus.' From Albertano, as above.</p>

  <p>1381-2. 'Ubi non est mulier, ingemiscit <i>egens</i>'; Ecclus. xxxvi.
  27. Albertano quotes this, but alters <i>egens</i> to <i>eger</i>; hence
  Chaucer has 'the syke man'; see Köppel's article, p. 42.</p>

  <p>1384. See Eph. v. 25, 28, 29, 31.</p>

  <p>1385. <i>thou lovest</i>, thou wilt love; the present for the future;
  in the second instance. There is no real difficulty here, though Tyrwhitt
  makes one, and alters the text to <i>love thou</i>.</p>

  <p>1401. 'On the brink of my grave.' Cf. Ps. xxx. 3, 9; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1407-16. 'Uxorem accipias potius puellam quam uiduam'; from Albertano.

  <p>1418. 'I like fish when old, preferring a full grown pike to a
  pikerel; and I like flesh young, preferring veal to beef.'</p>

  <p>1424. <i>Wades boot</i>, Wade's boat. Wade was a famous hero of
  antiquity, to whom Chaucer again alludes in Troil. iii. 614. In the
  Traveller's Song, l. 22, we find:&mdash;'Witta w&#x113;old Sw&#x1E3;fum,
  Wada Hælsingum,' i.&nbsp;e. Witta ruled over the Swabians, Wada over the
  Hælsings.' Wade is again mentioned in the alliterative Morte Arthure, l.
  964. In a translation of Guido delle Colonne, in MS. Laud K. 76, in the
  Bodleian library, the romance of Wade is mentioned in conjunction with
  those of Havelok and Horn, both of which are well known; see the whole
  passage, as cited in Warton, Hist. E. Poetry, in a note to Section III.
  In Sir Beves of Hamtoun, ed. Kölbing, 2605, we have an allusion to his
  fight with a fire-drake or fiery dragon. And in Sir T. Malory's Morte
  Arthur, bk. vii. c. 9, we find:&mdash;'were thou as wyghte as euer was
  Wade or Launcelot.' Speght knew the story, but has not recorded it; his
  note is:&mdash;'Concerning Wade and his bote called Guingelot, as also
  his straunge exploits in the same, because the matter is long and
  fabulous, I pass it over.' On which Tyrwhitt remarks&mdash;'<i>Tantamne
  rem tam negligenter?</i> Mr. Speght probably did not foresee, that
  posterity would be as much obliged to him for a little of this
  <i>fabulous matter</i> concerning <i>Wade</i> and his <i>bote</i>, as for
  the gravest of his annotations.' Tyrwhitt also refers us, for a mention
  of Wade, to Camden's Britannia, 907, and to Charlton's History of Whitby,
  p. 40. M. Michel endeavoured to collect the particulars concerning Wade,
  and published them in a brochure, entitled <i>Wade: Lettre à M. Henri
  Ternaux-Compans, &amp;c. sur une Tradition Angloise du Moyen Age</i>;
  Paris, 1837; 8vo. But it does not tell us much more that is helpful,
  except in furnishing a reference to the Wilkina Saga, capp. 18-20.</p>

  <p>After all, the most light is given us by the following sentence in the
  <!-- Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page357"></a>[357]</span>Corpus Poeticum Boreale, ed. Vigfusson and
  Powell, i. 168, with reference to the Lay of Weyland. 'Weyland is trapped
  by Nidad, king of the Niars, hamstrung, and forced to work for him in his
  forge on the isle of Seastead in lake Wolfmere. He contrives to slay his
  tyrant's sons, beguile his daughter [named Bodwild], and by the aid of a
  pair of wings which he has fashioned to soar away from his prison-house,
  rejoicing in his revenge.... That the King's daughter had a son by
  Weyland, <i>the famous Wade</i> (the memory of whose magic boat
  <i>Wingelock</i> lingered in N. England till the Reformation), we know
  from Wilkina Saga.'</p>

  <p>I entirely differ from M. Michel's extraordinary conclusion about the
  boat&mdash;'Nous avons quelques raisons de croire que ce bateau n'étoit
  pas d'une course aussi rapide: en effet, dans l'Edda il est dit qu'Odin
  avoit un valet et une servante nommés <i>Ganglate</i> et
  <i>Gangl&oelig;t</i>, mots qu'on dit signifier <i>marchant
  lentement</i>.' Of course <i>Ganglati</i> and <i>Ganglöt</i> (as they
  should be written) mean 'slow-goer,' but this has nothing to do with
  <i>Guingelot</i>, which is merely a French spelling of some such form as
  <i>Wingelok</i>. It is obvious that the sole use of a magic boat is to
  transport its possessor from place to place in a few minutes, like the
  magic wings of Wade's own father. This is all we need to know, to see the
  point of the allusion. Old widows, says Chaucer in effect, know too much
  of the craft of Wade's boat; they can fly from place to place in a
  minute, and, if charged with any misdemeanour, will swear they were a
  mile away from the place at the time alleged. Mr. Pickwick, on the other
  hand, being only a man, failed to set up the plea of an <i>alibi</i>, and
  suffered accordingly.</p>

  <p>1425. <i>broken harm.</i> This is one of the phrases which Tyrwhitt
  includes in his list as being 'not understood'; nor is it easy. But if we
  take it in connexion with the context, I think it can be explained.
  <i>Harm</i> is 'mischief, injury'; broken is 'fragmentary,' as in 'broken
  meat,' and the like; so that <i>broken harm</i> refers to slight
  disconnected acts of mischief, or what we should now call 'petty
  annoyances,' or 'small worries.' Thus the sense is that 'widows know so
  much about ways of creating small annoyances, that I should never live in
  peace with one.' Taken all together, ll. 1424-6 simply imply that 'old
  widows are so full of tricks for deceiving me, and can inflict at
  pleasure such small but constant annoyances, that I,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1447. <i>Take him</i>, let him take; see the Exhortation in the
  Marriage-Service in the Book of Common Prayer; cf. Pers. Tale, I. 939,
  940, 861.</p>

  <p>1469. Cf. F. 202.</p>

  <p>1474. <i>disputisoun</i>, disputation. Many MSS. have
  <i>disputacioun</i>, which is too long. The form, as Tyrwhitt remarks, is
  quite correct; see B. 4428, F. 890. Spelt <i>desputeson</i> in Gower,
  Conf. Amant. i. 90. See <i>disputoison</i> in Godefroy, with the variants
  in <i><span class="nw">-aison</span></i>, <i><span
  class="nw">-eison</span></i>, <i><span class="nw">-eson</span></i>,
  <i><span class="nw">-ison</span></i>. Compare <i>orison</i> with
  <i>oration</i>.</p>

  <p>1476. <i>Placebo.</i> This name has reference to his complaisant
  disposition; see note to D. 2075. So, in the Ayenbite of Inwyt, ed. <!--
  Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page358"></a>[358]</span>Morris, p. 60, we have: 'The verthe zenne
  is, thet huanne hi alle zingeth Placebo, thet is to zigge: "mi lhord
  zayth zoth, my lhord doth wel"; and wendeth to guode al thet the guodeman
  deth other zayth, by hit guod, by hit kuead.'</p>

  <p>1485. This quotation is not from Solomon, but from Jesus son of
  Sirach; see Ecclus. xxxii. 19:&mdash;'Do nothing without advice, and when
  thou hast once done, repent not.' Chaucer follows the Vulgate version;
  see note to B. 2193, where the quotation recurs.</p>

  <p>1516. 'Your heart hangs on a jolly pin,' i.&nbsp;e. is in a merry state. A
  <i>pin</i> was a name for a wooden peg; and <i>to hang on a pin</i> was
  to be hung up conspicuously. Palsgrave, p. 844, has: 'Upon a mery pynne,
  <i>de hayt</i>; as, <i>il a le cueur de hayt</i>'; cf. '<i>Hait</i>,
  liveliness, ... cheerfulness' in Cotgrave. Halliwell gives: '<i>on the
  pin</i>, on the <i>qui vive</i>.' Later, the phrase became <i>in a merry
  pin</i>, i.&nbsp;e. in a good humour; but this is thought to refer to the pins
  or pegs in a 'peg-tankard'; see <i>Pin</i> in Nares. Cowper, in his John
  Gilpin, has 'in merry pin.'</p>

  <p>1523. See Seneca, De Beneficiis, capp. 14-16; Lounsbury, Studies, ii.
  270. However, it is <i>really</i> taken from Map's Epistola Valerii, c.
  9: 'Philosophicum est: Videto cui des. Ethica est: Videto cui te
  des.'&mdash;Anglia, xiii. 183. Cf. P. Plowman, B. vii. 74, and the
  note.</p>

  <p>1535. <i>chydester</i>, the feminine form of <i>chyder</i>, which is
  the form used in MSS. Pt. and Hl. I can find no other example; but, in
  the Romaunt of the Rose, ll. 150, 4266, we find <i>chideresse</i>.</p>

  <p>1536. <i>mannish wood</i>, with masculine manners, and mad;
  virago-like. Certainly the right reading, and found in E. Hn. Cm.
  Unluckily, Tyrwhitt and others have adopted the nonsensical reading of
  Pt. and Hl., viz. <i>a man is wood</i>! Cp. Ln. have <i>of maneres
  wood</i>, which is better, but is clearly a mere substitution for the
  original <i>mannish</i>. For <i>mannish</i>, masculine, we have Chaucer's
  own authority; see B. 782, and the note.</p>

  <p>1538. 'A metaphor from horses, meaning, No woman is without faults,
  just as there is no horse which will trot perfectly sound in all
  respects.'&mdash;Bell. From Albertano of Brescia, Liber de Amore Dei:
  'Nulla tam bona uxor, in qua non inuenias quod
  queraris.'&mdash;Köppel.</p>

  <p>1553. 'I know best where my shoe pinches me.' This story has been
  already alluded to; see D. 492, and the note.</p>

  <p>1558. Tyrwhitt has:&mdash;'By him that made water, <i>fire</i>, erthe,
  and aire.' This will not scan, and the word <i>fire</i> is introduced
  merely to please the editor, being found in none of the seven MSS., nor
  in the old editions. When Chaucer wishes to mention <i>all</i> the four
  elements, he does so; see A. 1246, 2992.</p>

  <p>1560-1. From Le Rom. de la Rose, 14055-6:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Car cil a moult poi de savoir</p>
      <p>Qui seus cuide sa fame avoir.'</p>

  </div>

  <p>1582. Cf. Boeth. bk. v. met. 4. 8; Troil. i. 365; Ayenb. of Inwyt, p.
  158.</p>

  <p>1584. E. Hn. have <i>se ful many</i>, but the rest omit <i>ful</i>.
  Scan the <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page359"></a>[359]</span>line by reading <i>many a</i> in one foot,
  and making <i>figúr-e</i> trisyllabic, as in B. 3412, E. 16.</p>

  <p>1592. <i>voys</i>, fame, general approval.</p>

  <p>1609. Read <i>inpossíbl'</i>, and <i>wer-e</i>. <i>were</i>, would
  be.</p>

  <p>1640-1. The seven deadly sinnes, for which see the Persones Tale. 'The
  popular medieval treatises on the seven sins arrange the minor
  transgressions connected with each as <i>branches</i> of the primary
  tree.'&mdash;Wright. And each of the <i>branches</i> have <i>twigs</i>,
  as Chaucer himself says; see I. 389. Cf. my note to P. Plowman, C. viii.
  70.</p>

  <p>1665. <i>forbed-e</i>, may (God) forbid. <i>sente</i>, subj., could
  send.</p>

  <p>1682. This line is incomplete in all the seven MSS. There is a pause
  at the caesura, so that the word <i>for</i> occupies the whole of the
  third foot. Tyrwhitt conceals this fact by inserting <i>but</i> before
  <i>thinne</i>. Cf. D. 1647, and the note.</p>

  <p>1684-7. These four parenthetical lines interrupt the story rather
  awkwardly. They obviously belong to the narrator, the Marchant, as it is
  out of the question that Justinus had heard of the Wife of Bath. Perhaps
  it is an oversight.</p>

  <p>If we take these lines in this way, it is necessary to read <i>we
  have</i> in l. 1686, as in Hn. The other MSS. and editions read <i>ye
  have</i>. I explain 'which we have on honde' as meaning, 'which we are
  now discussing.' Moreover, the reading <i>we</i> is exactly appropriate
  after the reading <i>us</i> of l. 1684, where it is difficult to see how
  <i>us</i> can refer to any but the Canterbury pilgrims.</p>

  <p>1693. <i>Maius</i> is a masculine form, because the name of the month
  is so; see l. 1748.</p>

  <p>1702. <i>sacrement</i>, i.&nbsp;e. of marriage; see l. 1319. The couple
  also used to 'receive the sacrament,' i.&nbsp;e. the eucharist, in the modern
  sense.</p>

  <p>1704. Referring to the prayers in the marriage service, which mention
  Isaac and Rebecca, and Abraham and Sarah.</p>

  <p>1709-52. Quoted by Warton, Hist. E. Poetry, ed. 1871, ii. 354.</p>

  <p>1716. <i>Orpheus</i>, the celebrated minstrel, whose story is in Ovid,
  Met. x. 1-85; xi. 1-66. Mentioned again in the Book of the Duchesse, 569;
  House of Fame, 1203; Troil. iv. 791. For the minstrelsy at the feast, cf.
  F. 78.</p>

  <p><i>Amphioun</i>, Amphion, king of Thebes, who helped to build Thebes
  by the magic of his music; Hyginus, Fab. 6 and 7; cf. Ovid, Met. vi. 221,
  271, 402; xv. 427. Already mentioned in connexion with Thebes in A. 1546.
  (The <i>i</i> is shortened.)</p>

  <p>1719. Cf. 'Ther herde I trumpe Ioab also'; Ho. of Fame, 1245. 'Joab
  blew a trumpet,' 2 Sam. ii. 28; xviii. 16; xx. 22.</p>

  <p>1720. <i>Theodomas</i>; also mentioned in the above passage, Ho. of
  Fame, 1246. As he blew a trumpet at Thebes, when the city was in fear (or
  danger), he is clearly to be identified with the Thiodamas mentioned in
  the Thebaid of Statius. He succeeded Amphiaraus as augur, and furiously
  excited the besiegers to attack Thebes. His invocation was succeeded by a
  great sound of trumpets (Theb. viii. <!-- Page 360 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>[360]</span>343), but Statius does
  not expressly say that he blew a trumpet himself.</p>

  <p>1723. <i>Venus</i>; cf. F. 272-274.</p>

  <p>1727. <i>fyrbrond</i>, fire-brand, torch; which she carried as
  appropriate to the marriage procession. This attribute of Venus is found
  in Le Roman de la Rose, l. 3434:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Ele tint ung brandon flamant</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Observe that l. 2250 of the Legend of Good Women runs
  thus:&mdash;'N'Ymenëus, that god of wedding is.' This agrees with line
  1730 except as regards the prefixed <i>Ne</i>. The 'fire-brand' reappears
  in l. 1777 below.</p>

  <p>1731. <i>his lyf</i>, i.&nbsp;e. during his life, in all his life.</p>

  <p>1732. <i>Marcian.</i> Chaucer is still thinking of his own House of
  Fame (cf. notes to ll. 1719, 1720), where he had already mentioned
  Marcian, at l. 985. Martianus Minneus Felix Capella, a native of
  Carthage, was a writer of the fifth century, and wrote the Nuptials of
  Philology and Mercury, <i>De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</i>. This
  consists of two books, immediately followed by seven books on the Seven
  Sciences; see Warton's Hist. E. Poetry, ed. 1871, iii. 77; Smith's
  Classical Dictionary, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Capella</i>; Lydgate's Temple of Glass, l.
  130.</p>

  <p>1734. <i>hir</i>; cf. 'he, Theofraste,' in l. 1294; also ll. 1368,
  1373. For <i>him</i> (as in E. Cm.), MSS. Hn. Hl. have <i>he</i>
  (badly).</p>

  <p>1745. <i>Assuer</i>, Ahasuerus, as in l. 1374. There is a special
  reference here to the banquet at which Esther obtained her request; see
  Esther, v. 6. See further in Warton, Hist. E. Poetry, ed. 1871, i. 288,
  iii. 142.</p>

  <p>1754. For other allusions to Paris and Eleyne, see Parl. of Foules,
  290, 291; Book of the Duch. 331.</p>

  <p>1783. The word 'Auctor' in the margin of MS. E. signifies that ll.
  1783-1794 form a reflection on the subject by the author, who here
  personates the Marchant. There are similar passages further on, viz. ll.
  1866-1874, 2057-2068, 2107-2115, and 2125-2131.</p>

  <p>1784. <i>bedeth</i>, proffers; cf. G. 1065. From Boeth. bk. iii. pr.
  5. 50.</p>

  <p>1785. <i>false hoomly hewe</i>, O false domestic servant! Cp. Pt. Ln.
  have the reading <i>holy</i>, which doubtless arose, as Wright points
  out, from missing the mark of abbreviation in the form 'h&#x14D;ly,'
  i.&nbsp;e. ho<i>m</i>ly. 'Tyrwhitt, however,' he adds, 'adopts this reading,
  mistakes the meaning of the word <i>hewe</i>, adds <i>of</i>, which is
  found in none of the MSS.; and in his text it stands <i>false of holy
  hewe</i>, which he supposes to signify false of holy colour. Conjectural
  emendations are always dangerous.' Yet Wright <i>silently adopts</i> such
  emendations over and over again; cf. l. 1812 below. Cf. <i>hoomly fo</i>
  in ll. 1792, 1794.</p>

  <p>1786. 'Like the sly and treacherous snake in the bosom.' This refers
  to the fable in Phaedrus, lib. iv. fab. 18. But Chaucer probably <!--
  Page 361 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page361"></a>[361]</span>took
  it from the Gesta Romanorum, ch. clxxiv. For numerous references, see the
  Exempla of Jacques de Vitry, ed. Crane, 1890, p. 201.</p>

  <p>1790. Here the monosyllabic pp. <i>born</i> takes a final <i>e</i> in
  the definite form, as noticed by Prof. Child; see Ellis, E.&nbsp;E. Pronunc.
  p. 350, § 32. Cf. <i>her dreint-e lord</i>, Gower, C.&nbsp;A., ii. 105; and
  see B. 69.</p>

  <p>1793. From Boethius, lib. iii. pr. 5:&mdash;'Quae uero pestis
  efficacior ad nocendum, quàm familiaris inimicus?' See vol. ii. p.
  63.</p>

  <p>1795. <i>his ark diurne</i>, the daily arc of his apparent motion. See
  Chaucer on the Astrolabe, pt. ii. § 7:&mdash;'To knowe the <i>arch of the
  day</i>'; or, as in l. 7 of the same:&mdash;'tak ther thyn <i>ark of the
  day</i>.'</p>

  <p>1797. <i>On thorisonte</i>, upon the horizon; i.&nbsp;e. the time was come
  for the sun to descend <i>below</i> it.</p>

  <p><i>that latitude</i>; because the apparent motion of the sun depends
  upon the latitude as well as upon the day of the year; cf. the Treatise
  on the Astrolabe, pt. ii. § 13.</p>

  <p>1799. <i>hemisperie</i>, the hemisphere above the horizon; see the
  Treatise on the Astrolabe, pt. i. § 18.</p>

  <p>1807. <i>ipocras</i>, the usual medieval spelling of Hippocrates; but
  the name is here given to a prepared drink. Halliwell (s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>Hippocras</i>) defines it as 'a beverage composed of wine, with spices
  and sugar, strained through a cloth. It is said to have taken its name
  from <i>Hippocrates' sleeve</i>, the term [which] apothecaries gave to a
  strainer.' Long and elaborate recipes for it exist, and may be found in
  the Babees Book, ed. Furnivall, pp. 125 and 267; and in Halliwell's
  Dictionary, s.&nbsp;v. <i>ipocras</i>. The shortest is that in Arnold's
  Chronicle:&mdash;'Take a quarte of red wyne, an ounce of synamon, and
  halfe an unce of gynger; a quarter of an ounce of greynes [i.&nbsp;e.
  cardamoms], and longe peper, and half a pounde of suger; and brose
  [bruise] all this, and than put them in a bage of wullen clothe, made
  therefore [i.&nbsp;e. for the purpose], with the wyne; and lete it hange over
  a vessel, tyll the wyne be rune thorowe.' All the recipes insist upon the
  straining, and some direct the use of as many as six straining-bags. See
  Our English Home, p. 83.</p>

  <p><i>clarree</i>, clarified wine; see note to A. 1471.</p>

  <p><i>vernage</i>, a sweet wine, sometimes red, but more often white;
  'grown in Tuscany, and other parts of Italy, and [it] derived its name
  from the thick-skinned grape, <i>vernaccia</i> (corresponding with the
  <i>vinaciola</i> of the ancients), that was used in the preparation of
  it. The wine known as <i>vernaccia</i> in Tuscany was always of a white
  or golden colour. See Bacci, Nat. Vinor. Hist., pp. 20,
  62.'&mdash;Henderson, Hist. of Ancient and Modern Wines, 1824; quoted in
  the Babees Book, ed. Furnivall, p. 203. Florio's Ital. Dict.
  gives:&mdash;'<i>Vernaccia</i>, a kinde of strong wine like malmesie or
  muskadine, or bastard wine.' Chaucer speaks of it again, in conjunction
  with <i>malvesye</i>; see B. 1261. For other notices of it, see Babees
  Book, pp. 125, 267, and the Glossary; Halliwell, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Piment</i>;
  Gower, C.&nbsp;A., iii. 8; Squyer of Lowe Degree, l. 754. The derivation,
  sometimes given, of <i>vernage</i> from <i>Verona</i>, is clearly wrong.

  Med. Æt. t. i. p. 423, ed. Pat. 4to., wrote about the year 1080. His

  <p>1812. <i>nas no-thing eschu</i>, was not at all remiss, or <i>shy</i>.
  Cm. Ln. read <i>was</i>; the rest <i>nas</i>; but the sense is the same.
  Tyrwhitt reads&mdash;<i>he wolde nothing eschue</i>. Wright says: 'the
  Harl. MS. reads <i>nas</i>, which seems not to furnish so good a
  grammatical construction'; accordingly, he reads&mdash;<i>he wold nothing
  eschieu</i>. Morris likewise reads <i>wolde</i>; and Bell reads
  <i>wold</i>. But the editors are all wrong; for the verb <i>eschew-e</i>
  will not rime with <i>coitu</i>, and it is clear that they did not know
  that <i>eschu</i> is here <i>an adjective</i>! Yet it occurs again in the
  Pers. Tale, Group I, 971; and I subjoin three more examples.</p>

  <p>Godefroy gives the O. F. adj. <i>eschif</i>, <i>eskif</i>, 'animé de
  sentiments hostiles, défavorables, mauvais, mécontent, de mauvaise
  volonté, rétif.' Amongst his examples, we find the spellings
  <i>eskius</i>, <i>eschius</i>, <i>eskieus</i>, <i>esqueus</i>,
  <i>eskieu</i>, <i>esquieu</i>, <i>esehieu</i>; where the <i><span
  class="nw">-s</span></i> is a case-ending. The O.&nbsp;F. adj. is derived from
  the adj. which appears as M. H. G. <i>schiech</i>, cognate with E.
  <i>shy</i>. Chaucer's <i>eschu</i> is, accordingly, just as good an
  adjective as the mod. E. <i>shy</i>.</p>

  <p>1817. <i>travers</i>, curtain, drawn across to form a screen; as in
  Troil. iii. 674. Ill spelt <i>trauas</i> in the Prompt. Parv., but
  explained by <i>transversum</i>, which is the Low Latin form. See Way's
  note; he quotes&mdash;"i. trauers du satin vermaille," so that they were
  sometimes made of crimson satin. In the Kingis Quair, st. 90, we find the
  form <i>trauerse</i>; in st. 82 it is spelt <i>travesse</i>, and is there
  applied to a screen which happened to be nearly transparent, as was not
  the case in our text. See vol. ii. pp. 478, 506.</p>

  <p>1819. A note in Bell's Chaucer gives a translation of the form of
  blessing the nuptial bed to be found in old service-books.</p>

  <p>1825. <i>houndfish</i>, dog-fish. I suppose this is the spotted
  dog-fish, <i>Scyllium catulus</i>, or <i>Scyllium canicula</i>. Randle
  Holme has: '<i>Dog fish</i>, or <i>Sea dog fish</i>. It is by the Dutch
  termed a <i>Flackhund</i> and a <i>Hundfisch</i>; the skin is hard and
  redish, beset with hard and sharp scales, sharp, and rough and black; the
  Belly is more white and softer.' Bk. ii. ch. xiv. See Gloss. to the
  Babees Book; Lydgate, Minor Poems, p. 201.</p>

<p><!-- Page 363 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>[363]</span></p>

  <p>1840. In the Pers. Tale, Chaucer says just the contrary; see I.
  859.</p>

  <p>1849. <i>shaketh.</i> Cf. 'The slake skin trembleth upon myn empted
  body'; Ch. tr. of Boethius, bk. i. met. 1. 12.</p>

  <p>1862. From Le Rom. de la Rose, 19931-2.</p>

  <p>1879. <i>a penner.</i> 'The penner was a case containing the pens,
  ink, and other apparatus of writing, which the clerk carried about with
  him, as the Eastern students do at the present day. As such articles
  belonged only to clergy and scholars, we understand why the squire Damyan
  was obliged to borrow one for his use. An early vocabulary entitled
  <i>Nominale</i> mentions, among the <i>Nomina rerum pertinentium
  clerico</i>, 'Hoc pennare, <i>a pener</i>.'&mdash;Wright. See
  Wright-Wülcker, Vocab. 682. 15; also 601. 34.</p>

  <p>1881. <i>compleynt.</i> See specimens in Chaucer's Compleints of Mars,
  of Venus, and of Anelida; also the Compleint to his Lady. And cf. F.
  943-948.</p>

  <p>1883. <i>heng</i>, i.&nbsp;e. which hung; the relative is omitted.</p>

  <p>1887. <i>two of Taur</i>, the second degree of Taurus. Tyrwhitt
  unluckily altered <i>two</i> to <i>ten</i>, on the plea that 'the time
  given (<i>four days complete</i>, l. 1893) is not sufficient for the moon
  to pass from the second degree of Taurus into Cancer.' And he then
  proceeds to shew this, taking the <i>mean</i> daily motion of the moon as
  being 13 degrees, 10 minutes, and 35 seconds. But, as Mr. Brae has shewn,
  in his edition of Chaucer's Astrolabe, p. 93, footnote, it is a mistake
  to reckon here the moon's <i>mean</i> motion; we must rather consider her
  <i>actual</i> motion. The question is simply, can the moon move from the
  2nd degree of Taurus to the 1st of Cancer (through 59 degrees) in four
  days? Mr. Brae says decidedly, that examples of such motion are to be
  seen 'in every almanac.'</p>

  <p>E.g. in the Nautical Almanac, in June, 1886, the moon's longitude at
  noon was 30° 22' on the 9th, and 90° 17' on the 13th; i.&nbsp;e. the moon was
  in the <i>first</i> of Taurus on the former day, and in the <i>first</i>
  of Cancer on the latter day, at the same hour; which gives (very nearly)
  a degree more of change of longitude than we here require. The MSS. all
  have <i>two</i> or <i>tuo</i>, and they are quite right. The motion of
  the moon is so variable that the mean motion affords no safe guide.</p>

  <p>1887-8. The <i>i</i> in <i>gliden</i>, <i>biden</i> (as in M. E.
  <i>riden</i>, E. <i>ridden</i>) is short.</p>

  <p>1921. <i>At-after</i>, immediately after; a compound preposition; see
  F. 302.</p>

  <p>1924. <i>a gentil man</i>, a man of rank, as squires usually were,
  although in service, and therefore a <i>hewe</i> (1785). Cf. l. 1907, and
  note to D. 2243.</p>

  <p>1932. This proceeding was quite in accordance with ancient custom. See
  the tale of Eglamore, in the Percy Folio MS., st. 11; and the Ballad of
  Sir Cauline, st. 9.</p>

  <p>1943-4. Misarranged and corrupt in MS. Hl.</p>

  <p>1962. <i>precious</i>, over-nice, scrupulous, prim; as in D. 148.</p>

  <p>1966. <i>evensong.</i> Only Cp. Ln. have <i>euesong</i>. Perhaps
  <i>even</i> was <!-- Page 364 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page364"></a>[364]</span>pronounced as <i>e'en</i> (een); cf.
  <i>yest're'en</i>, <i>Hallowe'en</i>. But <i>eve</i> for <i>even</i> is
  very common.</p>

  <p>1971. For <i>Was</i>, only Hn. Hl. have <i>As</i>. The latter seems to
  afford an easier construction, and is adopted by the editors. But we are
  bound to take the reading <i>Was</i>, as in most MSS., and explain it. I
  take it thus:&mdash;'Whether it were ... that the heavens stood in such a
  condition, that it was a fortunate time.' This is quite exact, though one
  dependent clause on the top of another is not felicitous. The reference
  is, of course, to the old astrological belief about fortunate positions
  of the planets; cf. A. 417. See Boeth. bk. iv. pr. 6, 62-71.</p>

  <p>1986. Chaucer's favourite line; see note to F. 479.</p>

  <p>1991. <i>lete</i>, allowed; A. S. <i>l&#x1E3;ten</i>. MS. Harl. omits
  <i>him</i>.</p>

  <p>2002. <i>visit-è</i>; trisyllabic. See the footnote.</p>

  <p>2013. <i>lowe</i> means 'tractable, docile, obedient'; cf. note to D.
  1369. 'And after that he had with lacke of vitailles brought those
  pratlers as <i>lowe as dogge to the bowe</i>'; Udall, tr. of Erasmus'
  Apophthegmes; Antigonus, § 27. This shews how the dogs were tamed.</p>

  <p>2018. <i>lady</i>, lady's. See note to A. 88.</p>

  <p>2021. 'Alluding to the Epicurean philosophy.'&mdash;Bell. See A.
  335-8.</p>

  <p>2026. <i>honestly</i>, honourably, worthily; cf. l. 2028.</p>

  <p>2032. <i>he</i>, viz. Guillaume de Lorris. There were <i>two</i>
  authors of Le Roman de la Rose, but the reference is here to the earlier
  portion of it; see ll. 130-146, 480-512, 645-688 of the English version,
  where the description of the garden occurs; and for the description of
  the well mentioned in l. 2036, see ll. 1462-1634 of the same.</p>

  <p>2034. 'Hortorum decus et tutela Priapus'; Ovid, Fast. i. 415.</p>

  <p>2038. <i>Pluto.</i> In his Introductory Discourse, Tyrwhitt
  remarks:&mdash;'The machinery of the Fairies, which Chaucer has used so
  happily, was probably added by himself; and indeed, I cannot help
  thinking that his <i>Pluto</i> and <i>Proserpine</i> were the true
  progenitors of <i>Oberon</i> and <i>Titania</i>.... This observation is
  not meant to extend further than <i>the King and Queen</i> of Faery; in
  whose characters I think it is plain that Shakespeare, in imitation of
  Chaucer, has dignified our Gothic Elves with the manners and language of
  the classical Gods and Goddesses. In the rest of his Faery system,
  Shakespeare seems to have followed the popular superstition of his own
  time.'</p>

  <p>This remark is important; I doubt if the influence of Chaucer upon
  Shakespeare in this matter has been sufficiently recognised. In both
  works, the Fairy king and queen have a dispute in hand, which is settled
  by the assistance of mortals.</p>

  <p>Not only here, but in the Hous of Fame, 1509-1511, Chaucer refers us
  to Claudian as his authority for Pluto and Proserpine; see note to l.
  2232 below.</p>

  <p>2046. The insertion of <i>smal</i> is necessary; the rime <i>wiket,
  cliket</i>, being a feminine one.</p>

  <p><i>cliket</i>, (1) a latch, (2) a latch-key; here used in the latter
  sense. In Shropshire, the word is used of a particular kind of fastening
  for a gate, <!-- Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page365"></a>[365]</span>which Miss Jackson thus describes. 'An
  iron link is attached to the gate by means of a staple; this link is
  terminated by a short hasp-like bolt. On the gate-post is an iron plate,
  having in it a kind of key-hole, into which the before-mentioned bolt
  fits, much after the manner of the fastening of a trunk, thus securing
  the gate.'</p>

  <p>2058. <i>scorpion</i>, scorpion; see notes to B. 360, 404; cf. H. 271,
  and see Chaucer's description of the scorpion in the Book of the
  Duchesse, ll. 636-641. Vincent of Beauvais, in his Speculum Naturale, bk.
  xx. c. 160, quotes from the Liber de Naturis Rerum&mdash;'Scorpio blandum
  et quasi virgineum dicitur vultum habere, sed habet in cauda nodosa
  venenatum aculeum, quo pungit et inficit proximantem.' And see Boeth. bk.
  ii. pr. 1. 10-14; Ayenb. of Inwyt, p. 62, l. 13.</p>

  <p>2080. <i>Soul</i>, sole; cf. the law-phrase <i>femme sole</i>. See P.
  de Thaun, Bestiary, 1250; Morris, O.&nbsp;E. Misc. p. 22; Ayenb. of Inwyt, p.
  226.</p>

  <p>2093. <i>Damian</i>, here to be read as <i>Dam-yan</i>, nearly in two
  syllables. <i>Benignely</i>, favourably; altered by Tyrwhitt to
  <i>brenningly</i>, without authority; pronounced <i>benign-e-ly</i>, in
  four syllables.</p>

  <p>2107. 'What might it avail thee if thou couldst see to the very
  horizon?'</p>

  <p>2109. 'For it is just as good to be deceived when blind.'</p>

  <p>2111. See note to A. 1390.</p>

  <p>2115. Cf. 'Of sufferance cometh ease'; in Heywood's Proverbs.</p>

  <p>2117. To scan the line, we must read <i>warm-e</i>, and
  <i>émprentèd</i>. <i>Emprented hath</i> would run much better. The
  scribes who wrote <i>warm</i> probably pronounced the last word as
  <i>clikét</i>; but the rime is feminine. And see l. 2121, 2123.</p>

  <p>2125. The reference is to the story of Pyramus in Ovid, Met. iv. 55;
  especially (in l. 2126) to the line&mdash;'Quid non sentit amor?'</p>

  <p>2127. <i>he</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the lover; used generally. This line answers to
  l. 742 of the Legend of Good Women:&mdash;'But what is that, that
  <i>love</i> can nat espye'; where <i>love</i> means a lover.</p>

  <p>2133. This has to be taken in connexion with ll. 2222-4 below, in
  which the date is said to be <i>a little before June 12</i>; see note to
  the line. Consequently, the 'eight days' mentioned in l. 2132 must be
  <i>the first eight days of June</i>. Again, if we refer to l. 2049, we
  see that January used to go to the garden 'in the summer season,' which
  would seem to be intended to begin with June. Accordingly, the month of
  June is here expressed, in a mere parenthesis, by the phrase 'ere the
  month of July.' Hence the sense really is&mdash;'ere that eight days (of
  the summer season) were passed, (of the month) before that of July.' And
  the whole passage merely means&mdash;'before the 8th of June was over,'
  or simply, 'on June 8.' This date precisely agrees with that given, by
  quite a different method, in ll. 2222-4.</p>

  <p>As the month meant is here certainly that of <i>June</i>, as shewn by
  Mr. Brae in 1851 (see his edition of Chaucer's Astrolabe, pp. 67, 83),
  Mr. Brae proposed to read <i>Juin</i> for <i>Juil</i>. But this was
  because he followed Tyrwhitt's text, which has <i>of</i> for <i>er</i>,
  and therefore reads&mdash; <!-- Page 366 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page366"></a>[366]</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p style="margin-left:4.5em">'er that daies eighte</p>
      <p>Were passed <i>of</i> the month of Juil, befill,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And it is the fact, that, with the reading <i>of</i>, we also should
  have to accept the reading <i>Juin</i>. But we must set against this the
  fact that no MS. (at least of any authority) reads either <i>Juin</i> or
  <i>of</i>! Tyrwhitt has made this alteration <i>silently</i>, and Wright
  and Bell have <i>silently</i> adopted it. Morris also makes the
  alteration, but prints <i>of</i> in italics to shew that it is not the
  reading of his MS. These <i>silent</i> conjectural emendations are very
  troublesome, as they are copied by one editor after another without any
  enquiry as to the sense of the context.</p>

  <p>The Harl. MS., supposed to be followed by Wright, actually has <i>a
  stop</i> before 'er'; the reading being&mdash;'were passid . er the
  moneth of Iuyl bifille.' The reading <i>bifille</i> (might befal) is
  probably due to taking <i>Iuyl</i> as the nominative to this verb,
  whereas <i>bifil</i> is meant to be impersonal, with the sense&mdash;'it
  happened.'</p>

  <p>2138-2148. This passage is almost entirely composed of fragments of
  Solomon's Song. We may compare ll. 2138-2140 with ch. ii. vv. 10, 11, 12;
  l. 2141 with ch. i. v. 15; l. 2142 with ch. iv. v. 10; l. 2143 with ch.
  iv. vv. 12, 16; ll. 2144, 2145 with ch. iv. vv. 9, 10; l. 2146 with ch.
  iv. v. 7.</p>

  <p>2194. The first foot is defective (in all seven MSS.). To fill out the
  line, Tyrwhitt inserts <i>owen</i> before <i>lord</i>; a 'correction'
  which Wright and Bell <i>silently</i> adopt. There is no hint as to the
  source of this <i>owen</i>. Thynne's edition (as frequently elsewhere)
  agrees with the seven MSS.</p>

  <p>2200. This drowning in a sack is quite oriental. Cf. 'There yawns the
  sack, and yonder rolls the sea'; Byron, The Corsair, iii. 8.</p>

  <p>2202. <i>wenche.</i> For this word, cf. H. 220, and Ho. of Fame,
  206.</p>

  <p>2222. <i>in Geminis</i>, in the sign of Gemini. We are also told that
  he was near his 'declination of Cancer,' i.&nbsp;e. his <i>maximum</i>
  northern declination, which he obtains when entering Cancer, at the
  summer solstice. In Chaucer's time, the sun entered Cancer about June 12,
  and therefore just before that day was in Gemini. Taking this statement
  in conjunction with the 'eight days' of the summer season mentioned in l.
  2132, we may feel sure that the date meant is June 8, just four days
  before the sun left Gemini, and attained his maximum declination. See my
  edition of Chaucer's Astrolabe (E. E. T. S.), p. lv., which requires
  partial correction, as shewn in the note to l. 2132 above.</p>

  <p>2224. The 'exaltation' of a planet was the sign in which it was (quite
  arbitrarily) supposed to exercise its greatest power. The exaltation of
  Jupiter was Cancer, as Chaucer correctly says.</p>

  <p>2227. This notion of identifying Pluto with the king of Fairyland
  occurs again in the Romance of Sir Orpheo; see Ritson, Met. Rom. ii. 259.
  Sir Orpheo is the Greek Orpheus, who redeemed Eurydice from 'the kyng of
  fayrè,' i.&nbsp;e. from Pluto. See the remarks on this poem in Warton, Hist.
  E. Poet. ed. 1871, i. 31, 32.</p>

  <p>The construction of this sentence is awkward. Lines 2231-3 are <!--
  Page 367 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page367"></a>[367]</span>parenthetical; <i>Pluto</i> is in
  apposition with <i>This king</i> in l. 2234, and agrees with the verb
  <i>sette</i> in the same.</p>

  <p>2229-30. Tyrwhitt prints these lines differently, thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Folwing his wif, the quene Proserpina,</p>
      <p>Which that he ravisshed out of Ethna.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This reading is from MS. Harl. 7335; and T. adds&mdash;'In some other
  MSS. <i>Ethna</i>, by a manifest error of the copyist, has been changed
  into <i>Proserpina</i> [as in Cp. Pt. Ln.]. The passage being thus made
  nonsense, other transcribers left out the [second] line, and substituted
  in its stead&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Eche after other, right as any lyne.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But it would appear that the line just quoted, which Tyrwhitt
  pronounces to be a substitution, is really the original reading, and we
  must not hastily reject it. It is found in E. Cm. and Hl., whilst in Hn.
  the line has been erased or omitted, and then filled in (in a spurious
  form) by a later hand.</p>

  <p>Wright and Bell have followed Tyrwhitt's lead, and altered the passage
  accordingly. Morris silently changes the <i>preserpine</i> of the Harl.
  MS. to <i>Preserpina</i>, and gives the next line in the objectionable
  form&mdash;'Whiche that he ravysched out of <i>Cecilia</i>' (Sicily).</p>

  <p>It seems very much better to restore the original reading, especially
  when we notice that <i>Próserpýne</i> (not Prosérpiná) is the undoubted
  reading in the House of Fame, 1511, and that <i>quen-e</i> is constantly
  dissyllabic (see B. 161, 1671, G. 1089), In l. 2264, we again have
  <i><span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Próserpýn'."
  >Próserpýne</span> </i>. The old black-letter editions are not of much
  value; still they give line 2230 as in my text, except that they wrongly
  change <i>any</i> into <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>2232. <i>Claudian</i>; Claudius Claudianus, at the close of the fourth
  century, wrote an epic poem in three books <i>De raptu Proserpinae</i>,
  which he left unfinished, besides several other works. He is mentioned
  again in the Ho. of Fame, 449, 1509. The story of Proserpine is also in
  Ovid, Fasti, iv. 427; and in Gower, C.&nbsp;A., ii. 170.</p>

  <p>2240. The line is plainly imperfect, both in sense and rhythm, yet is
  the same in all seven MSS. and in ed. 1550. They agree in
  reading:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ten hundred thousand telle(n) I can.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Tyrwhitt reads:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ten hundred thousand <i>stories</i> tell I can.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He does not tell us where he found the word <i>stories</i>. Wright and
  Bell silently adopt <i>stories</i>; Morris inserts it between square
  brackets. It occurs, however, in a parallel line, F. 1412, as well as in
  a similar passage in the Leg. of Good Women, Prol. A. 274.</p>

  <p>2247. From Eccles. vii. 28. Cf. B. 2247, where Chaucer quotes the same
  passage.</p>

  <p>2250. I.&nbsp;e. the author of Ecclesiasticus. This book contains both
  praise and dispraise of women; see Ecclus. xxiii. 22-26; xxv. 17-26; <!--
  Page 368 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>[368]</span>xxvi.
  1-3, 7-16, 22-27; xxxvi. 21-24; xl. 19, 23; xlii. 9-14. The dispraise
  predominates.</p>

  <p>2252. <i>wilde fyr</i>; see A. 4172, and the note.</p>

  <p>2264. 'So you shall, if you so wish.'</p>

  <p>2265. 'I swear by the soul of my mother's sire'; i.&nbsp;e. by Saturn
  (Ovid, Fasti, vi. 285). The wisdom of Saturn is referred to in A. 2444.
  Tyrwhitt altered <i>sires</i> into <i>Ceres</i>, for which I find no
  authority. Wright notes that Hl. has <i>sires</i>, and Ln. <i>sire</i>;
  and adds&mdash;'Ceres is of course the word intended.' I see no evidence
  for it; and I do not admit that an editor should alter all that he fails
  to understand.</p>

  <p>2273. <i>visage</i>, pronounced (vizaa·j), the <i>e</i> being elided.
  We still say 'to <i>face</i> a thing out.' 'Suffolk doth not flatter,

<p class="ac lg125">NOTES TO GROUP F.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Squieres Tale.</b></p>

  <p>1. There is nothing to link this tale with the preceding one; hence it
  begins a new Group. In many MSS. (including E.) it follows the preceding
  Epilogue without any break. In other MSS. it follows the Man of Law's
  Tale; but that is the wrong place for it. See note to B. 1165; also vol.
  iii. p. 462.</p>

  <p>2. An allusion to Prol. l. 97, unless (which is quite as probable) the
  passage in the Prologue was written afterwards.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Sarray</i>, Sarai. This place has been identified, past all
  doubt, by Colonel Yule in his edition of Marco Polo's Travels, vol. i. p.
  5, and vol. ii. p. 424. The modern name is Tzarev, near Sarepta. Sarepta
  is easily found on any good map of Russia by following the course of the
  Volga from its mouth <i>upwards</i>. At first this backward course runs
  N. W. till we have crossed the province of Astrakhan, when it makes a
  sudden bend, at Sarepta and Tsaritzin. Tsarev is now a place of no
  importance, but the ancient Sarai was so well known, that the Caspian Sea
  was sometimes named from it; thus it is called 'the sea of Sarain' in
  Marco Polo, ed. Yule, ii. 424; 'the sea of Sarra' in the Catalan map of
  1375; and Mare Seruanicum, or the Sea of Shirwan, by Vincent of Beauvais.
  Thynne, in his Animadversions on Speight's Chaucer, speaks to the same
  effect, and says of 'Sara' that it is 'a place yet well knowen, and
  bordering vppon the lake Mare Caspium.' Sarai was the place where Batu
  Khan, the grandson of Gengis Khan, held his court. Batu, with his
  Mongolian followers known as the <i>Golden Horde</i>, had established an
  empire in Kaptchak, or Kibzak, now S.&nbsp;E. Russia, about <span
  class="sm">A. D.</span> 1224. The Golden Horde further invaded Russia,
  and made Alexander Newski grand-duke of it, <span class="sm">A. D.</span>
  1252. (See <i>Golden Horde</i> in Haydn's Dictionary of Dates.)</p>

  <p>Chaucer has here confused two accounts. There were two celebrated
  Khans, both grandsons of Gengis Khan, who were ruling about the same
  time. Batu Khan held his court at Sarai, and ruled over the S. E. of
  Russia; but the Great Khan, named Kublai, held his court at Cambaluc, the
  modern Pekin, in a still more magnificent manner. And it is easy to see
  that, although Chaucer <i>names</i> Sarai, his description really
  <i>applies to</i> Cambaluc. See vol. iii. pp. 471-2. <!-- Page 371
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371"></a>[371]</span></p>

  <p>10. <i>Russye</i>, Russia; invaded by the Golden Horde, as just
  explained. The end of the Tartar influence in Russia was in the year
  1481, when Svenigorod, general of Ivan III., defeated them at the battle
  of Bielawisch. In the following year Ivan assumed the title of czar.</p>

  <p>12. <i>Cambinskan</i>; so in all seven MSS. (Six-text and Harleian),
  except that in the Ellesmere MS. it more resembles <i>Cambyuskan</i>. Yet
  Tyrwhitt prints <i>Cambuscan</i>, probably in deference to Milton, who,
  however, certainly accents the word wrongly, viz. on the second syllable;
  Il Penseroso, l. 110. Thynne, in his Animadversions on Speight's Chaucer,
  speaking of the year 1240, says&mdash;'whiche must be in the tyme of the
  fyrst Tartariane emperor called <i>Caius canne</i>, beinge, I suppose, he
  whome Chaucer namethe <i>Cambiuscan</i>, for so ys [it in] the written
  copies, such affynytye is there betwene those two names.' Now, although
  the celebrated Gengis Khan died probably in 1227, the allusion to the
  'fyrst Tartariane emperor' is clear; so that Thynne makes the forms
  <i>Cambius</i>, <i>Caius</i> (perhaps miswritten for C&#x101;ius, i.&nbsp;e.
  Ca<i>m</i>ius) and <i>Gengis</i> all equivalent. But this is the very
  result for which Colonel Yule has found authority, as explained in vol.
  iii. p. 471; to which the reader is referred. It is there explained that
  Chaucer has again confused two accounts; for, whilst he <i>names</i>
  Gengis Khan (the first 'Grand Khan'), his description really
  <i>applies</i> to Kublai Khan, his grandson, the celebrated 'Grand Khan'
  described by Marco Polo.</p>

  <p>and this is the reading which I have adopted in the text. However, I
  have since observed that Chaucer twice makes <i>pi-e-tous</i>
  trisyllabic, viz. in Troil. iii. 1444, v. 451; and the Hengwrt MS. has
  the same spelling here. The common reading, with this alteration, becomes

  <p>31. <i>Cambalo.</i> I have no doubt that this name was suggested by
  the <i>Cambaluc</i> of Marco Polo. See vol. iii. p. 472.</p>

  <p>39. <i>longing for</i>, belonging to. Cf. <i>longen</i>, Kn. Ta. 1420
  (A. 2278).</p>

  <p>44. <i>I deme</i>, I suppose. This looks as if Chaucer had read some
  account of a festival made by the Grand Khan on <i>one</i> of his
  birthdays, from which he inferred that he <i>always</i> held such a feast
  every year; as, indeed, was the case. See vol. iii. p. 473.</p>

  <p>45. <i>He leet don cryen</i>, he caused (men) to have the feast cried.
  The use of both <i>leet</i> and <i>don</i> is remarkable; cf. E. 523. He
  gave his orders to his officers, and they took care that the proclamation
  was made.</p>

  <p>47. It is not clear <i>why</i> Chaucer hit upon this day in
  particular. Kublai's birthday was in September, but perhaps Chaucer noted
  that the White Feast was on New Year's day, which he took to mean the
  vernal equinox, or some day near it. The day, however, is well defined.
  The 'last Idus' is the very day of the Ides, i.&nbsp;e. March 15. The sun
  entered Aries, according to Chaucer (Treatise on the Astrolabe, ii. 1. 4)
  on March 12, at the vernal equinox; and, as a degree answers to a day
  very nearly, would be in the <i>first</i> degree of Aries on the 12th, in
  the <i>second</i> on the 13th, in the <i>third</i> on the 14th, in the
  <i>fourth</i> on the 15th, and in the <i>fifth</i> (or at the end of the
  <i>fourth</i>) on the 16th, as Chaucer most expressly says below; see
  note to l. 386. The sign Aries was said, in astrology, to be the
  <i>exaltation</i> of the Sun, or that sign in which the Sun had most
  influence for good or ill. In particular, the 19th degree of Aries, for
  some mysterious reason, was selected as the Sun's exaltation, when most
  exactly reckoned. Chaucer says, then, that the Sun was in the sign of
  Aries, in the fourth degree of that sign, and therefore nigh (and
  approaching to) the 19th degree, or his special degree of exaltation.
  Besides this, the poet says the sun was in the 'face' of Mars, and in the
  mansion of Mars; for '<i>his</i> mansioun' in l. 50 means <i>Mars's</i>
  mansion. This is exactly in accordance with the astrology of the period.
  Each sign, such as Aries, was said to contain 30 degrees, or 3
  <i>faces</i>; a <i>face</i> being 10 degrees. The first face of Aries
  (degrees 1-10) was called the face of Mars, the second (11-20) the face
  of the Sun, the third (21-30) that of Venus. Hence the sun, being in the
  fourth degree, was in Mars's <i>face</i>. Again, every planet had its
  (so-called) <i>mansion</i> or <i>house</i>; whence Aries was called the
  mansion of Mars, Taurus that of Venus, Gemini that of Mercury, &amp;c.
  See Chaucer's Astrolabe, in vol. iii. p. lxxviii; or Johannis Hispalensis
  Isagoge in Astrologiam, which gives all the technical terms.</p>

  <p>50. <i>Martes</i> is a genitive from the nom. <i>Mart.</i> or
  <i>Marte</i> (A. 2021), which is itself formed, as usual, from the Latin
  acc. <i>Martem</i>. <!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page373"></a>[373]</span></p>

  <p>51. In the old astrology, different qualities are ascribed to the
  different signs. Thus Aries is described as <i>choleric and fiery</i> in
  MS. Trin. Coll. Cam. R. 15. 18, tract 3, p. 11. So, too, Tyrwhitt quotes
  from the Calendrier des Bergers that Aries is 'chault et sec,' i.&nbsp;e. hot
  and dry.</p>

  <p>53. <i>agayn</i>, against, opposite to. So also in Kn. Ta. 651 (A.
  1509).</p>

  <p>54. <i>What for</i>; cf. Mod. Eng. <i>what with</i>. See Kn. Tale, 595
  (A. 1453).</p>

  <p>59. <i>deys</i>, raised platform, as at English feasts. But this is in
  Marco Polo too; see vol. iii. p. 473. Cf. Kn. Tale, l. 1342 (A. 2200);
  and note to Prol. l. 370.</p>

  <p>63. In a similar indirect manner, Chaucer describes feasts, &amp;c.
  elsewhere: see Kn. Ta. 1339 (A. 2197); Man of Lawes Tale, B. 701-707. And
  Spenser imitates him; F.&nbsp;Q. i. 12. 14; v. 3. 3.</p>

  <p>67. <i>sewes</i>, seasoned broths. '<i>Sewes</i> and potages'; Babees
  Book, ed. Furnivall, p. 151, l. 523; cf. p. 149, l. 509.</p>

  <p>68. Mr. Wright's note on the line is&mdash;'It is hardly necessary to
  observe that <i>swans</i> were formerly eaten at table, and considered
  among the choicest ornaments of the festive board. Tyrwhitt informs us
  that at the intronization of Archbp. Nevil, 6 Edward iv, there were
  "Heronshawes iiijc." [i.&nbsp;e. 400]; Leland's Collectanea, vi. 2: and that
  at another feast in 1530 we read of "16 <i>Heronsews</i>, every one
  12<i>d</i>"; Peck's Desiderata Curiosa, ii. 12.' <i>Heronsew</i> is
  derived from A.&nbsp;F. <i>heronceau</i>, variant of <i>heroncel</i>. Godefroy
  gives <i>herouncel</i>, from the Liber Custumarum, i. 304 (14 Edw. II.),
  and the pl. <i>heroncaulx</i> in an account dated 1330. Cotgrave only has
  'Haironneau, a young heron,' and 'Hairon, a heron, herne,
  <i>herneshaw</i>.' Halliwell quotes 'Ardeola, an <i>hearnesew</i>' from
  Elyot's Dict. 1559, and the form <i>herunsew</i> from Reliquiae Antiquae,
  i. 88. Certainly <i>heronsewe</i> is the name of a bird, not of a dish,
  as some have guessed, by comparing the <i>sewes</i> in l. 67. In fact,
  the word <i>heronsew</i> (for heron) is still used in Swaledale,
  Yorkshire. And in Hazlitt's old Plays (The Disobedient Child), vol. ii.
  p. 282, we have&mdash;</p>

  <i>Heroncel</i>, or <i><span class="nw">-ceu</span></i>, or <i><span

  <p>73. <i>pryme</i>; the word <i>prime</i> seems to mean, in Chaucer, the
  first quarter of the day, reckoned from 6 <span class="sm">A.M.</span> to
  6 <span class="sm">P.M.</span>; and more particularly, the <i>end</i> of
  that period, i.&nbsp;e. 9 <span class="sm">A.M.</span> In the Nonne Prestes
  Tale, B. 4387, the cock crew at <i>prime</i>, or 9 <span

  must proceed quickly with his story. The word is used in different senses
  by different writers. <!-- Page 374 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page374"></a>[374]</span></p>

  <p>75. <i>firste</i>, first design or purpose. I believe this reading is
  right. MS. Harl. has <i>purpos</i>, which will not scan: unless <i>my</i>
  be omitted, as in Tyrwhitt, though that MS. retains <i>my</i>. MSS. Cp.
  Ln. insert <i>purpos</i> as well as <i>firste</i>, making the line too
  long: whilst Hn. Cm. Pt. agree with the text here given, from MS. E.</p>

  <p>Warton observes&mdash;'See a fine romantic story of a Comte de Macon
  who, while revelling in his hall with many knights, is suddenly alarmed
  by the entrance of a gigantic figure of a black man, mounted on a black
  steed. This terrible stranger, without receiving any obstruction from
  guards or gates, rides directly forward to the high table, and, with an
  imperious tone, orders the count to follow him&mdash;Nic. Gillos. Chron.
  ann. 1120.' Alexander rode into a hall up to the high table, according to
  the romance, ed. Weber, l. 1083. See also Warton's Obs. on the Fairy
  Queen, p. 202; the Ballad of King Estmere; and Stowe's Survey of London,

  <p>95. Sir Gawain, nephew to king Arthur, according to the British
  History which goes by the name of Geoffrey of Monmouth, is always upheld
  as a model of courtesy in the French romances and the English
  translations of them. He is often contrasted with Sir Kay, who was
  equally celebrated for churlishness. See the Percy Folio MS.; Sir Gawain,
  ed. by Sir F. Madden; Sir Gawain and the Grene Knight, ed. by Dr. Morris;
  the Morte D'Arthur, &amp;c. Cf. Rom. Rose, 2205-12.</p>

  <p>103. <i>Accordant</i>, according. The change from the Fr. <i><span

  <p>106. <i>style</i>, stile. Such puns are not common in Chaucer; cf. E.

  <p>116. <i>day naturel.</i> In his Treatise on the Astrolabe, pt. ii. c.
  7 (see vol. iii. p. 194), Chaucer explains that the day <i>artificial</i>
  is the time from sunrise to sunset, which varies; to which he
  adds&mdash;'but the <i>day natural</i>, that is to seyn 24 houres, is the
  revolucioun of the equinoxial with as moche partie of the zodiak as the
  sonne of his propre moevinge passeth in the mene whyle.' See note to B.
  2.</p>

  <p>122. <i>the air</i>, pronounced <i>th'air</i>, as usual with Chaucer;
  see D. 1939.</p>

  <p>129. <i>wayted</i>, watched; alluding to the care with which the maker
  watched for the moment when the stars were in a propitious position,
  according to the old belief in astrology.</p>

  <p>131. <i>seel</i>, seal. Mr. Wright notes that 'the making and
  arrangement <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  operations of medieval magic, and treatises on this subject are found in
  MSS.' He refers to MS. Arundel, no. 295, fol. 265. <i>Solomon's seal</i>
  is still commemorated in the name of a flower.</p>

  <p>132. <i>mirour.</i> For some account of this, see vol. iii. p. 476,
  and note to l. 231.</p>

  <p>137. <i>over al this</i>, besides all this. Elsewhere <i>over-al</i>
  is a compound word, meaning <i>everywhere</i>; as in Prol.

  l. 182. Cf. <i>sit</i> for <i>sitteth</i> in l. 179, <i>hit</i> for
  <i>hideth</i> in l. 512, and note to E. 1151.</p>

  <p>184. 'By means of any machine furnished with a windlass or a pulley.'
  The modern <i>windlass</i> looks like a compound of <i>wind</i> and
  <i>lace</i>, but really stands for <i>windel-as</i>, variant of the form
  <i>windas</i> here used. The confusion would be facilitated by the fact
  that there was another form <i>windlas</i> (probably from <i>wind</i> and
  <i>lace</i>) with a different meaning, viz. that of a circuitous way or
  path; see note to Hamlet, ii. 1. 65 (Clar. Press). In the Promptorium
  Parvulorum, our word is spelt both <i>wyndlas</i> and <i>wyndas</i>; p.
  529. The Mid. E. <i>windas</i> may have been derived from the Low-German
  directly, or more probably from the Old French, which has both
  <i>guindas</i> and <i>windas</i>. The meaning and derivation are clearly
  shewn by the Du. <i>windas</i>, which means a winding-axle or capstan,
  from the sb. <i>as</i>, an axle; so, too, the Icel. <i>vindâss</i>. In
  Falconer's Shipwreck, canto 1, note 3, the word <i>windlass</i> is used
  in the sense of capstan.</p>

  <p>190. <i>gauren</i>, gaze, stare. Used again by Chaucer, A. 3827, B.
  3559, and in Troil. and Cres. ii. 1157 (vol. ii. p. 225). In the Clerkes
  Tale (E. 1003), he has <i>gazed</i>. Mr. Wedgwood is perhaps right in
  considering <i>gaze</i> and <i>gaure</i> (also spelt <i>gare</i>) as mere
  variations of the same word. Cf. the adj. <i>garish</i>, i.&nbsp;e. staring,
  in Milton, Il Pens. 141. For the occasional change of <i>s</i> to
  <i>r</i>, see my Principles of Eng. Etymology, i. 379.</p>

  <p><i>gauring</i>, i.&nbsp;e. stupor, occurs in Batman upon Bartholomè, lib.
  vii. c. 7.</p>

  <p>193. <i>Lumbardye</i>, Lombardy, formerly celebrated for horses.
  Tyrwhitt quotes from a patent in Rymer, 2 Edw. II&mdash;'De dextrariis in
  <i>Lumbardiâ</i> emendis,' i.&nbsp;e. of horses to be bought in Lombardy.</p>

  <p>195. <i>Poileys</i>, Apulian. Apulia was called <i>Poille</i> or
  <i>Poile</i> in Old French, and even in Middle English; the phrase 'king
  of <i>Poile</i>' occurs in the Seven Sages (ed. Weber), l. 2019. It was
  celebrated for <!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page376"></a>[376]</span>its horses. Tyrwhitt quotes from MS. James
  vi. 142 (Bodleian Library), a passage in which Richard, archbishop of
  Armagh, in the fourteenth century, has the words&mdash;'nec mulus
  Hispaniae, nec <i>dextrarius Apuliae</i>, nec repedo Æthiopiae, nec
  elephantus Asiae, nec camelus Syriae.' Chaucer ascribes strength and size
  to the horses of Lombardy, and high breeding to those of Apulia.</p>

  <p>200. <i>goon</i>, i.&nbsp;e. move, go about, have motion.</p>

  <p>201. <i>of Fairye</i>, of fairy origin, magical. I do not subscribe to
  Warton's opinion (Obs. on Faerie Queene, p. 86) that this necessarily
  means that it was 'the work of the devil.' Cf. the same expression in
  Piers Pl. B. prol. 6.</p>

  <p>203. Compare the Latin proverb&mdash;'quot homines, tot sententiae.'
  See Hazlitt's Eng. Proverbs, pp. 340, 437. A good epigram on this proverb
  is given in Camden's Remaines concerning Britaine, ed. 1657, sig. Gg.</p>

  <p>207. <i>the Pegasee</i>, Pegasus. In the margin of MSS. E. Hn. Hl. is
  written 'i. equs Pegaseus,' meaning 'id est, equus Pegaseus'; shewing
  that Chaucer was thinking of the adjective <i>Pegaseus</i> rather than of
  the sb. <i>Pegasus</i>, the name of the celebrated winged horse of
  Bellerophon and of the Muses. Cf. Lydgate's Complaint of the Black
  Knight, l. 92.</p>

  <p>209. 'Or else it was the horse of the Greek named Sinon.' This very
  singular-looking construction is really common in Middle English; yet the
  scribe of the Harleian MS. actually writes 'the Grekissch hors Synon,'
  which makes Sinon the <i>name of the horse</i>; and this odd blunder is
  retained in the editions by Wright, Bell, and Morris. The best way of
  clearing up the difficulty is by noting similar examples; a few of which
  are here appended:&mdash;</p>

  name="page377"></a>[377]</span>to Sinon in the House of Fame, i. 152, and
  in the Legend of Good Women, Dido, 8; which shews that he took that
  legend partly from Vergil, Aen. ii. 195. But note that Chaucer here
  compares a horse of <i>brass</i> to the Trojan horse; this is because the
  latter was also said to have been of brass, not by Vergil, but by Guido
  delle Colonne; see note to l. 211. This is why Gower, in his Confess.
  Amant. bk. i., and Caxton, in his Recuyell of the Historyes of Troy, both
  speak of the Trojan horse as a 'horse of brass'; see Spec. of English,
  1394-1579, ed. Skeat, p. 91, l. 67.</p>

  <p>211. <i>olde gestes</i>, old accounts. The account of the taking of
  Troy most valued in the middle ages was not that by Vergil or Homer, but
  the Latin prose story written in 1287 by Guido delle Colonne, who
  obtained a great reputation very cheaply, since he borrowed his work
  almost entirely from an old French <i>Roman de Troie</i>, written by
  Benoit de Sainte-Maure. See the preface to The Gest Hystoriale of the
  Destruction of Troy, ed. Panton and Donaldson (Early English Text
  Society). And see vol. ii. p. lxi.</p>

  the notes.</p>

  Troil. iii. 1687; and pronounce <i>lew-ed-nes</i> fully.</p>

  <p>224. 'They are very prone to put down things to the worst cause.'</p>

  <p>226. <i>maister-tour</i>, principal tower, the donjon or keep-tower.
  So also <i>maistre strete</i>, principal street, Kn. Ta. 2044 (A. 2902);
  <i>maister temple</i>, Leg. of Good Women, l. 1016.</p>

  <p>230. For <i>slye</i>, MS. Hl. has <i>heigh</i>, an inferior reading.
  Mr. Marsh observes upon this line&mdash;'This reasoning reminds one of
  the popular explanation of table-turning and kindred mysteries. Persons
  who cannot detect the trick ... ascribe the alleged facts to
  <i>electricity</i>.... Men love to cheat themselves with hard words, and
  indolence often accepts the <i>name</i> of a phenomenon as a substitute
  for the reason of it'; Origin and Progress of the English Language, Lect.
  ix. p. 427.</p>

  <p>231. The magic mirror in Rome was said to have been set up there by
  Vergil, who was at one time reverenced, not as a poet, but as a great
  enchanter. The story occurs in the Seven Sages, in the Introduction to
  his edition of which Mr. Wright says, at p. lix., 'The story of Virgil's
  tower, which was called <i>salvatio Romae</i>, holds rather a conspicuous
  place in the legendary history of the magician. Such a tower is first
  mentioned, but without the name of Virgil, in a Latin MS. of the eighth
  century, in a passage published by Docen and republished by Keller, in
  his introduction to the <i>Sept Sages</i>. Vincent of Beauvais, in the
  thirteenth century ... describes Virgil's tower; and it is the subject of
  a chapter in the legendary history of Virgilius.' See also the other
  version of the Seven Sages edited by Weber, and reprinted in Mätzner's
  Sprachproben, i. 254; where the <i>mirror</i> is mentioned. <!-- Page 378
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page378"></a>[378]</span>Gower tells
  the story of this mirror in his Confessio Amantis, bk. v. It occurs also
  in the Chronicle of Helinand, and in the Otia Imperialia of Gervase of
  Tilbury; Morley's Eng. Writers, iv. 225. Warton notes that the same
  fiction is in Caxton's Troybook, bk. ii. ch. 22. It also occurs in
  Higden, Polychronicon, bk. i. c. 24.</p>

  <p>232. '<i>Alhazeni et Vitellonis Opticae</i> are extant, printed at
  Basil, 1572. The first is supposed by his editor to have lived about
  <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1100, and the second to <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1270.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. Hole's Brief Biographical
  Dictionary has the notices&mdash;'Alhazel or Alhazen, Arabian Astronomer
  and Optician; died <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1038'; and&mdash;'Vitello
  or Vitellio, Polish Mathematician; floruit circa 1254.' See also the
  remarks in Warton (Hist. Eng. Poetry), on the Clerk's Tale. <i>Alhacen
  (sic)</i> is mentioned in Le Rom. de la Rose, l. 18234. In l. 18376 of
  the same, we find the very phrase: 'Par composicions diverses'; and
  again, in l. 18387: 'Par les diversités des angles.' Mirrors are there
  described at length. R. Scot, in his Discoverie of Witchcraft, bk. xiii.
  c. 19, declares that 'the wonderous deuises and miraculous sights and
  conceipts made and conteined in glasse, doo farre exceed all other.'</p>

  <p>233. Aristotle, the famous Grecian philosopher, born <span
  class="sm">B.C.</span> 384, died 322. <i>writen in hir lyves</i>, wrote

  pres. pl. is <i>wryten</i>; pt. s. <i>wrat</i>, <i>wrot</i>, or

  <p>238. <i>Thelophus.</i> Telephus, king of Mysia, in opposing the
  landing of the Greeks in the expedition against Troy, was wounded by the
  spear of Achilles. But as an oracle declared that the Greeks would
  require his aid, he was healed by means of the rust taken from the same
  spear. Chaucer may easily have learnt this story from his favourite Ovid,
  who says&mdash;</p>

  and Solomon, especially by the Arabs. Moses was supposed to have learnt
  magic from the Egyptians; cf. Acts vii. 22; Exod. vii. 11. See the story
  of the Fisherman and Genie in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, where
  the genie invokes the name of Solomon.</p>

  <p>253. 'Some said it was a wonderful thing to make glass from
  fern-ashes, since glass does not resemble fern-ashes at all.' Glass
  contains two principal ingredients, sand and some kind of alkali. For the
  latter, <!-- Page 379 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page379"></a>[379]</span>the calcined ashes of seaweed, called
  <i>kelp</i>, were sometimes used; or, according to Chaucer, the ashes of
  ferns. Modern chemistry has developed many greater wonders.</p>

  <p>256. 'But, because men have known it (the art of glass-making) so
  long, their talking and wonder about it ceases.' The art is of very high
  antiquity, having been known even to the Egyptians. <i>so fern</i>, so
  long ago; Chaucer sometimes rimes words which are spelt exactly alike,
  but only when their meanings differ. See Prol. l. 17, where <i>seke</i>,
  to seek, rimes with <i>seke</i>, sick. Other examples are seen in the Kn.
  Tale, <i>see</i> being repeated in A. 1955-6; <i>caste</i> in A. 2171-2;
  <i>caas</i> in A. 2357-8; and <i>fare</i> in A. 2435-6. Imperfect rimes
  like <i>disport</i>, <i>port</i>, Prol. 137, 138, are common; see Prol.
  241, 433, 519, 579, 599, 613, 811; Kn. Ta. 379, 381 (A. 1237, 1239),
  &amp;c. For examples of <i>fern</i> compare&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg1">'Ye, farewel al the snow of <i>ferne</i> yere,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. good bye to all last year's snow; Troil. and Cres. v. 1176 (see
  vol. ii. p. 394). So also <i>fernyere</i>, long ago, in P. Pl. B. v. 440;
  spelt <i>uernyere</i>, in Ayenbite of Inwyt, ed. Morris, p. 92. Adverbs
  commonly terminate in <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>, but the scribes
  are right in writing <i>fern</i> here; see A.&nbsp;S. Gospels, Matt. xi. 21,
  for the forms <i>gefyrn</i>, <i>gefern</i>, meaning <i>long ago</i>.
  Occleve, in La Male Regle, 196, uses the expression <i>fern ago</i>,
  i.&nbsp;e. long ago; Poems, ed. Furnivall, p. 31. And in Levins's Manipulus
  Vocabulorum, ed. Wheatley, we find&mdash;'Old farne years, <i>anni
  praeteriti, seculum prius</i>.'</p>

  <p>With these examples in view, we might interpret <i>ferne halwes</i> in
  Chaucer's Prologue, l. 14, by 'olden' rather than by 'distant' saints;
  yet the latter is decisively authenticated by a passage in his
  translation of Boethius, bk. ii. met. 7, where the expression 'renoun
  ysprad to <i>ferne poeples</i>, goth by dyverse tonges,' can only mean
  'distant' peoples. <i>Fern</i>, in the sense of <i>old</i>, is explained
  at once by the Gothic <i>fairnis</i>, old; but, in the sense of
  <i>distant</i>, would seem to be corruptly and incorrectly formed, since
  the A.&nbsp;S. <i>feorran</i>, meaning <i>far</i>, is strictly an adverb, from
  the adjective <i>feorr</i>. But in course of time this adverb came to be
  declined as an adjective; see the examples in Stratmann, s.&nbsp;v.
  <i>feorren</i>.</p>

  <p>263. For a full explanation of this difficult passage, I must be
  content to refer the reader to Mr. Brae's edition of Chaucer's Astrolabe,
  pp. 77 and 86, and my own edition of the same (E. E. T. S.), p. lvi. The
  chief points that now seem tolerably certain are these.</p>

  <p>(1) The Angle Meridional was an astrological term. The heavens were
  divided into twelve equal parts called 'mansions,' and four of <!-- Page
  380 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page380"></a>[380]</span>these
  mansions were technically called 'angles'; the <i>angle meridional</i>
  was the same as the <i>tenth mansion</i>, which was bounded on the one
  edge by the meridian, and on the other by a semi-circle passing through
  the N. and S. points of the horizon, and lying 30° to the E. of the
  meridian; so that, at the equinoxes, at any place situate on the equator,
  the sun would cross this portion of the sky between 10 <span
  class="sm">A. M.</span> and the hour of noon.</p>

  <p>(2) Since this 'angle' corresponds to the end of the forenoon, the sun
  leaves the said angle at the moment of noon, and l. 263 means no more
  than 'it was now past noon.'</p>

  <p>(3) The 'royal beast' means the king of beasts, the lion, and (here in
  particular) the sign of the zodiac named Leo. This sign, on March 15, in
  Chaucer's time, and in the latitude of London, began to 'ascend,' or rise
  above the horizon, just about noon. An additional reason for calling Leo
  'royal' is because the principal star in the constellation is called
  <i>Regulus</i> in Latin, <span title="Basiliskos" class="grk"
  >&Beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&#x1F77;&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  in Greek, and <i>Melikhi</i> in Arabic, all epithets signifying
  <i>kingly</i> or <i>royal</i>.</p>

  <p>(4) But, before the Tartar king rose from the feast, the time past
  noon had so increased that the star called Aldiran, situate in Leo, was
  now rising above the horizon. In other words it was very nearly two
  o'clock. It may be added, that, by the time the <i>whole</i> of the sign
  had ascended, it would be about a quarter to three. Hence Chaucer speaks
  of the sign as yet (i.&nbsp;e. still) ascending.</p>

  <p>The chief remaining point is to fix the star <i>Aldiran</i>.</p>

  <p>Most MSS. read <i>Aldrian</i>, owing to the frequent shifting of
  <i>r</i> in a word; just as <i>brid</i>, for instance, is the old
  spelling of <i>bird</i>. But the Hengwrt MS. is right. The name
  <i>Aldiran</i>, <i>Aldurin</i>, or <i>Aldiraan</i>, occurs in the old
  Parisian star-lists as the name of a star in the constellation Leo, and
  is described in them as being 'in fronte Leonis.' The word means 'the two
  fore-paws,' and the notes of the star's position are such that I am
  persuaded it is the star now called <span class="grk">&theta;</span>
  Hydrae, situate near the Lion's fore-paws, as commonly drawn. The only
  objection to this explanation arises from the comparative insignificance
  of the star; but whoever will take the trouble to examine the old lists
  will see that certain stars were chosen quite as much for the sake of
  <i>position</i> as of <i>brightness</i>. When it was desired to mark
  particular points in the sky, bright stars were chosen if they were
  conveniently placed; but, failing that, any would serve the purpose that
  were fairly distinct. This is why, in a star-list of only 49 stars in MS.
  Camb. Univ. Lib. Ii. 3. 3, such stars as <span class="grk">&delta;</span>
  Capricorni, <span class="grk">&delta;</span> Aquarii, <span
  class="grk">&delta;</span> Ophiuchi, &amp;c., find a place. The star
  <i>Aldiran</i> (<span class="grk">&theta;</span> Hydrae) was remarkable
  for rising, in the latitude of Paris, <i>just before</i> the splendid
  star <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> Leonis of the first magnitude,
  whose coming it thus heralded. That star is <i>also</i> found in the same
  star-lists, with the name <i>Calbalesed</i>, or 'the lion's heart'; in
  Latin, Cor Leonis; another name for it being <i>Regulus</i>, as stated
  above.</p>

  <p>On the whole, we fairly suppose Chaucer's meaning to be, that before
  <!-- Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page381"></a>[381]</span>the feast concluded, it was not only
  <i>past noon</i>, but nearly <i>two hours past noon</i>.</p>

  <p>269. <i>chambre of parements.</i> Tyrwhitt's note is&mdash;'<i>Chambre
  de parement</i> is translated by Cotgrave, the presence-chambre, and
  <i>lit de parement</i>, a bed of state. <i>Parements</i> originally
  signified all sorts of ornamental furniture or clothes, from Fr.
  <i>parer</i>, to adorn. See Kn. Ta. 1643 (A. 2501), and Legend of Good
  Women; Dido, l. 181.' He adds that the Italians use <i>camera de'
  paramenti</i> in the same sense.</p>

  <p>272. <i>Venus children</i>, the worshippers or subjects, of Venus. It
  merely means the knights and ladies at the feast, whose thoughts then
  turned upon love, because the season was astrologically favourable for
  it; cf. Kn. Tale, 1628, 1629 (A. 2486). The reason is given in l. 273,
  viz. that 'hir lady,' i.&nbsp;e. <i>their</i> lady or goddess, as represented
  by the planet Venus, was then situate in the sign Pisces. This sign, in
  astrology, is called the 'exaltation' of Venus, or the sign in which she
  exerts most power. Hence the expression <i>ful hye</i>, and the statement
  that Venus regarded her servants with a friendly aspect. In the Wyf of
  Bathes Prol. (D. 704), Chaucer has the line&mdash;</p>

  of Arimathea, ed. Skeat, note to l. 698. And see vol. ii. 506.</p>

  <p>300. <i>Hath</i> is here used like the mod. F. <i>il y a</i>, for
  which O. F. often has <i>a</i> only. The sense is&mdash;'there is
  plenty.' The idiom is borrowed from French, and the text is correct. (I
  owe this note to a friend.)</p>

  <p>352. By the old physicians, blood was supposed to be in domination, or
  chief power, for seven hours, from the ninth hour of the night (beginning
  at 8 <span class="sm">P. M.</span>) to the third hour of the day.
  Tyrwhitt quotes from a book De Natura, ascribed to Galen, tom. v. p.
  327&mdash;'<i>Sanguis dominatur</i> horis septem, ab hora noctis nona ad
  horam diei tertiam.' Other authorities were pleased to state the matter
  somewhat differently. 'Six houres after midnight bloud hath the mastery,
  and in the sixe houres afore noon choler reigneth, and six houres after
  noon raigneth melancholy, and six hours afore midnight reigneth the
  flegmatick'; Shepheardes Kalender, ed. 1656, ch. xxix. Chaucer no doubt
  followed this latter account, which he may have found in the original
  French Calendrier des Bergers; see note to l. 51, p. 373.</p>

  <p>358. <i>fumositee</i>, fumes arising from wine-drinking. See C. 567;
  and concerning dreams, see the Nonne Prestes Tale, 103-149 (B.
  4113-59).</p>

  <p>359. <i>no charge</i>, no weight; to which no weight, or no
  significance, can be attached.</p>

  <p>360. <i>pryme large</i>; probably the same as <i>fully pryme</i>, Sir
  Thop., B. 2015, which see. It must then mean the time when the period of
  prime was quite ended; i.&nbsp;e. 9 <span class="sm">A. M.</span> This would
  be a very late hour for rising, but the occasion was exceptional.</p>

  <p>365. <i>appalled</i>, enfeebled, languid; lit. 'rendered pallid,' cf.

  <p>374. <i>maistresse</i>, governess; as appears from the Phis. Tale, C.
  72.</p>

  <p>376-377. Though the sense is clear, the grammar is incurably wrong.
  Chaucer <i>says</i>&mdash;'These old women, that would fain seem wise,
  just as did her governess, answered her at once.' What he <i>means</i>
  is&mdash;'This governess, that would fain seem wise, as such old women
  often do, answered her,' &amp;c. The second part of this tale seems to
  have been hastily composed, left unfinished, and never revised. Cf. l.
  382.</p>

  <p>383. <i>wel a ten</i>, i.&nbsp;e. about ten. Cf. Prol. l. 24.</p>

  <p>386. <i>four.</i> The Harl. MS. wrongly has <i>ten</i>. There is no
  doubt about it, because on March 15, the day before, the sun was in the
  <i>third</i> degree of the sign; on the 16th, he was in the <i>fourth</i>
  degree.</p>

  <p>387. It means&mdash;'and, moreover, the sun had risen but four degrees
  above the horizon'; i.&nbsp;e. it was not yet a quarter past six.</p>

  <p>396. <i>her hertes</i>, their hearts. <i>lighte</i>, to feel light, to
  feel happy; an unusual use of the verb; but see F. 914. In l. 398, the
  sudden change to the singular <i>she</i> is harsh.</p>

  <p>401. Again hastily written. Chaucer says&mdash;'The point for which
  every tale is told&mdash;if it be delayed till the pleasure of them that
  have <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page383"></a>[383]</span>hearkened after (or listened attentively
  to) the former part of it grows cold&mdash;then the pleasantness of it
  passes off, on account of the prolixity in telling it; and the more so,
  the longer it is spun out.' <i>Knotte</i> is cognate with the Lat.
  <i>nodus</i> (written for <i>gnodus</i>), as used by Horace, Ars Poet. l.
  191.</p>

  <p>409. <i>fordrye</i>, exceedingly dry. The tree was white too, owing to
  loss of its bark. This reminds me of the famous <i>Arbre Sec</i>, or Dry
  Tree; see Marco Polo, ed. Yule, i. 119; Maundeville, ed. Halliwell, p.
  68; Mätzner, Sprachproben, ii. 185.</p>

  <p>428. <i>faucon peregryn.</i> 'This species of falcon is thus described
  in the Tresor de Brunet Latin, P. i. ch. <i>Des Faucons</i>; MS. Reg. 19
  C. x. "La seconde lignie est <i>faucons</i>, qui hom apele
  <i>pelerins</i>, par ce que nus ne trove son ni; ains est pris autresi
  come en <i>pelerinage</i>, et est mult legiers a norrir, et mult cortois
  et vaillans, et de bone maniere" [i.&nbsp;e. the second kind is the falcon
  which is called the pilgrim (or peregrine), because no one ever finds its
  nest; but it is otherwise taken, as it were on <i>pilgrimage</i>, and is
  very easily fed, and very tame and bold, and well-mannered]. Chaucer adds
  that this falcon was of <i>fremde lond</i>, i.&nbsp;e. from a foreign
  country.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt.</p>

  <p>435. <i>ledene</i>, language; from A. S. <i>læden</i>, <i>leden</i>,
  sometimes used in the sense of language, though it is, after all, a mere
  corruption of <i>Latin</i>, which is the sense which it most often bears.
  Thus, the inscription on the cross of Christ is said to have been written
  'Ebreisceon stafon, and Grecisceon, and <i>Leden</i> stafon,' in Hebrew
  letters and in Greek and Latin letters; John, xix. 20. So also 'on
  <i>Ledenisc</i> gereorde,' in the Latin language; Beda, bk. iv. c. 1.
  Hence the word was used more generally in the sense of language; as,
  'Mara is, on ure <i>lyden</i>, biternes,' i.&nbsp;e. Marah is, in our speech,
  bitterness; Exod. xv. 23. This extension of the meaning, and the form of
  the word, were both influenced, probably, by confusion with the sb.
  <i>l&#x113;od</i>, people. The student should learn to distinguish this
  word from the A.&nbsp;S. <i>l&#x113;oð</i>, G. <i>lied</i>, a song. Tyrwhitt
  notes that Dante uses <i>latino</i> in the sense of language; 'E cantine
  gli augelli Ciascuno in suo <i>latino</i>'; Canzone 1.</p>

  <p>458. <i>as dooth</i>, so do, pray do. See Note to Cler. Tale, E.
  7.</p>

  <p>469. 'As verily as may the great God of nature help me.' <i>Wisly</i>,
  verily, is quite different from <i>wysly</i>, wisely; cf. Kn. Ta. 1376
  (A. 2234).</p>

  <p>471. 'To heal your hurts with quickly.' Note the position of
  <i>with</i>; and cf. l. 641.</p>

  <p>474. <i>aswowne</i> = <i>a swowne</i> = <i>on swoune</i>, in a
  swoon.</p>

  <p>479. Chaucer's favourite line; he repeats it four times. See Kn. Ta.
  903 (A. 1761); March. Ta. 9860 (E. 1986); Prol. to Leg. G. W. 503. Also,
  in The Man of Lawes Ta. B. 660, we have it again in the form&mdash;'As
  gentil herte is fulfild of pitee.'</p>

  <p>480. <i>similitude</i> is pronounced nearly as <i>sim'litude</i>.</p>

  <p>483. <i>kytheth</i>, manifests. Cf. Rom. Rose, 2187-2238 (vol. i. p.
  172).</p>

  <p>490. 'And to make others take heed by my example, as the lion is <!--
  Page 384 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page384"></a>[384]</span>chastised (or reproved) by means of the
  dog.' The explanation of this passage was a complete riddle to me till I
  fortunately discovered the proverb alluded to. It appears in George
  Herbert's Jacula Prudentum (Herbert's Works, ed. Willmott, 1859, p. 328)
  in the form 'Beat the dog before the lion,' where <i>before</i> means
  <i>in the sight of</i>. This is cleared up by Cotgrave, who, in his
  French Dictionary, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Batre</i>, has the proverb&mdash;'Batre le
  chien devant le Lion, to punish a mean person in the presence, and to the
  terror of, a great one.' It is even better explained by Shakespeare,
  Othello, ii. 3. 272&mdash;'What, man! there are ways to recover the
  general again: you are but now cast in his mood, <i>a punishment more in
  policy than in malice</i>; even so as one would beat his offenceless dog
  to affright an imperious lion.'</p>

  <p>499. <i>Ther</i>, where. The numerous expressions in this narrative
  certainly shew that the falcon was really a princess (cf. l. 559) who had
  been changed into a falcon for a time, as is so common in the Arabian
  Tales. Thus, in l. 500, the <i>roche</i> or rock may be taken to signify
  a palace, and the <i>tercelet</i> (l. 504) to be a prince. This gives the
  whole story a human interest.</p>

  <p>505-506. <i>welle</i>, well, fountain. <i>Al were he</i>, although he
  was.</p>

  <p>511. <i>coloures</i>, colours; and, in a secondary sense, pretences,
  which meaning is also intended; cf. l. 560. On dyeing <i>in grain</i>,
  i.&nbsp;e. of a fast colour, see note to Sir Thopas, B. 1917.</p>

  <p>512. <i>hit him</i>, hideth himself. The allusion is to the well-known
  lines 'Qui legitis flores ... fugite hinc, latet anguis in herba'; Verg.
  Bucol. iii. 92. Cf. D. 1994; and Macbeth, i. 5. 66.</p>

  <p>516. Read <i>k&#x113;p'th</i>. MS. Hl. gives lines 514-6
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Right so this god of loue, this ypocrite,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>517. <i>sowneth in-to</i>, tend to, are consonant with; see Prol.
  307.</p>

  <p>518. Cf. P. Plowm. B. xv. 109. Both passages are from Matt. xxiii.
  27.</p>

  <p>537. Chaucer clearly quotes this as a proverb; <i>true</i> man means
  <i>honest</i> man, according to Dogberry; Much Ado about Nothing, iii. 3.
  54. The sense seems to be much the same as 'You cannot make a silk purse
  of a sow's ear,' or 'Once a knave, always a knave.' Compare the use of
  <i>theef</i> in Anelida, l. 161; also&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Alas! I see a serpent or a theef,</p>

      <p style="margin-left:8.2em">Knightes Tale, 467 (A. 1325).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>548. The reading <i>Troilus</i> (in E. Hn.) must be a mistake, because
  he was not guilty of transferring his love to another; it was
  <i>Cressida</i> who did that, so that the falcon would take care not to
  refer to that story. Paris deserted Oenone for Helen, and Jason deserted
  Medea for Glauce. Lamech was the first to have two wives, viz. Adah and
  Ziilah; <!-- Page 385 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page385"></a>[385]</span>Gen. iv. 23. The whole of this passage is
  a recast of Chaucer's earlier poem of Anelida, where Lamech is introduced
  just in the same way (l. 150).</p>

  <p>555. Imitated, but not with good taste, from Mark, i. 7.</p>

  <p>558. This line resembles Troil. ii. 637.</p>

  <p>579. 'Whether it was a grief to me, does not admit of doubt.'</p>

  <p>583. 'Such grief I felt because he could not stay.'</p>

  <p>593. Chaucer has this expression again, Kn. Ta. 2184 (A. 3042);
  Troilus, iv. 1586. It was a common proverb. Shakespeare has it
  frequently; Two G. of Ver. iv. i. 62; Rich. II., i. 3. 278; King Lear,
  iii. 2. 70. An early example of it is in Matt. Paris (Record Series), i.
  20:&mdash;'Vitam in tantam sanctitatem commutavit, faciendo de
  necessitate virtutem,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>596. <i>to borwe</i>, for a security; <i>borwe</i> being a sb., not a
  verb. Cf. Kn. Ta. 360, 764 (A. 1218, 1622). Hence it means, 'Saint John
  being for a security,' i.&nbsp;e. Saint John being my security; as in The
  Complaint of Mars, l. 9. She pledges herself by Saint John, the apostle
  of truth; see 1 John, iii. 19, iv. 20. Lydgate has 'seint John to borowe'
  in his Complaint of the Black Knight, st. 2.</p>

  <p>601. 'When he has well <i>said</i> everything, he has done (all he
  means to do).'</p>

  <p>602. This is a common proverb; cf. Com. of Errors, iv. 3. 64; Tempest,
  ii. 2. 103; Marlowe, Jew of Malta, iii. 4.</p>

  <p>607. From Boethius, De Cons. Phil. lib. iii. met. 2:&mdash;</p>

  <p>A few lines above is a passage answering to ll. 611-620, which in the
  original runs thus (cf. vol. ii. p. 56):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>Chaucer repeats the example yet a third time, in the Manciple's Tale,
  H. 163. Moreover, Jean de Meun copied the whole passage in Le Roman de la
  Rose, 14145.</p>

  <p>617-1223. Eight leaves are here lost in MS. Hl.</p>

  <p>618. <i>newefangel</i>, i.&nbsp;e. eager for novelty; of four syllables, as
  in l. 89 of the Manc. Tale, H. 193. The word <i>newefangelnesse</i> will
  be found in the poem of Anelida, l. 141, and in Leg. of Good Wom., Prol.

      <p>As dooth the <i>tydif</i>, for newfangelnesse,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Drayton uses <i>tydy</i> as the name of a small bird, Polyolb. xiii.
  79; <i>not</i> the wren, which is mentioned five lines above. In a piece
  called The Parlament of Byrdes, pr. for A. Kytson, one of the birds is
  called a <i>tytyfer</i>; see Hazlitt's Early Pop. Poetry, iii. 177.
  Schmeller gives <i>Zitzerl</i> as the Bavarian name for a wren; but cf.
  E. <i>tit</i>.</p>

  <p>649-650. These lines are transposed in Tyrwhitt's edition. Such a
  transposition makes the sense much clearer, beyond doubt. But I am not
  convinced that the confused construction in the text is not Chaucer's
  own. It is very like his manner. Cf. notes to ll. 376, 401.</p>

  <p>667. Observe that <i>Cambalo</i>, if not inserted here in the MSS. by
  error, is quite a different person from the <i>Cambalus</i> in l. 656
  (called <i>Cambalo</i> in l. 31). He is Canace's <i>lover</i>, who is to
  fight in the lists <i>against</i> her brothers Cambalo and Algarsif, and
  win her. Spenser (F. Q. iv. 3) introduces three brethren as suitors for
  Canace, who have to fight against Cambello her brother; this is certainly
  not what Chaucer intended, nor is it very satisfactory.</p>

  <p>671-672. Some suppose these two lines to be spurious. I believe them
  to be genuine; for they occur in MS. E. Hn. Cp. Pt., and others, and are
  not to be too lightly rejected. The Lansdowne MS. has <i>eight</i> lines
  here, which are certainly spurious. In MS. E., <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'atfer'."
  >after</span> l. 672, the rest of the page is <i>blank</i>. The lines are
  quite intelligible, if we add the words <i>He entreth</i>. We then
  have&mdash;'Apollo (the sun) whirls up his chariot so highly (continues
  his course in the zodiac) till he enters the <!-- Page 387 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>[387]</span>mansion of the god
  Mercury, the cunning one'; the construction in the last line being
  similar to that in l. 209. The sun was described as in Aries, l. 51. By
  continuing his <i>upward</i> course, i.&nbsp;e. his <i>Northward</i> course,
  by which he approached the zenith daily, he would soon come to the sign
  Gemini, which was the mansion of Mercury. It is a truly Chaucerian way of
  saying that two months had elapsed. We may conclude that Chaucer just
  began the Third Part of this Tale, but never even finished the first
  sentence. It is worth noting that these two lines are imitated at the
  beginning of the (spurious) poem called The Flower and the Leaf; and in
  Skelton's Garland of Laurel, l. 1471.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Words of the Franklin.</b></p>

  <p>675. <i>youthe</i> is a dissyllable; observe the rime with <i>allow

  <p>As to the existence of early Breton Lays, a fact which Ritson rashly
  denied in his anxiety to blame Warton (see Ritson, Met. Rom. iii. 332),
  the reader may consult Price's remarks in the latest edition of Warton,
  1871, vol. i. 169-177. It cannot be doubted that the Lais of Marie de
  France were, in a large measure, founded upon Breton tales which she had
  heard or found recorded. Sir F. Madden refers us, for further
  information, to De la Rue's Essais sur les Bardes, &amp;c., iii. 47-100;
  Robert, Fables Inédites, &amp;c., i. clii-clix.; the Preface to Roman du
  Rénart; and Costello's Specimens of the Early Poetry of France, 43-49.

  quoting a part of the first three lines of the Prologus to the Satires of
  Persius.</p>

  <p>722. <i>Cithero</i>, Cicero; spelt <i>Scithero</i> in E. Hn., but
  <i>Cithero</i> in Cp. Pt. Ln. The three latter MSS. stupidly insert
  <i>ne</i> before <i>Cithero</i>, thus destroying both sense and metre,
  and tempting Mr. Wright to make the purely gratuitous suggestion, that
  Chaucer did it on purpose (!), in order to make the Frankeleyn appear
  really ignorant.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Frankeleyns Tale.</b></p>

  <p>729. <i>Armorik</i>, Armorica, the modern Brittany.</p>

  <p>743. A note in Bell says this is meant 'ironically.' On the contrary,
  it is explanatory, and in perfect keeping with the context. Cf. l. 751,
  and the full discussion of the matter in ll. 764-790.</p>

  <p>764. This passage is clearly founded on Le Roman de la Rose, ll.
  9465-9534, a piece which is too long to be quoted. Compare, for example,
  ll. 9479-9482:&mdash;</p>

  <p>774. So in P. Plowman, C. xvi. 138, we find <i>patientes uincunt</i>.
  The reference is to Dionysius Cato, Distichorum lib. i. 38:&mdash;</p>

  <p>And again, in his Breves Sententiae, Sent. xl., he
  has:&mdash;'Parentes patientia uince.' But Chaucer's words agree still
  more closely with an altered version of Cato which is quoted in Old Eng.
  Homilies, ed. Morris, 2 Ser. p. 80, in the form:&mdash;'Quem superare
  <i>nequis</i>, <i>patienter</i> uince ferendo.' Compare the
  proverb&mdash;'uincit qui patitur'; also Vergil, Æn. v. 710; Ovid, Art.

  <p>801. Penmarch Point is a headland near Quimper, in the department of
  Finisterre; a little to the S. of Brest.</p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt's derivation of this name, from <i>pen</i>, a head, and
  <i>mark</i>, a mark or boundary, assumes that <i>mark</i> is a Celtic
  word. No doubt <i>pen</i> represents Bret. <i>penn</i> (Welsh
  <i>pen</i>), a head, a promontory; but, instead of <i>mark</i> I can only
  find Bret. <i>march</i> (Welsh and Cornish <i>march</i>, Irish
  <i>marc</i>), a horse. In the sense of boundary, <i>mark</i> is Teutonic.
  <!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page389"></a>[389]</span></p>

  <p>808. <i>Kayrrud</i>, Caer-rud; evidently an old Celtic name.
  <i>Caer</i> is the Bret. <i>ker</i>, <i>kear</i>, a town; Welsh and
  Cornish <i>caer</i>, a fort, town. And perhaps <i>rud</i> is 'red'; cf.
  Bret. <i>ruz</i>, Welsh <i>rhudd</i>, Cornish <i>rudh</i>, red. It does
  not appear in the map.</p>

  <p><i>Arveragus</i>, a Latinised form of a Celtic name; spelt
  <i>Aruiragus</i> in Juvenal, Sat. iv. 127. Arviragus, son of Cymbeline,
  one of the fabulous kings of Britain, married a daughter of the Roman
  emperor Claudius; see Rob. of Glouc. l. 1450.</p>

  <p>815. <i>Dorigene</i>; also a Celtic name. 'Droguen, or Dorguen, was
  the wife of Alain I.&mdash;Lobineau, t. i. p. 70.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt.
  Lobineau was the author of a history of Brittany.</p>

  <p>830. Cf. 'Gutta cauat lapidem'; Ovid, Epist. iv. 10. 5.</p>

  <p>861. Cf. 'That she ne hath foot on which she may sustene'; Anelida,
  177.</p>

  <p>867. <i>In ydel</i>, in vain. In P. Plowman, A. vi. 61, we have <i>in
  idel</i>, and in B. v. 580, <i>an ydel</i>, in the same sense. With this
  passage, cf. Boeth. bk. i. met. 5. 22; bk. iii. met. 9. 1-10.</p>

  <p>879. Cf. 'a fayr party of so grete a werk'; Boeth. bk. i. met. 5.
  38.</p>

  <p>880. <i>thyn owene merk</i>, thine own likeness; cf. 'ad imaginem
  suam,' Gen. i. 27. It appears, from P. Plowman, B. xv. 343, C. xviii. 73,
  that the words <i>merke</i> and <i>preynte</i> (print) were both used of
  the 'impression' upon a coin. From a comparison of the Vulgate version of
  Gen. i. 27 and Matt. xxii. 20, we see that <i>imago</i> was used in the
  same way. This explains how <i>merk</i> came to mean 'likeness,' and how
  <i>mark of Adam</i> (in D. 696) came to mean 'all such as are made in
  Adam's likeness.' See that passage.</p>

  <p>883. <i>menes</i>, means, instruments of Thy will. The sing.
  <i>mene</i>, in the same sense, occurs in P. Plowman, C. xvii. 96, and
  frequently in Sir Generides, where it is spelt <i>meane</i>.</p>

  <p>886. 'All's for the best'; a popular rendering of Romans, viii. 28.
  Cf. Boeth. bk. iv. pr. 6. 194-6.</p>

  <p>889. <i>this</i>, short for <i>this is</i>; as in many other
  places.</p>

  <p>899. <i>delitables</i>, a good example of a French pl. adj. in
  <i>s</i>. So also <i>royales</i>, B. 2038. See my note to P. Plowman, C.
  x. 342.</p>

  <p>900. <i>ches</i>, chess. Chess was played in England even before the
  Conquest, in the days of Canute. 'Tables' is another name for backgammon,
  and was called <i>tabularum ludus</i> in Latin. See Strutt's Sports and
  Pastimes, bk. iv. c. 2. §§ 4, 16.</p>

  <p>913. <i>The odour</i> is to be read as <i>Th'odóur</i>.</p>

  <p>918. <i>At-after</i>, after; as in F. 302.</p>

  <p>938. <i>Aurelius.</i> Tyrwhitt remarks that 'this name, though of
  Roman origin, was common, we may presume, among the Britons. One of the
  princes mentioned by Gildas was called <i>Aurelius Conanus</i>. Another
  British king is called <i>Aurelius Ambrosius</i> by Geoffrey of
  Monmouth.' See Fabyan's History, pt. 1. capp. 93, 108.</p>

  <p>942. <i>With-outen coppe</i>, without a cup. This expression means
  that he drank his penance in full measure, not by small quantities <!--
  Page 390 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page390"></a>[390]</span>at a
  time. It occurs again in the Prologue to the Tale of Beryn, ll. 306,
  460.</p>

  <p>948. Chaucer wrote such things himself; see Leg. of Good Women, 423,
  and the note. See also, in his Minor Poems, the Complaint of Mars, the
  roundel in the Parl. of Foules, 680; and the exquisite triple roundel
  called Merciles Beautè.</p>

  <p>950. The syllables <i>as a fu-</i> form the third foot. Some MSS. have
  <i>fuyre</i>, i.&nbsp;e. fire (see the footnote); but hell is not the place
  where fire was supposed to languish. The reading <i>furye</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
  fury, also presents some difficulty, but we must take <i>languish</i> to
  mean 'endure continual pain.' This precisely agrees with Chaucer's
  language in Troilus, iv. 22-24.</p>

  <p>We have already had a confusion between <i>fury</i> and <i>fire</i> in
  A. 2684. The reading <i>furie</i> is perfectly established by help of F.
  448 (this <i>furial</i> pyne of <i>helle</i>), and by further comparing
  l. 1101 below.</p>

  <p>951. <i>Ekko</i>, Echo. So in the Book of the Duch. 735. Chaucer
  probably took this from Le Rom. de la Rose, 1447; see the English
  version, ll. 1469-1538. But he had learnt, by this time, that the true
  original was Ovid (Metamorph. iii. 407). Hence the side-note in MS.
  E.&mdash;'Methamorposios'&mdash;(<i>sic</i>).</p>

  <p>963. <i>And hadde</i>, and <i>she</i> had; with a sudden change of
  subject.</p>

  <p>974. <i>Madame</i> is here trisyllabic; in l. 967, the last syllable
  is very light.</p>

  <p>982. The <i>-ie</i> in <i>Aurelie</i> is slurred over; <i>know-e</i>
  is dissyllabic. Cf. l. 989.</p>

  <p>992. <i>Lok-e</i>, for <i>Lok-en</i>, imper. <i>plural</i>.</p>

  <p>993. The first foot contains <i>Ye remoe-</i>; and the final <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i> of <i>remoev-e</i> is not cut off. Otherwise,
  place an accent on the syllable <i>re-</i>.</p>

  <p>999-1000. These two lines are placed lower down in Tyrwhitt's edition,
  after l. 1006, on the authority of three inferior MSS., viz. Harl. 7335,
  Harl. 7333, and Barlow 20. But the old editions agree with the best MSS.,
  and nothing is gained by the change.</p>

  <p>1018. A humorous apology for a poetical expression.</p>

  <p>1031. A side-note in E. has&mdash;'The compleint of Aurelius to the
  goddes and to the sonne.'</p>

  <p>1033. <i>after</i>, i.&nbsp;e. according to. The change of seasons depends
  on the sun's change of declination, which causes his position (called
  <i>herberwe</i> or 'harbour' in l. 1035) to be high or low in the sky.
  See note to l. 1058.</p>

  <p>1045. In MS. E., <i>Lucina</i> is glossed by 'luna,' i.&nbsp;e. the moon;
  see A. 2085.</p>

  <p>1049. Read <i>knowen</i> as <i>know'n</i>. All the six MSS. keep the
  final <i>n</i>; but Cp. Pt. Ln. drop the word <i>that</i>.</p>

  <p>1054. <i>more and lesse</i>, greater and smaller, i.&nbsp;e. rivers.</p>

  <p>1058. <i>Leoun</i>, the sign Leo. In l. 906, May 6 is mentioned, and
  the events recorded in ll. 906-1016 all belong to this day. Ll. 1019-1081
  belong to the evening of the same day. But, in May, the sun is in <!--
  Page 391 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page391"></a>[391]</span>Taurus, and the moon, when in opposition,
  would be in the <i>opposite</i> sign, which is Scorpio; and we should
  expect the reading&mdash;'of Scorpioun.' As it stands, the text
  means:&mdash;'at the next opposition that takes place with the sun in
  Leo'; i.&nbsp;e. not at the <i>very</i> next opposition, with the sun in
  Taurus; nor yet after that, with the sun in Gemini or Cancer. The reason
  for the delay is astrological; for Leo was the <i>mansion</i> of the Sun,
  so that the sun's power would then be greatest; besides which, the sign
  Leo greatly increased a planet's influence; see A. 2462, and the
  note.</p>

  <p>We may notice the various allusions in the above lines. In l. 1033,
  the sun's declination changes from day to day, and with it the solar
  power and heat; so that the vegetable kingdom fails or grows according as
  the sun's 'harbour,' or position in the ecliptic, causes his meridian
  altitude to be low or high (l. 1035). In l. 1046, the power of the moon
  over the tides is mentioned; and, in l. 1050, the dependence of lunar
  upon solar light. The highest tides occur when the sun and moon are
  either in conjunction or opposition; the latter is here fixed upon. If,
  says Aurelius, the sun and moon could always <i>remain</i> in opposition,
  viz. by moving at the same apparent rate (l. 1066), the moon would always
  remain at the full (l. 1069), and the spring-flood, or highest flood,
  would last all the while (l. 1070).</p>

  <p>1074. Here Luna is identified with Proserpina; see note to A. 2051,
  where I have quoted the sentence&mdash;'Diana, quae et <i>Luna,
  Proserpina</i>, Hecate nuncupatur.' And see the parallel lines in A.
  2081-2.</p>

  <p>1077. <i>Delphos</i>, Delphi; Chaucer adopts, as usual, the accusative
  form. Ovid has <i>Delphi</i>, Met. x. 168; <i>Delphica templa</i>, Met.
  xi. 414.</p>

  <p>1086. 'Let him choose, as far as I am concerned, whether he wishes to
  live or die.' <i>whether</i> is here cut down to <i>whe'r</i>, as
  frequently.</p>

  <p>1088. Cf. 'And in his host of chivalrye the flour'; A. 982.</p>

  <p>1094-1096. <i>imaginatyf</i>, of a suspicious fancy. <i>doute</i>,
  fear.</p>

  <p>1110. This is the Pamphilus already referred to in B. 2746 (see note
  to that line). The poem relates the poet's love for Galatea. In the note
  to B. 2746, I have given the title of the poem as <i>De Amore</i>.
  Another title is&mdash;Pamphili Mauriliani Pamphilus, sive De Arte Amandi
  Elegiae. Skelton alludes to it also, and Dyce's note (in his ed. of
  Skelton, ii. 345) tells us&mdash;'It is of considerable length, and
  though written in barbarous Latin, was by some attributed to Ovid. It may
  be found in a little volume edited by Goldastus, Ovidii Nasonis
  Pelignensis Erotica et Amatoria Opuscula, &amp;c. 1610.' Tyrwhitt quotes
  the first four lines, from MS. Cotton, Titus A. xx&mdash;'Vulneror, et
  clausum porto sub pectore telum,' &amp;c. In the margin of E. is here
  written&mdash;'Pamphilus ad Galatheam,' followed by the
  line&mdash;'Vulneror ... telum.' Chaucer imitates this line in ll. 1111,
  1112. And see Lounsbury, Studies, ii. 370.</p>

  <p>1113. <i>sursanure</i>, a wound healed outwardly only. A F. word, from
  Lat. <i>super</i> and <i>sanare</i>. See <i>soursanëure</i> in
  Godefroy.</p>

  <p>1115. <i>But</i>, unless. <i>come therby</i>, get at it, get hold of
  it.</p>

  <p>1118. 'There was a celebrated and very ancient university at Orleans,
  <!-- Page 392 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page392"></a>[392]</span>which fell into disrepute as the
  university of Paris became famous; and the rivalry probably led to the
  imputation that the occult sciences were cultivated at
  Orleans.'&mdash;Wright.</p>

  <p>1121. 'In every hiding-place and corner'; cf. G. 311, 658.</p>

  <p>1130. I here quote from my Preface to Chaucer's Astrolabe (E. E. T.
  S.), p. lix. 'The twenty-eight "moon-stations" of the Arabs are given in
  Ideler's Untersuchungen über die Bedeutung der Sternnamen, p. 287. He
  gives the Arabic names, the stars that help to fix their positions,
  &amp;c. See also Mr. Brae's edition of the Astrolabe, p. 89. For the
  influence of the moon in these mansions, we must look elsewhere, viz. in
  lib. i. cap. 11, and lib. iv. cap. 18 of the Epitome Astrologiae of
  Johannes Hispalensis. Suffice it to say that there are 12 temperate
  mansions, 6 dry ones, and 10 moist ones.' The number 28 corresponds with
  the number of days in a lunation.</p>

  <p>1132. Cf. Chaucer's remark in his Astrolabe, ii. 4.
  36&mdash;'Natheles, thise ben observauncez of iudicial matiere and rytes
  of payens, <i>in which my spirit ne hath no feith</i>.'</p>

  <p>1133. In speaking of the First Commandment, Hampole says:
  'Astronomyenes byhaldes the daye and the houre and the poynte that man es
  borne in, and vndir whylke syngne he es borne, and the poynte that he
  begynnes to be in, and by thire syngnes, and other, thay saye that that
  sall befall the man aftyrwarde; but theyre errowre es reproffede of haly
  doctours.'&mdash;Eng. Prose Treatises of Hampole, ed. Perry, p. 9. So
  also in Religious Pieces in Prose and Verse, ed. Perry, p. 5.</p>

  <p>1141. <i>tregetoures</i>, jugglers. Cf. F. 218, 219; Hous of Fame,
  1260, and my note upon the line; also the same, 1277, and my note on it.
  From O.&nbsp;F. <i>trasgeter</i>, (Prov. <i>trasgitar</i>), answering to a Low
  Lat. <i>transiectare</i>, i.&nbsp;e. to throw across, cause to pass. Thus the
  original sense of <i>tregetour</i> was one who caused rapid changes, by
  help of some mechanical contrivance. See Marco Polo, ed. Yule, i. 342;
  and note 9 to Bk. i. c. 61; Cornelius Agrippa, on Juggling; Ritson, Anc.
  Met. Romances, vol. i. p. ccv; and the verses on the Tregetour in
  Lydgate's Dance of Machabre. <i>Treget</i> means imposture, juggling,
  deceit, in the E. version of the Romaunt of the Rose, 6267, 6312, 6825;
  and <i>tregetrie</i> means the same, 6374, 6382. (Not allied to
  <i>trebuchet</i>, as suggested by Tyrwhitt.)</p>

  <p>1180. <i>dawes</i>, days; variant of <i>dayes</i>. The pl.
  <i>dawes</i> occurs here only; but <i>dayes</i> rimes with <i>layes</i>
  in l. 709 above, with <i>delayes</i> in l. 1293 below, and (in the phr.
  <i>now a dayes</i>) with <i>Iayes</i>, G. 1396, and <i>assayes</i>, E.
  1164. Chaucer also has <i>dawe</i>, v., to dawn, riming with
  <i>felawe</i>, A. 4250, and <i>awe</i>, B. 3872. The variant <i>dawes</i>
  is due to the A.&nbsp;S. <i>dagas</i>, where the <i>g</i> is followed, not by
  <i>e</i>, but by <i>a</i>; hence we only find it in the plural. But it is
  not uncommon; it occurs in St. Brandan, ed. Wright, p. 5, l. 3; Havelok,
  2344; King Alisaunder, ed. Weber, l. 1436; Gower, Conf. Am. ii. 113,
  where it rimes with <i>sawes</i>; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1204. The use of <i>our</i> is graphic; it occurs in all six MSS.
  Tyrwhitt has <i>the</i>.</p>

  <p>1222. <i>Gerounde</i>, the river Gironde; <i>Sayne</i>, the Seine.
  That is, all <!-- Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page393"></a>[393]</span>the S.W. coast from the Gironde to Brest,
  and all the N.W. coast from Brest to Honfleur; thus including much more
  than just the W. promontory.</p>

  <p>1224. Here ceases the gap in Hl., F. 617-1223.</p>

  <p>1241. Accent <i>mágicién</i> on the first and last syllables.</p>

  <p>1245. 'The sun grew old, and his hue was like that of latten.' For
  <i>latoun</i>, later <i>latten</i>, see note to C. 350. That is, the sun
  had a dull coppery hue, as in December, when it may be said to be 'old,'
  as it was approaching the end of its annual course. Cf. <i>yonge
  sonne</i>; A. 7.</p>

  <p>1246. 'Who, when in his hot declination (i.&nbsp;e. in the sign of Cancer,
  when his northern declination was greatest) used to shine like burnished
  gold, with bright beams; but he had now arrived in Capricornus, where he
  was at his lowest altitude (i.&nbsp;e. at the winter solstice); and shone but
  dimly.'</p>

  <p>In Chaucer's time, the sun entered Capricorn on December 13; see his
  Treatise on the Astrolabe, ii. 1. 12.</p>

  <p>1252. In the margin of E. is written&mdash;'Janus biceps'; referring
  to 'Iane biceps' in Ovid's Fasti, i. 65; and 'Iane biformis,' id. l. 89.
  The allusion is to the approach of January, after the winter solstice.
  This season, as indicated in ll. 1253, 1254, is the time of Christmas and
  New-Year festivities, when wine is drunk from horns, and the boar's head
  appears at feasts. See Brand's Pop. Antiq., ed. Ellis, i. 484, for the
  carol sung at the bringing in of the boar's head as the first dish on
  Christmas day, as e.g. in the Inner Temple and at Queen's College,
  Oxford. He quotes from Dekker:&mdash;'like so many bores' heads stuck
  with branches of rosemary, to be served in <i>for brawne</i> at
  Christmas.'</p>

  <p>Skelton speaks of 'Ianus, with his double chere,' i.&nbsp;e. face; Garl. of
  Laurell, 1515. Cf. Chambers, Book of Days, i. 19; and ii. 754; Spenser,
  F.&nbsp;Q. vii. 7. 41.</p>

  <p>1255. '<i>Nowel</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. 'the birthday,' or Christmas day. From O.
  F. <i>noël</i> (Prov. <i>nadal</i>); from Lat. <i>natalem</i>. Cotgrave
  quotes a French proverb:&mdash;'Tant crie on Noël qu'il vient, So long is
  Christmas cried that at length it comes.' Littré gives, as the second
  sense of <i>Noël</i>&mdash;'Cantique en langue vulgaire, ayant
  ordinairement pour sujet la naissance de Jésus-Christ, que l'on chante à
  l'approche de la Noël.' Hence 'to cry Noël' was to sing a Christmas
  carol; as was usual on Christmas eve. He further explains that 'Noël!'
  subsequently became a cry on <i>any</i> occasion of great rejoicing; so
  that, in this way, 'to cry Noël' meant to proclaim glad tidings. Hence
  the silly confusion of the word with '<i>nouvelles</i>,' in the
  imaginative accounts of it given by some English writers.</p>

  <p>1266. Read <i>I n' can</i>; see note to A. 764.</p>

  <p>1273. 'The astronomical tables, composed by order of Alphonso X, king
  of Castile, about the middle of the thirteenth century, were called
  sometimes <i>Tabulae Toletanae</i>, from their being adapted to the city
  of Toledo. There is a very elegant copy of them in MS. Harl.
  3647.'&mdash;T. <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page394"></a>[394]</span>In Chaucer's Astrolabe, ii. 44. 16, we
  find:&mdash;'And if hit so be that hit [i.&nbsp;e. the time for which the
  change in a planet's position is being reckoned] passe 20 [years],
  consider wel that fro 1 to 20 ben <i>anni expansi</i>, and fro 20 to
  3,000 ben <i>anni collecti</i>.' The changes in position of the various
  planets were obtained from these tables. The quantities denoting the
  amount of a planet's motion during <i>round periods</i> of years, such as
  twenty, forty, or sixty years, were entered in a table headed <i>Anni
  collecti</i>. Similar quantities for lesser periods, from one year up to
  twenty years, were entered under the headings 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.; and such
  years were called <i>Anni expansi</i>, i.&nbsp;e. single or separate years.
  See Ptolemy's Almagest, lib. vi. and lib. ix.; and the note in vol. iii.
  p. 367.</p>

  <p>1276. <i>rotes</i>, roots. The 'root' is the tabulated quantity
  belonging to a given fixed date or era, from which corresponding
  quantities can be calculated by addition or subtraction. Thus the
  longitude of a planet at a given date is the 'root'; and its longitude at
  another date, say twenty-three years later, can be obtained from the
  Toletan tables by adding (1) its change of longitude in twenty years, as
  given in the table of <i>Anni collecti</i>, and (2) its further change in
  three years, as given in the table of <i>Anni expansi</i>. Chaucer uses
  the term 'root' again in B. 314; and in his Astrolabe, ii. 44. 1;
  q.v.</p>

  <p>1277. 'Centre' was a technical name for the end of the small brass
  projection on the 'rete' of an astrolabe which denoted the position of a
  fixed star (usually of the first magnitude). See Chaucer's Astrolabe,
  Fig. 2 (in vol. iii.); and <i>Centre</i> in the Glossary. 'Argument' is
  an astronomical term still in use, and means 'the angle, arc, or other
  mathematical quantity, from which another required quantity may be
  deduced, or on which its calculation depends'; New Eng. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>In Chaucer's Astrolabe, § 44 of Part II. is headed&mdash;'Another
  maner conclusion, to knowe the mene mote and the <i>argumentis</i> of any
  planete.'</p>

  <p>1278. <i>proporcionels convenients</i>, fitting proportionals;
  referring to a table of 'proportional parts,' by which fractional parts
  of a year can be taken into consideration, in calculating the motions of
  the planets.</p>

  <p>1279. <i>equacions</i>, equations; probably here used in the sense of
  'exact quantities.' Thus the 'exact quantity' of a planet's motion,
  during a given time, can be obtained by adding together the motion during
  the 'collect' years, the 'expanse' years, and the fraction of a year; see
  the last note.</p>

  <p>1280. <i>eighte spere</i>, eighth sphere; cf. 'ninthe speere' in l.
  1283. In the old astronomy (as explained more fully in the note to B.
  295), there were nine imaginary spheres, viz. the seven spheres of the
  seven planets, the eighth sphere or sphere of fixed stars (supposed to
  have a slow motion from west to east about the poles of the zodiac, to
  account for the precession of the equinoxes), and the ninth sphere or
  <i>primum mobile</i>, which had a diurnal motion from east to west, and
  carried <!-- Page 395 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page395"></a>[395]</span>everything with it. <i>Alnath</i> is still
  a name for the bright star <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> Arietis, of
  the first magnitude, which was necessarily situate in the eighth sphere.
  But the head of the <i>fixed</i> Aries, or the true equinoctial point,
  was in the ninth sphere above it.</p>

  <p>The exact amount of the precession of the equinoxes (which is what
  Chaucer here alludes to) could be ascertained by observing, from time to
  time, the distance between the true equinoctial point and the star
  Alnath, which was conveniently situated for the purpose, being in the
  head of Aries. In the time of Hipparchus (<span class="sm">B.C.</span>
  150), the distance of Alnath from the true equinoctial point was but a
  few degrees; but at the present time it is 'shove,' in longitude, some
  35° from the same. (The readings <i>thre</i> for <i>eighte</i> in l.
  1280, and <i>fourthe</i> for <i>ninthe</i> in l. 1283, given by Wright
  from MS. Hl., are of course absurd).</p>

  <p>1285. <i>firste mansioun</i>, first mansion, viz. of the moon. It was
  called <i>Alnath</i>, from the star. In the margin of E. is
  written&mdash;'Alnath dicitur prima mansio lunae.' Cf. note to l. 1130;
  and see l. 1289. His object was, clearly, to calculate the moon's
  position; see l. 1287.</p>

  <p>1288. 'And knew in whose "face" the moon arose, and in what "term,"
  and all about it.' Each sign of the zodiac, containing thirty degrees,
  was divided into three equal parts, each of ten degrees, called
  <i>faces</i> in the astrological jargon of the time. Not only each
  <i>sign</i>, but each <i>face</i>, was assigned to some peculiar planet;
  hence <i>whos</i> means 'of which planet.' Besides this equal division of
  each sign, we find unequal divisions, called <i>terms</i>. For example,
  the sign Aries, considered as a whole, was called 'the mansion of Mars.'
  Again, of this sign, degrees one to ten were called 'the face of Mars';
  degrees eleven to twenty, 'the face of the Sun'; and degrees twenty-one
  to thirty, 'the face of Venus.' Lastly, of the same sign, degrees one to
  six were 'a term of Jupiter'; degrees seven to twelve, of Venus; degrees
  thirteen to twenty, of Mercury; twenty-one to twenty-five, of Mars; and
  twenty-six to thirty, of Saturn. Of course, the whole of this assignment
  was purely fanciful, imposed at first by arbitrary authority, and
  afterwards kept up by tradition. Cf. l. 1293.</p>

  <p>1311-1322. These lines form a 'Complaint,' quite in the style of the
  Compleint of Anelida, q.v. Thus, l. 1318 is like Anelida, l.
  288:&mdash;'As verily ye sleen me with the peyne.' The 'complaint' of
  Dorigen begins at l. 1355.</p>

  <p>1340. 'Other colour then asshen hath she noon'; Anelida, 173.</p>

  <p>1348. 'She wepeth, waileth, swowneth pitously'; Anelida, 169.</p>

  <p>1355. In the margin of E. is written&mdash;'The compleynt of Dorigene
  ayeyns Fortune.'</p>

  <p>1367. Tyrwhitt remarks that all these examples are taken from book i.
  of Hieronymus contra Iouinianum. In fact, this reference is expressly
  supplied in the margin of E., at l. 1465, where we find&mdash;'Singulas
  has historias et plures, hanc materiam concernentes, recitat beatus
  Ieronimus contra Iouinianum in primo suo libro, cap. 39°.' There is a
  similar note in Hn., at l. 1395. <!-- Page 396 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page396"></a>[396]</span></p>

  <p>On reference to Jerome, I find that the passages referred to are
  worthy of being expressly quoted, especially as Chaucer does not adhere
  to the order of the original. Moreover, most of them are quoted in the
  side-notes to E., with more or less correctness. I therefore give below
  all such as are worth giving.</p>

  <p>1368. The passage in Jerome is as follows:&mdash;'Triginta
  Atheniensium tyranni cum Phidonem in conuiuio necassent, filias eius
  uirgines ad se uenire iusserunt, et scortorum more nudari: ac super
  pauimenta, patris sanguine cruentata, impudicis gestibus ludere, quae
  paulisper dissimulato doloris habitu, cum temulentos conuiuas cernerent,
  quasi ad requisita naturae egredientes, inuicem se complexae
  praecipitauerunt in puteum, ut uirginitatem morte seruarent'; p. 48. This
  story (quoted in full in MS. E.) refers to the excesses committed in
  Athens by the Thirty Tyrants, who were overthrown by Thrasybulus, <span
  class="sm">B.C.</span> 403.</p>

  <p>1370. 'They commanded (men) to arrest his daughters.'</p>

  <p>1379. Jerome has:&mdash;'Spartiatae et Messenii diu inter se habuere
  amicitias, intantum ut ob quaedam sacra etiam uirgines ad se mutuo
  mitterent. Quodam igitur tempore, cum quinquaginta uirgines
  Lacedaemoniorum Messenii uiolare tentassent, de tanto numero ad stuprum
  nulla consensit, sed omnes libentissime pro pudicitia occubuerunt'; p.
  48. Cf. Orosius, i. 14. 1.</p>

  <p>1380. <i>Lacedomie</i>, Lacedaemonia; as in C. 605.</p>

  <p>1387. Jerome has:&mdash;'Aristoclides Orchomeni tyrannus adamauit
  uirginem Stymphalidem, quae cum patre occiso ad templum Dianae
  confugisset, et simulacrum eius teneret, nec ui posset auelli, in eodem
  loco confossa est'; p. 48. I suppose that Orchomenus is here the town so
  called in Arcadia, rather than the more famous one in Boeotia; for the
  district of Stymphalus is in Arcadia, and near Orchomenus.</p>

  <p>1399. Jerome has:&mdash;'Nam Hasdrubalis uxor capta, et incensa urbe,
  cum se cerneret a Romanis capiendam esse, apprehensis ab utroque latere
  paruulis filiis, in subiectum domus suae deuolauit incendium'; Valerius
  Maximus has a similar story, lib. iii. c. 2. ext. 8; cf. Orosius, iv. 13.
  3. Chaucer has already alluded to this story; see note to B. 4553.</p>

  <p>1402. <i>alle</i>; Valerius Maximus merely says&mdash;'dextra laeuaque
  communes filios trahens.'</p>

  <p>1405. Jerome says:&mdash;'Ad Romanas foeminas transeam, et primam
  ponam Lucretiam; quae uiolatae pudicitiae pudens superuiuere, maculam
  corporis cruore deleuit'; p. 50. In the margin of E. we
  find:&mdash;'primo ponam Lucretiam ... deleuit'; with the reading
  <i>nolens</i> for <i>pudens</i>. See also the legend of Lucretia in the
  Legend of Good Women.</p>

  <p>1409. Jerome says:&mdash;'Quis ualeat silentio praeterire septem
  Milesias uirgines, quae Gallorum impetu cuncta uastante, ne quid indecens
  ab hostibus sustinerent, turpitudinem morte fugerunt; exemplum sui
  cunctis uirginibus relinquentes, honestis mentibus magis pudicitiam curae
  esse, quam uitam'; p. 50. MS. E. quotes this as far as 'Gallorum.' As
  Miletus is in Caria, perhaps <i>Galli</i> refers here to the Gallograeci
  or Galatae. <!-- Page 397 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page397"></a>[397]</span></p>

  <p>1414. 'Xenophon in Cyri maioris scribit infantia, occiso Abradote
  uiro, quem Panthea uxor miro amore dilexerat, collocasse se iuxta corpus
  lacerum; et confosso pectore, sanguinem suum mariti infudisse
  uulneribus'; p. 50. MS. E. cites the first eight words of this, with the
  spelling <i>Abradate</i>; whence Chaucer's <i>Habradate</i>. Chaucer's
  account of Panthea's exclamation is evidently imaginary. The story is
  told at length in Xenophon's Cyropaedia, bk. vii. Abradates, king of the
  Susi, was killed in battle against the Egyptians. His wife Panthea slew
  herself with a dagger, and fell with her head upon his breast.</p>

  <p>1426. 'Demotionis Areopagitarum principis uirgo filia, audito sponsi
  Leosthenis interitu, qui bellum Lamiacum concitarat, se interfecit:
  asserens quanquam intacta esset corpore, tamen si alterum accipere
  cogeretur, quasi secundum acciperet, cum priori mente nupsisset'; p. 48.
  E. quotes the first five words of this.</p>

  <p>1428. 'Quo ore laudandae sunt Scedasi filiae in Leuctris Boeotiae,
  quas traditum est absente patre duo iuuenes praetereuntes iure hospitii
  suscepisse. Qui multum indulgentes uino, uim per noctem intulere
  uirginibus. Quae amissae pudicitiae nolentes superuiuere, mutuis
  conciderunt uulneribus'; p. 48. E. quotes the first six words, with the
  spelling <i>Cedasii</i>. The story of Scedasus (<span title="Skedasos" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&kappa;&#x1F73;&delta;&alpha;&sigma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>) and
  his daughters is told at length by Plutarch, being the third story in his
  Amatoriae Narrationes (<span title="erôtikai diêgêseis" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&rho;&omega;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;
  &delta;&iota;&eta;&gamma;&#x1F75;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;<!--
  -->&sigmaf;</span>).</p>

  <p>1432. 'Nicanor uictis Thebis atque subuersis, unius uirginis captiuae
  amore superatus est. Cuius coniugium expetens, et uoluntarios amplexus,
  quod scilicet captiua optare debuerat, sensit pudicis mentibus plus
  uirginitatem esse quàm regnum; et interfectam propria manu, flens et
  lugens amator tenuit'; p. 49. E. cites a few words of this, with the
  spelling <i>Nichanor</i>. The reference is to the taking of Thebes by
  Alexander, <span class="sm">B.C.</span> 336. Nicanor was one of his
  officers.</p>

  <p>1434. This story, in Jerome, immediately follows the
  former:&mdash;'Narrant scriptores Graeci et aliam Thebanam uirginem, quam
  hostis Macedo corruperat, dissimulasse paulisper dolorem, et uiolatorem
  uirginitatis suae iugulasse postea dormientem; seque interfecisse gladio,
  ut nec uiuere uoluerit post perditam castitatem, nec ante mori, quàm sui
  ultrix existeret.' E. quotes a few words of this.</p>

  <p>1437. Chaucer has translated here very literally. For Jerome
  has:&mdash;'Quid loquar Nicerati coniugem? quae impatiens iniuriae uiri,
  mortem sibi ipsa consciuit; ne triginta tyrannorum, quos Lysander uictis
  Athenis imposuerat, libidinem substineret'; p. 49. Compare Plutarch's
  Life of Lysander. Niceratus, son of Nicias, was put to death by the
  Thirty Tyrants, who were imposed upon Athens by Lysander, <span
  class="sm">B.C.</span> 404.</p>

  <p>1439. 'Alcibiades ille Socraticus, uictis Atheniensibus, fugit ad
  Pharnabacum [i.&nbsp;e. Pharnabazum]. Qui accepto precio à Lysandro principe
  Lacedaemoniorum, iussit eum interfici. Cumque suffocato caput esset
  ablatum, et missum Lysandro in testimonium caedis expletae, reliqua pars
  corporis iacebat insepulta. Sola igitur concubina <!-- Page 398 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page398"></a>[398]</span>contra crudelissimi
  hostis imperium inter extraneos et imminente discrimine, funeri iusta
  persoluit; mori parata pro mortuo, quem uiuum dilexerat'; pp. 49, 50. E.
  quotes the first four words. See Plutarch's Life of Alcibiades; or the
  extracts from it in my edition of 'Shakespeare's Plutarch,' p. 304. The
  woman's name was Timandra; cf. Timon of Athens, iv. 3.</p>

  <p>1442-4. Jerome says:&mdash;'Alcestin fabulae ferunt pro Admeto sponte
  defunctam, et Penelopes pudicitia Homeri carmen est'; p. 50. Quoted in
  E., with the spellings <i>Alcesten</i>, <i>Adameto</i>, and <i>Omeri</i>.
  Cf. Legend of Good Women, l. 432, and the note; also vol. iii. p.
  xxix.</p>

  <p>1445. 'Laodamia quoque poetarum ore cantatur, occiso apud Troiam
  Protesilao, noluisse superuiuere'; p. 50. E. quotes most of this, with
  the spellings <i>Lacedomia</i> and <i>Protheselao</i>. See Ovid, Heroid.
  Ep. xiii.; Hyginus, Fabula 243.</p>

  <p>1448. 'Sine Catone uiuere Martia potuit, Portia sine Bruto non
  potuit'; p. 50. Partly quoted in E. The death of Portia is told by
  Plutarch, at the very end of his Life of M. Brutus.</p>

  <p>1451. 'Artemisia quoque uxor Mausoli insignis pudicitiae fuisse
  perhibetur. Quae cum esset regina Cariae ... defunctum maritum sic semper
  amauit, ut uiuum, et mirae magnitudinis exstruxit sepulchrum; intantum,
  ut usque hodie omnia sepulchra preciosa ex nomine eius <i>Mausolaea</i>
  nuncupentur'; p. 49. E. quotes a part of this, with the spelling
  <i>Arthemesia</i>. There is an account of her in Valerius Maximus, bk.
  iv. cap. 6. ext. I. Hence comes our word <i>mausoleum</i>.</p>

  <p>1452. <i>Barbarye</i>, barbarian territory, heathendom. Cf. 'the
  Barbre nacioun'; B. 281.</p>

  <p>1453. Jerome says:&mdash;'Teuta Illyricorum regina, ut longo tempore
  uiris fortissimis imperaret, et Romanos saepe frangeret, miraculo utique
  meruit castitatis'; p. 49. Called <i>Teutana</i> by Florus, ii. 5. 2.
  Pliny says that Teuta, the queen of the Illyrians, put to death some
  Roman ambassadors; Nat. Hist. xxxiv. 6. 11.</p>

  <p>1455. Tyrwhitt omits this line and the next. Both lines appear in the
  old editions; but they are omitted in all the seven MSS. except E. They
  are certainly genuine, because the names in them are taken from Jerome,
  like the rest. E. has the spelling <i>Bilyea</i>, but I alter it to
  <i>Bilia</i> (as in the old editions) because such is Jerome's spelling.
  The story is rather a long one.</p>

  <p>'Duellius, qui primus Romae nauali certamine triumphauit, Biliam
  uirginem duxit uxorem, tantae pudicitiae, ut illo quoque seculo pro
  exemplo fuerit: quo impudicitia monstrum erat, non uitium. Is iam senex
  et trementi corpore, in quodam iurgio audiuit exprobrari sibi os
  foetidum, et tristis se domum contulit. Cumque uxori questus esset, quare
  nunquam se monuisset, ut huic uitio mederetur: Fecissem, inquit, illa,
  nisi putassem omnibus uiris sic os olere. Laudanda in utroque pudica et
  nobilis foemina, et si ignorauit uitium uiri, et si patienter tulit, et
  quod maritus infelicitatem corporis sui, non uxoris fastidio, sed
  maledicto sensit inimici'; p. 50. This Duellius or Duillius, <!-- Page
  399 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page399"></a>[399]</span>or
  Duilius, was the famous conqueror of the Carthaginians, in honour of whom
  the <i>Columna rostrata</i> was erected, to celebrate his naval victory,
  the first of that character ever gained by the Romans, <span
  class="sm">B.C.</span> 260. See Florus, Epitome, lib. ii. c. 2.</p>

  <p>Hoccleve has this story in his De Regimine Principum, ed. Wright, p.
  134. He turns <i>Bilia</i> into <i>Ulye</i>, because he got the story
  from Jacobus de Cessolis, who calls her <i>Ylia</i>.</p>

  <p>1456. Jerome says:&mdash;'Rhodogune filia Darii, post mortem uiri,
  nutricem quae illi secundas nuptias suadebat, occidit'; p. 50. According
  to Erasmus, Rhodogune is mentioned in the <i>Imagines</i> <span
  title="Eikones" class="grk"
  >&#x1F18;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F79;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span> of Flavius
  Philostratus.</p>

  <p>Again (at p. 50) Jerome says:&mdash;'Valeria, Messalarum soror, amisso
  Seruio uiro, nulli uolebat nubere. Quae interrogata cur hoc faceret, ait
  sibi semper maritum Seruium uiuere.'</p>

  <p>1457. Notwithstanding the length of Dorigene's complaint, Chaucer
  seems to have contemplated adding more examples to the list. For in the
  margin of E. is the note:&mdash;'Mem. Strato regulus. Vidi et omnes pene
  Barbares (<i>sic</i>); cap. xxvi<sup>o</sup>. primi [libri]. Item,
  Cornelia, &amp;c. Imitentur ergo nupte Theanam, Cleobiliam, Gorgun.,
  Thymodiam, Claudias atque Cornelias; in fine primi libri.' All these
  names are in Jerome, who says: 'Imitentur ergo nuptae Theano,
  Cleobulinam, Gorguntem, Timocliam, Claudias atque Cornelias'; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1470. <i>as wis</i>, as (it is) certain; cf. Ancren Riwle, p. 38;
  Ormulum, l. 2279, &amp;c. Stratmann (ed. Bradley) gives the example
  <i>also wis so he god is</i>, as surely as he is God. Of course the
  <i>i</i> is short, as <i>wis</i> rimes with <i>this</i>. Cf. A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>ge-wis</i>, <i>ge-wiss</i>, Icel. <i>viss</i>, adj., certain, sure.
  And see <i>wisly</i>, i.&nbsp;e. certainly, in l. 1475.</p>

  <p>1472. Referring to the proverb&mdash;'Let sleeping dogs lie'; or to
  one with the same sense. Cf. Troil. iii. 764.</p>

  <p>1483. <i>tel</i> is here the right form of the imperative; see l.
  1591. So in D. 1298.</p>

  <p>1493-8. Of our seven MSS., only E. contains these six lines. They are
  omitted in most modern editions, except Gilman's. But they occur, as
  Tyrwhitt pointed out, in the second edition printed by Caxton. In l.
  1496, Caxton has <i>him</i> for <i>hir</i>; which, perhaps, is
  better.</p>

  <p>1502. <i>quikkest</i>, most lively, i.&nbsp;e. most frequented.</p>

  <p>1503. <i>boun</i>, all ready, prepared; <i>as she was boun</i> implies
  that she had already set out, and was on her way. Preserved in mod. E.,
  in the form <i>bound</i>, in such phrases as 'the ship is <i>bound</i>
  for New York.' See <i>Bound</i>, pp., in the New E. Dictionary. Cf. l.
  1505.</p>

  <p>1525. <i>For which</i>, for which reason, wherefore.</p>

  <p>1529-1531. The phrases <i>him were lever</i> and <i>I have lever</i>
  are here seen to have been both in use at the same time. See, again, ll.
  1599, 1600 below.</p>

  <p>1532. <i>Than I departe</i>, than that I may part. So in all seven
  MSS. T. altered <i>I</i> to <i>to</i>.</p>

  <p>1541. 'But let every woman beware of her promise.' <!-- Page 400
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page400"></a>[400]</span></p>

  <p>1544. <i>withouten drede</i>, without doubt; as in B. 196. So also
  <i>out of drede</i>, E. 634; <i>it is no drede</i>, F. 1612.</p>

  <p>1575. <i>dayes</i>, days of respite, time to pay in by
  instalments.</p>

  <p>1580. <i>To goon a-begged</i>, to go a begging. Here <i>begged</i> is
  for <i>beggeth</i>, a sb. formed from the verb <i>to beg</i>. The
  spelling <i>gon a-beggeth</i> actually occurs twice in the Ilchester MS.
  of P. Plowman, C. ix. 138, 246. In the latter case, we even find <i>gon
  abribeth and abeggeth</i>, i.&nbsp;e. go a-robbing and a-begging. So in Rob.
  of Gloucester, l. 7710&mdash;'As he rod <i>an-honteth</i>,' as he rode
  a-hunting; and l. 9113&mdash;'he wende <i>an-honteth</i>,' he went
  a-hunting. This suffix <i><span class="nw">-eth</span></i> answers to the
  A.&nbsp;S. <i><span class="nw">-aþ</span></i> or <i><span
  class="nw">-oþ</span></i>. 'On f&#x113;awum st&#x14D;wum w&#x12B;ciaþ
  Finnas, on huntoþe on wintra, and on sumera on fiscaþe'; the Fins live in
  a few places, by hunting in winter, and by fishing in summer; Ælfred's
  tr. of Orosius, 1. 1. In M.&nbsp;E. <i><span class="nw">-eth</span></i> was
  changed to <i><span class="nw">-ed</span></i> by confusion with the
  common suffix of the pp. See also the notes to C. 406, D. 354; and to P.
  Plowm. C. ix. 138.</p>

  <p>1602. <i>apparence</i>, an illusion caused by magic.</p>

  <p>1604-5. Corruptly given in MS. Hl. (note by Wright).</p>

  <p>1614. I.&nbsp;e. 'as if you had just made your first appearance in the
  world.' An idiomatic allusion to the creeping of an insect out of the
  earth for the first time. It is obvious that there was nothing offensive

<p class="ac lg125">NOTES TO GROUP G.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Second Nonnes Tale.</b></p>

  <p>For general remarks on this Tale, see vol. iii. p. 485. Chaucer
  chiefly follows the Legenda Aurea; see note to l. 84 below, and to l. 25.
  It further appears that he consulted another Latin life of St. Cecilia,
  derived from Simeon Metaphrastes; as well as the Lives of Valerian and
  Tiburtius, in the Acta Sanctorum (April 14). See note to l. 369.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Prologue.</span> This consists of twelve stanzas, and
  is at once divisible into three parts.</p>

  <p>(1) The first four stanzas, the idea of which is taken from Jehan de
  Vignay's Introduction to his French translation of the Legenda Aurea.
  This Introduction is reprinted at length, from the Paris edition of 1513,
  in the Originals and Analogues published by the Chaucer Society, pt. ii.
  p. 190.</p>

  <p>(2) The Invocation to the Virgin, in stanzas 5-11; see note to ll. 29,
  36.</p>

  <p>(3) An Envoy to the reader, in stanza 12; see note to l. 78.</p>

  <p>Line 1. Jehan de Vignay attributes the idea of this line to St.
  Bernard. He says&mdash;'Et pour ce que oysiuete est tant blasmee que
  sainct Bernard dit qu'elle est <i>mere de truffes</i> [mother of
  trifles], marrastre de vertus: ... et fait estaindre vertu et <i>nourrir
  orgueil</i>,' &amp;c. Chaucer says again, in his Persones Tale (de
  Accidia), I. 710:&mdash;'And how that ignoraunce be moder of alle harme,
  certes, <i>necligence is the norice</i>.'</p>

  <p>2. <i>ydelnesse</i>, idleness; considered as a branch of Sloth, which
  was one of the Seven Deadly Sins. See The Persones Tale, <i>De
  Accidia</i>.</p>

  <p>3. Chaucer took this idea from the Romaunt of the Rose; see ll.
  528-594 of the English version, where a lover is described as knocking at
  the wicket of a garden, which was opened by a beautiful maiden named
  Idleness. He afterwards repeated it in the Knightes Tale, A. 1940; and
  again in the Persones Tale (de Accidia), I. 714: 'Thanne comth ydelnesse,
  that is the yate [<i>gate</i>] of alle harmes ... the hevene is yeven to
  hem that wol labouren, and nat to ydel folk.'</p>

  <p>4. <i>To eschue</i>, to eschew; the gerund. The sentence really begins
  with l. 6, after which take the words <i>to eschue</i>; then take ll.
  1-3, followed by the rest of l. 4 and by l. 5. <!-- Page 402 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page402"></a>[402]</span></p>

  <p>7. Jehan de Vignay's Introduction begins thus: 'Monseigneur sainct
  Hierosme dit ceste auctorite&mdash;"Fays tousiours aucune chose de bien,
  que le dyable ne te trouue oyseux."' That is, he refers us to St. Jerome
  for the idea. A like reference is given in the Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 206.
  We are reminded, too, of the familiar lines by Dr. Watts&mdash;</p>

  </div>

  <p>8. Cf. Persones Tale (de Accidia), I. 714:&mdash;'An ydel man is lyk
  to a place that hath no walles; the develes may entre on every syde.'</p>

  <p>10. 'Ydelnesse is the develis panter [<i>net</i>], to tempte men to
  synne'; Wyclif, Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 200.</p>

  <p>14. Cf. Pers. Tale (de Accidia), I. 689:&mdash;'Agayns this
  roten-herted sinne of accidie and slouthe sholde men exercise hemself to
  doon gode werkes'; &amp;c. 'Laborare est orare' was the famous motto of
  St. Bernard.</p>

  <p>15. <i>though men dradden never</i>, even if men never feared.</p>

  <p>17. <i>roten</i>, rotten; Wright reads <i>rote of</i>, i.&nbsp;e. root of.
  Yet his MS. has <i>roten</i>; observe its occurrence in the note to l. 14
  above.</p>

  <p>19. 'And (men also) see that Sloth holds her in a leash, (for her) to
  do nothing but sleep, and eat and drink, and devour all that others
  obtain by toil.' The reading <i>hir</i> refers to Idleness, which, as I
  have before explained, was a branch of Sloth, and was personified by a
  female. See notes to ll. 2 and 3 above. Tyrwhitt has <i>hem</i>, which is
  not in any of our seven MSS.</p>

  <p>21. Compare Piers Plowman, B. prol. 21, 22&mdash;</p>

  </div>

  <p>25. <i>After the legende</i>, following the Legend; i.&nbsp;e. the Legenda
  Aurea. A very small portion is wholly Chaucer's own. He has merely added
  a line here and there, such as ll. 488-497, 505-511, 535, 536. At l. 346
  he begins to be less literal; see notes to 380, 395, 443.</p>

  <p>27. St. Cecilia and St. Dorothea are both depicted with garlands. Mrs.
  Jameson tells us how to distinguish them in her Sacred and Legendary Art,
  3rd ed. 591. She also says, at p. 35&mdash;'The wreath of roses on the
  brow of St. Cecilia, the roses or fruits borne by St. Dorothea, are
  explained by the legends.' And again, at p. 36&mdash;'White and red roses
  expressed love and innocence, or love and wisdom, as in the garland with
  which the angels crown St. Cecilia.' <i>Red</i> was the symbol of love,
  divine fervour, &amp;c.; <i>white</i>, of light, purity, innocence,
  virginity. See ll. 220, 244, 279. The legend of St. Dorothea forms the
  subject of Massinger's Virgin Martyr.</p>

  <p>29. <i>virgin-es</i> must be a trisyllable here; such words are often
  shortened to a dissyllable. The word <i>thou</i> is addressed to the
  Virgin Mary. In the margin of MSS. E. and Hn. is written&mdash;'Inuocatio
  ad Mariam.'</p>

  <p>30. Speaking of St. Bernard, Mrs. Jameson says&mdash;'One of his most
  <!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page403"></a>[403]</span>celebrated works, the <i>Missus est</i>,
  was composed in her honour [i.&nbsp;e. in honour of the Virgin] as Mother of
  the Redeemer; and in eighty Sermons on texts from the Song of Solomon, he
  set forth her divine perfection as the Selected and Espoused, the type of
  the Church on earth'; Legends of the Monastic Orders, 2nd ed. p. 144. Cf.
  note to l. 58.</p>

  <p>See a further illustration of the great favour shewn by the Virgin to
  St. Bernard at p. 142 of the same volume; and, at p. 145, the description
  of a painting by Murillo, quoted from Stirling's Spanish Painters, p.
  914. See also Dante, Paradiso, xxxi. 102.</p>

  <p>32. <i>comfort of us wrecches</i>, comfort of us miserable sinners;
  see note to l. 58.</p>

  <p><i>do me endyte</i>, cause me to indite.</p>

  <p>34. <i>of the feend</i>, over the Fiend. Tyrwhitt reads <i>over</i>
  for <i>of</i>, but it is unneccessary. Accent <i>victórie</i> on the
  <i>o</i>.</p>

  <p>36. Lines 36-51 are a free translation of a passage in Dante's
  Paradiso, Canto xxxiii. ll. 1-21; and are quoted in the notes to Cary's
  translation. I am persuaded that ll. 36-56 (three stanzas) were added at
  a later period. Being taken from Dante, they could hardly have been
  written very early; whereas the Life of St. Cecile seems to have been
  quite a juvenile performance. And this explains why the phrase 'Me,
  flemed wrecche' in l. 58 is so far removed from the parallel expression,
  viz. 'us wrecches,' in l. 32. Cf. note to l. 58.</p>

  <p>The numbers at the side denote the corresponding lines.</p>

  <p>40. <i>nobledest</i>, didst ennoble; Dante's 'nobilitasti.' <!-- Page
  404 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page404"></a>[404]</span></p>

  <p>42. The translation is inexact. Dante says&mdash;'that its Maker
  (i.&nbsp;e. the Maker of human nature) did not disdain to become His own
  creature,' i.&nbsp;e. born of that very human nature which He had Himself
  created. Cf. l. 49.</p>

  <p>45. 'Who is Lord and Guide of the threefold space'; i.&nbsp;e. of the three
  abodes of things created, viz. the earth, the sea, and the heavens.</p>

  <p>46. <i>out of relees</i>, without release, i.&nbsp;e. without relaxation,
  without ceasing. <i>Out of</i> means <i>without</i>, as is clear from
  Prol. 487; Kn. Tale, A. 1141; and <i>relees</i> means <i>acquittance</i>
  (O. Fr. <i>relais</i>); see Cler. Tale, E. 153, &amp;c. There has been
  some doubt about the meaning of this phrase, but there need be none;
  especially when it is remembered that <i>to release</i> is another form
  of <i>to relax</i>, so that <i>relees</i> = <i>relaxation</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
  slackening. The idea is the same as that so admirably expressed in the
  Prolog im Himmel to Goethe's Faust.</p>

  <p>50. <i>Assembled is in thee</i>, there is united in thee; cf.
  Dante&mdash;'in te s'aduna.' This stanza closely resembles the fourth
  stanza of the Prioresses Prologue, B. 1664-1670.</p>

  <p>52. <i>sonne.</i> By all means let the reader remember that
  <i>sonne</i> was probably still feminine in English in Chaucer's time, as
  it is in German, Dutch, and Icelandic to this day. It will be found,
  however, that Chaucer commonly identifies the sun with Phoebus, making it
  masculine; see Prol. 8, Kn. Tale, A. 1493. Still, there is a remarkable
  example of the old use in the first rubric of Part ii. of Chaucer's
  Astrolabe&mdash;'To fynde the degree in which the sonne is day by day,
  after <i>hir</i> cours a-boute.' So again, in Piers Plowman, B. xviii.
  243.</p>

  <p>56. <i>hir lyves leche</i>, the physician of their lives (<i>or</i>
  life).</p>

  <p>58. <i>flemed wrecche</i>, banished exile. The proper sense of A. S.
  <i>wræcca</i> is an exile, a stranger; and thence, a miserable being. The
  phrase 'fleming of wrecches,' i.&nbsp;e. banishment of the miserable, occurs
  in Chaucer's Troilus, iii. 933. And see note to l. 36 above.</p>

  <p>Lounsbury (Studies, ii. 389) compares this line with l. 62 below, and
  suggests that Chaucer may have been influenced here by an expression in
  St. Bernard's Works (cf. l. 30): Respice ergo, beatissima Virgo, ad nos
  proscriptos in exsilio filios Euae'; Tractatus ad Laudem Gloriosae
  Virginis; in the Works, vol. i. p. 1148, in Migne's Patrologia, vol. 182.
  This suggestion greatly strengthens the probability, that ll. 36-56 form
  a later insertion.</p>

  <p><i>galle</i>, bitterness. There is probably an allusion to the name
  Mary, and to the Hebrew <i>mar</i>, fem. <i>mârâh</i>, bitter. Cf. Exod.
  xv. 23; Acts viii. 23; Ruth i. 20. Cf. Chaucer's A B C, l. 50.</p>

  <p>59. <i>womman Cananee</i>, a translation of <i>mulier Chananaea</i> in
  the Vulgate version of Matt. xv. 22. Wyclif calls her 'a womman of
  Canane.'</p>

  <p>60. Compare Wyclif's version&mdash;'for whelpis eten of the crummes
  that fallen doun fro the bord of her lordis'; Matt. xv. 27.</p>

  <p>62. <i>sone of Eve</i>, son of Eve, i.&nbsp;e. the author himself. This, as
  Tyrwhitt remarks (Introd. Discourse, note 30), is a clear proof that <!--
  Page 405 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page405"></a>[405]</span>the
  Tale was never properly revised to suit it for the collection. The
  expression is unsuitable for the supposed narrator, the Second Nun.</p>

  <p>64. See James, ii. 17.</p>

  <p>67. <i>ful of grace</i>; alluding to the phrase 'Aue gratia plena' in
  Luke, i. 28.</p>

  <p>68. <i>advócat</i>, accented on the penultimate.</p>

  <p>69. <i>Ther-as</i>, where that. <i>Osanne</i>, Hosanna, i.&nbsp;e. 'Save,
  we pray,' from Ps. cxviii. 25. See Concise Dict. of the Bible.</p>

  <p>70. The Virgin Mary was said to have been the daughter of Joachim and
  Anna; see the Protevangelion of James, and the Legenda Aurea, cap.
  cxxi&mdash;'De natiuitate beatae Mariae uirginis.' Cf. D. 1613.</p>

  <p>75. <i>haven of refut</i>, haven of refuge. See the same term
  similarly applied in B. 852, above. Cf. Chaucer's A. B. C., l. 14.</p>

  <p>78. <i>reden</i>, read. This is still clearer proof that the story was
  not originally meant to be narrated. Cf. note to l. 62.</p>

  <p>82. <i>him</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Jacobus Januensis. <i>at the</i>, &amp;c., out
  of reverence for the saint.</p>

  <p>83. <i>hir legende</i>, her (St. Cecilia's) legend as told in the
  Aurea Legenda. But cf. note to l. 349.</p>

  <p>85. The five stanzas in ll. 85-119 really belong to the Legend itself,
  and are in the original Latin. Throughout the notes to the rest of this
  Tale I usually follow the 2nd edition of the Legenda Aurea, cap. clxix,
  as edited by Dr. Th. Grässe; Leipsic, 1850.</p>

  <p>87. Several of the Legends of the Saints begin with ridiculous
  etymologies. Thus the Legend of St. Valentine (Aur. Leg. cap. xlii)
  begins with the explanation that Valentinus means <i>ualorem tenens</i>,
  or else <i>ualens tyro</i>. So here, as to the etymology of Caecilia, we
  are generously offered <i>five</i> solutions, all of them being wrong. As
  it is hopeless to understand them without consulting the original, I
  shall quote as much of it as is necessary, arranged in a less confused
  order. The true etymology is, of course, that Caecilia is the feminine of
  Caecilius, a name borne by members of the Caecilia gens, which claimed
  descent from Caeculus, an ancient Italian hero, son of Vulcan, who is
  said to have founded Praeneste. Caeculus, probably a nickname, can hardly
  be other than a mere diminutive of <i>caecus</i>, blind. The legendary
  etymologies are right, accordingly, only so far as they relate to
  <i>caecus</i>. Beyond that, they are strange indeed.</p>

  <p>The following are the etymologies, with their reasons.</p>

  <p>(1) Caecilia = coeli lilia (<i>sic</i>), i.&nbsp;e. <i>hevenes lilie</i>.
  Reasons:&mdash;'Fuit enim coeleste lilium per uirginitatis pudorem; uel
  dicitur <i>lilium</i>, quia habuit candorem munditiae, uirorem
  conscientiae, odorem bonae famae.' See ll. 87-91. Thus <i>grene</i> (=
  greenness) translates <i>uirorem</i>.</p>

  <p>(2) Caecilia = caecis uia, i.&nbsp;e. <i>the wey to blinde</i>, a path for
  the blind. Reason:&mdash;'Fuit enim caecis uia per exempli
  informationem.' See ll. 92, 93.</p>

  <p>(3) Caecilia is from <i>caelum</i> and <i>lya</i>. 'Fuit enim ...
  <i>coelum</i> (<i>sic</i>) per iugem contemplationem, <i>lya</i> per
  assiduam operationem.' Here <i>lya</i> is <!-- Page 406 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page406"></a>[406]</span>the same as <i>Lia</i>,
  which is the Latin spelling of Leah in the Book of Genesis. It was usual
  to consider Leah as the type of activity, or the Active Life, and Rachel
  as the type of the Contemplative Life. See Hampole's Prose Treatises, ed.
  Perry (E. E. T. S.), p. 29, where the comparison is attributed to St.
  Gregory. '<i>Lya</i> is als mekill at say as trauyliose, and betakyns
  actyfe lyfe.'</p>

  <p>(4) Caecilia, 'quasi caecitate carens.' This is on the celebrated
  principle of 'lucus a non lucendo.' Reason:&mdash;'fuit caecitate carens
  per sapientiae splendorem.' See ll. 99-101.</p>

  <p>(5) 'Vel dicitur a <i>coelo</i> et <i>leos</i>, i.&nbsp;e. populus.'
  Finally, recourse is had to Greek, viz. Gk. <span title="leôs" class="grk"
  >&lambda;&epsilon;&#x1F7D;&sigmaf;</span>, the Attic form of <span
  title="laos" class="grk">&lambda;&alpha;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>.
  Reason:&mdash;'fuit et coelum populi, quia in ipsa tamquam in coelo
  spirituali populus ad imitandum intuetur coelum, solem, lunam, et
  stellas, i.&nbsp;e. sapientiae perspicacitatem, fidei magnanimitatem et
  uirtutum uarietatem.' See ll. 102-112.</p>

  <p>113-118. Chaucer has somewhat varied the order; this last stanza
  belongs in the Latin to derivation (3), though it may serve also for
  derivation (5). It is probably for this reason that he has reserved it.
  The Latin is&mdash;'Vel dicitur coelum, quia, sicut dicit Ysidorus,
  coelum philosophi uolubile, rotundum et ardens esse dixerunt. Sic et ipsa
  fuit uolubilis per operationem sollicitam, rotunda per perseuerantiam,
  ardens per caritatem succensam.' For the <i>swiftness</i> and
  <i>roundness</i> of heaven, see note to B. 295. The epithet
  <i>burning</i> is due to quite another matter, not explained in that
  note. The nine astronomical spheres there mentioned did not suffice for
  the wants of theology. Hence a <i>tenth</i> sphere was imagined, external
  to the ninth; but this was supposed to be fixed, whereas the <i>ninth</i>
  sphere (or <i>primum mobile</i>) had a swift diurnal movement of
  revolution (note to B. 295), and thus supplied the two former epithets.
  The outermost sphere was called the <i>empyraeum</i> (from Gk. <span
  title="empuros" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&mu;&pi;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, burning, which
  from <span title="en" class="grk">&#x1F10;&nu;</span>, in, and <span
  title="pur" class="grk">&pi;&#x1FE6;&rho;</span>, fire) where the pure
  element of fire subsisted alone; and it was supposed to be the abode of
  saints and angels. Milton, in his Paradise Lost, uses the word
  <i>empyrean</i> six times, ii. 771, iii. 57, vi. 833, vii. 73, 633, x.
  321; and the word <i>empyreal</i> eleven times.</p>

  <p>120. For some account of St. Caecilia, see vol. iii. p. 489. Compare
  also the Life of St. Cecilia as printed in the South-English Legendary,
  ed. Horstmann (E. E. T. S.), p. 490.</p>

  <p>133. <i>an heyre</i>, a hair shirt. The usual expression; see I. 1052;
  and P. Plowman, B. v. 66. Lat. text&mdash;'cilicio erat induta.'</p>

  <p>134. <i>the organs</i>; Lat. 'cantantibus organis.' We should now say
  'the organ'; but in old authors the plural form is commonly employed.
  Sometimes the word <i>organ</i> seems to refer to a single pipe only, and
  the whole instrument was called 'the organs' or 'a pair of organs,' where
  <i>pair</i> means a <i>set</i>, as in the phrase 'a peire of bedes'; Ch.
  Prol. 159. In the Nonne Preestes Tale, B. 4041, Chaucer uses <i>orgon</i>
  as a plural, equivalent to the Lat. <i>organa</i>. On the early meaning
  of <i>organum</i>, see Chappell's Hist. of Music, i. 327. <!-- Page 407
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page407"></a>[407]</span></p>

  <p>St. Cecilia is commonly considered the patroness of music; see
  Dryden's Ode for St. Cecilia's day, and Alexander's Feast, ll. 132-141.
  But the connexion of her name with music is not very ancient, as Mrs.
  Jameson explains. The <i>reason</i> for this connexion seems to me clear
  enough, viz. the simple fact that the word <i>organis</i> occurs in this
  very passage. Besides, St. Cecilia is here represented as singing
  <i>herself</i>&mdash;'in corde soli domino <i>decantabat</i> dicens'; see
  l. 135. The South-E. Legendary (see n. to l. 120) says she sang a verse
  of the Psalter.</p>

  <p>145. <i>conseil</i>, a secret; Lat. 'mysterium.' And so in l. 192, and
  in P. Plowm. B. v. 168; see note to C. 819 above. <i>and</i>, if.</p>

  <p>150. <i>here</i>, her, is a dissyllable in Chaucer whenever it ends a
  line, which it does six times; see e.g. B. 460; Kn. Tale, 1199 (A. 2057).
  This is quite correct, because the A.&nbsp;S. form <i>hire</i> is dissyllabic
  also.</p>

  <p>159. <i>me gye</i>, rule me, keep me; lit. guide me.</p>

  <p>173. Chaucer has here mistranslated the Latin. It is not said that the
  Via Appia (which led out of Rome through the Porta Capena to Aricia, Tres
  Tabernae, Appii Forum, and so on towards Capua and Brundusium) was
  situated three miles from Rome; but that Valerian is to go along the
  Appian Way as far as to the third milestone. 'Vade igitur in tertium
  milliarium ab urbe uia quae Appia nuncupatur.' See the South-E.
  Legendary, l. 37.</p>

  <p>177. <i>Urban.</i> St. Urban's day is May 25. This is Urban I., pope,
  who succeeded Calixtus, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 222. Besides the
  notice of him in this Tale, his legend is given separately in the Legenda
  Aurea, cap. lxxvii. He was beheaded May 25, 230, and succeeded by
  Pontianus.</p>

  <p>178. <i>secree nedes</i>, secret necessary reasons; Lat. 'secreta
  mandata.'</p>

  <p>181. <i>purged yow</i>, viz. by the rite of baptism.</p>

  <p>186. <i>seintes buriels</i>, burial-places of the saints; Lat.
  'sepulchra martirum.' It is worth observing, perhaps, that the form
  <i>buriels</i> is properly <i>singular</i>, not plural; cf. A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>byrigels</i>, a sepulchre, and see the examples in Stratmann. In P.
  Plowman, B. xix. 142, the Jews are represented as guarding Christ's body
  because it had been foretold that He should rise from the tomb&mdash;</p>

      <p class="hg1">'þat þat blessed body · of <i>burieles</i> shulde rise.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The mistake of supposing <i>s</i> to be the mark of a plural was
  easily made, and the singular form <i>buriel</i> was evolved. This
  mistake occurs as early as in Wyclif's Bible, IV Kings xxiii. 17; see
  Way's note in Prompt. Parv. p. 37, note 1. Consequently, it is most
  likely that Chaucer has made the same mistake here. The South-E.
  Legendary (see note to l. 120) says that Urban dwelt 'among puttes and
  burieles.'</p>

  <p>There is here a most interesting allusion to the celebrated catacombs
  of Rome; see Chambers, Book of Days, i. 101, 102.</p>

  <p><i>lotinge</i>, lying hid. In MS. E., the Latin word <i>latitantem</i>
  is written above, as a gloss. This was taken from the Latin text, which
  has&mdash;'intra sepulchra martirum latitantem.' Stratmann gives six
  examples <!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page408"></a>[408]</span>of the use of <i>lotien</i> or
  <i>lutien</i>, to lie hid. It occurs once in P. Plowman, B. xvii.
  102.</p>

  <p>201. <i>An old man</i>; i.&nbsp;e. an angel in the form of an old man, viz.
  St. Paul. Cf. note to l. 207.</p>

  <p>202. <i>with lettre of gold</i>; Lat. 'tenens librum aureis litteris
  scriptum.' L. 203 is not in the original.</p>

  <p>205. 'When he (Valerian) saw him (the old man); and he (the old man)
  lifted up him (Valerian); and then he (Valerian) began thus to read in
  his (the old man's) book.' This is very ambiguous in Chaucer, but the
  Latin is clear. 'Quem uidens Ualerianus prae nimio timore quasi mortuus
  cecidit, et a sene leuatus sic legit.'</p>

  <p>207. <i>Oo lord</i>, one lord. Tyrwhitt prints <i>On</i>, 'to guard
  against the mistake which the editions generally have fallen into, of
  considering <i>o</i>, in this passage, as the sign of the vocative case.'
  For the same reason, I have printed <i>Oo</i>, as in MS. Pt., in
  preference to the single <i>O</i>, as in most MSS. Even one of the
  scribes has fallen into the trap, and has written against this
  passage&mdash;'Et lamentat.' See MS. Cp., in the Six-text edition. The
  fact is, obviously, that ll. 207-209 are a close translation of Eph. iv.
  5, 6. Hence the old man was St. Paul.</p>

  <p>208. <i>Cristendom</i>, baptism; Lat. 'baptisma.' See l. 217.</p>

  <p>216. We must read <i>the</i> before <i>oldë</i>, not <i>this</i> or
  <i>that</i>, because <i>e</i> in <i>the</i> must be elided; otherwise the
  line will not scan.</p>

  <p>223-224. <i>that oon</i>, the one; sometimes written <i>the ton</i> or
  <i>the toon</i>. <i>That other</i>, the one; sometimes written <i>the
  tother</i>. 'The ton' is obsolete; but 'the tother' may still be heard.
  <i>That</i> is the neuter of the A.&nbsp;S. def. article <i>se</i>,
  <i>s&#x113;o</i>, <i>þæt</i>; cf. Germ. <i>der</i>, <i>die</i>,
  <i>das</i>.</p>

  <p>As to the signification of the red and white flowers, see note to l.
  27 above.</p>

  <p>Compare Act v. sc. 1 of Massinger's Virgin Martyr, where an angel
  brings flowers from St. Dorothea, who is in paradise, to Theophilus. See
  note to l. 248 below.</p>

  <p>232. <i>for</i>, because; Lat. 'quia.'</p>

  <p>236. Afterwards repeated, very nearly, in Kn. Tale, l. 338 (A.
  1196).</p>

  <p>243. <i>savour undernom</i>, perceived the scent; Lat. 'sensisset
  odorem.'</p>

  <p>246. Cf. the South-E. Legendary (see note to l. 120), l. 89.</p>

    </div>

  <p>248. <i>rose.</i> We should have expected <i>roses</i>. Perhaps this
  is due to the peculiar form of the Latin text, which has&mdash;'roseus

  <p>Compare the words of Theophilus in the Virgin Martyr, v. 1:&mdash;</p>

  <p>270. Ll. 270-283 are certainly genuine, and the passage is in the
  Latin text. It is also in the French version, but it does not appear in
  the Early English version of the story printed by Mr. Furnivall from MS.
  Ashmole 43, nor in the English version printed by Caxton in 1483; <!--
  Page 409 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page409"></a>[409]</span>nor
  in the version in the South-E. Legendary. Tyrwhitt's supposition is no
  doubt correct, viz. that this passage 'appears evidently to have been at
  first a marginal observation and to have crept into the [Latin] text by
  the blunder of some copyist.' He truly observes that these fourteen lines
  'interrupt the narrative awkwardly, and to little purpose.'</p>

  <p>271. <i>Ambrose.</i> 'Huic miraculo de coronis rosarum Ambrosius
  attestatur in praefatione, sic dicens,' &amp;c. I cannot find anything of
  the kind in the indices to the works of St. Ambrose.</p>

  <p>In the Sermons of Jacques de Vitry, a story is given beginning with
  the words&mdash;'Beatus Ambrosius narrat,' to this effect. St. Ambrose
  tells of a virgin going to martyrdom, who was asked by a pagan whither
  she was going. She answered: 'to see my friend, who has invited me to his
  wedding-feast.' The pagan, deriding her, said: 'Tell your friend to send
  me some of his roses.' Shortly after her death, a beautiful youth brought
  to the pagan a basket full of full-blown roses, saying, 'The friend of
  the woman, who just now passed by, sends you some of the roses you
  desired,' and then disappeared. The pagan was converted and himself
  suffered martyrdom. This is the story of St. Dorothea, whose day is Feb.
  6; for which Alban Butler refers us to Aldhelm, De Laude Virginitatis, c.
  25.</p>

  <p>276. <i>eek hir chambre</i>, even hir marriage-chamber, i.&nbsp;e. even
  marriage. <i>weyve</i>, waive, abandon. Lat. 'ipsum mundum est cum
  thalamis exsecrata.' <i>weyve</i> occurs again in some MSS. of Chaucer's
  <i>Truth</i>, l. 20.</p>

  <p>277. <i>shrifte</i>, confession. Lat. 'testis est Valeriani coniugis
  et Tiburtii prouocata confessio, quos, Domine, angelica manu odoriferis
  floribus coronasti.' For <i>Valerians</i>, all the MSS. have
  <i>Cecilies</i>. Whether the mistake is Chaucer's or his scribes', I
  cannot say; but it is so obviously a mere slip, that we need not hesitate
  to correct it. The French text is even clearer than the Latin; it
  has&mdash;'et de cest tesmoing Valerien son mary et Tiburcien son frere.'
  Besides, the express mention of 'these men' in l. 281 is enough, in my
  opinion, to shew that the slip was <i>not</i> Chaucer's own; or, at any
  rate, was a mere oversight.</p>

  <p>282. 'The world hath known (by their example) how much, in all truth,
  it is worth to love such devotion to chastity.' Lat. 'mundus agnouit,
  quantum ualeat deuotio castitatis;&mdash;haec Ambrosius.' This is quoted
  as St. Ambrose's opinion. The parenthesis ends here.</p>

  <p>288. <i>beste</i>, i.&nbsp;e. void of understanding, as a beast of the
  field is. Lat. 'pecus est.'</p>

  <p>315. <i>And we.</i> Tyrwhitt remarks that <i>we</i> should have been
  <i>us</i>. But a glance at the Latin text shews what was in Chaucer's
  mind; he is here merely anticipating the <i>we</i> in l. 318. Lat. 'et
  <i>nos</i> in illius flammis pariter inuoluemur, et dum quaerimus
  diuinitatem latentem in coelis, incurremus furorem exurentem in terris.'
  The sentence is awkward; but <i>we</i> was intended. The idiom has
  overridden the grammar. Cf. the South-E. Legendary (see note to l. 120),
  l. 121:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Forberne he scholde, and <i>we</i> also, yif we with him were.' <!--
  Page 410 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page410"></a>[410]</span></p>

  <p>319. <i>Cecile.</i> This is one of the clearest instances to shew that
  Chaucer followed the Latin and not the French version. Lat. 'Cui
  Caecilia'; Fr. 'et Valerien dist.' Mr. Furnivall has noted this and other
  instances, and there is no doubt about the matter.</p>

  <p>320. <i>skilfully</i>, reasonably; the usual meaning at this date. See
  l. 327.</p>

  <p>325-332. Not in the South-E. Legendary.</p>

  <p>327. 'And all that has been created by a reasonable Intelligence.'</p>

  <p>329. <i>Hath sowled</i>, hath endued with a soul, hath quickened; Lat.
  'animauit.'</p>

  <p>335. <i>o god</i>, one God. We must suppose this teaching to be
  included in the mention of Christ in l. 295; otherwise there is no
  allusion to it in the words of Cecilia. The doctrine had been taught to
  Valerian however; see ll. 207, 208.</p>

  <p>There are continual allusions, in the Lives of the Saints, to the
  difficulty of this doctrine.</p>

  <p>338. Chaucer is not quite exact. The Latin says that three things
  reside in a man's wisdom, the said wisdom being but <i>one</i>. 'Sicut in
  una hominis sapientia tria sunt, ingenium, memoria et intellectus.' The
  notion resembles that in a favourite passage from Isidore quoted in Piers
  Plowman, B. xv. 39, to the effect that the soul (<i>anima</i>) has
  different names according to its functions. Compare the curious
  illustrations of the doctrine of the Trinity in the same, B. xvi.
  220-224, xvii. 137-249. The illustration in the text is, as Mr. Jephson
  points out, by no means a good one.</p>

  <p>341. The word <i>Three</i> stands alone in the first foot. See note to
  l. 353.</p>

  <p>343. <i>come</i>, coming, i.&nbsp;e. incarnation; Lat. 'aduentu.' Tyrwhitt
  reads <i>sonde</i>, i.&nbsp;e. sending, message; but incorrectly.</p>

  <p>345. <i>withholde</i>, detained, constrained to dwell; Lat. 'tentus';
  Fr. 'tenu.'</p>

  <p>346. Hitherto Chaucer's translation is, on the whole, very close. Here
  he omits a whole sentence, and begins to abbreviate the story and alter
  it to suit himself. See his hint in l. 360.</p>

  <p>349. Here begins, practically, the <i>second part</i> of the story, in
  which the <i>second</i> Latin text is more freely consulted; see vol.
  iii. p. 488.</p>

  <p>351. <i>That</i>, who. In MS. E. the word is glossed by&mdash;'qui,
  scilicet Vrbanus.' It is remarkable that the relative <i>who</i> (as a
  <i>simple</i> relative, without <i>so</i> suffixed) is hardly to be found
  in English of this date, in the <i>nominative</i> case. The A.&nbsp;S.
  hw&#x101; is only used interrogatively. See March, Anglo-Saxon Grammar,
  p. 179.</p>

  <p>353. <i>goddes knight</i>, God's servant, or rather, God's soldier;
  see l. 383, and the note. In the A.&nbsp;S. version of the Gospels, Christ's
  disciples are called 'leorning-cnihtas.' In the Ormulum and in Wyclif
  <i>cniht</i> or <i>kni&#x21D;t</i> sometimes means a servant, but more
  commonly a soldier. Priests are called 'goddes knyghtes' in Piers
  Plowman, B. xi. 304. In scanning this line, either <i>lerninge</i> is of
  three syllables (which I doubt) or else the first syllable in
  <i>Parfit</i> forms a foot by itself; see note to l. 341 above. <!-- Page
  411 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page411"></a>[411]</span></p>

  <p>361. In the South-E. Legendary, their crime is specified; they had
  buried two Christian martyrs.</p>

  <p>362. <i>Almache</i>; Lat. 'Almachius praefectus.' The reigning emperor
  was Alexander Severus (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 222-235).</p>

  <p>363. <i>apposed</i>, questioned, examined; written <i>opposed</i> in
  most MSS., but corrected by Tyrwhitt. Ed. 1532 also has <i>aposed</i>. A
  similar confusion occurs in the Freres Tale, D. 1597, where only two
  MSS., viz. Pt. and Ln., have the spelling <i>appose</i>, as against five
  others which read <i>opposen</i>. In MSS. of Piers the Plowman, we find
  <i>appose</i>, to question, B. iii. 5; <i>apposed</i>, i. 47;
  <i>apposeden</i>, vii. 138. See <i>Appose</i> in the New E. Dict.; where
  it is shewn that <i>appose</i> was, at first, a mere variant of
  <i>oppose</i>, but came to be regarded as a correct form with a special
  sense; though, strictly speaking, it was a corruption.</p>

  <p>365. <i>sacrifyse</i>, sacrifice to the idol. This was the usual test
  to which Christians were subjected; see note to l. 395. Compare Dan. iii.
  14, 18. So in the Virgin Martyr, iv. 2:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Bow but thy knee to Jupiter, and offer</p>
      <p>Any slight sacrifice; or do but swear</p>
      <p>By Caesar's fortune, and&mdash;be free!'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>367. <i>thise martirs</i>; note that this is an accusative case.</p>

  <p>369. <i>corniculere</i>, a sort of officer. The note in Bell's
  edition, that the French version has <i>prevost</i> here, is wrong. The
  word <i>prevost</i> (Lat. <i>praefectus</i>) is applied to Almachius.
  Maximus was only a subordinate officer, and is called in the Early Eng.
  version (MS. Ashmole 43) the 'gailer.' The expression 'Maximo
  Corniculario' occurs only in the Lives of Valerian and Tiburtius, in the
  Acta Sanctorum (April 14); and we thus gather that Chaucer consulted this
  source also. This was noticed by Dr. Kölbing, in the Englische Studien,
  i. 215; and I subsequently noticed it myself, independently.</p>

  <p>Riddle's Lat. Dict. gives&mdash;'<i>Cornicularius</i>, <span
  class="nw">-i.</span> m. a soldier who was presented with a
  <i>corniculum</i>, and by means of it promoted to a higher rank; hence,
  <i>an assistant of an officer</i>, Suetonius, Domit. 17; then also in the
  civil service, <i>an assistant of a magistrate, a clerk, registrar,
  secretary</i>; Cod. Just.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Corniculum</i>, -i. n. (dimin. of <i>cornu</i>). 1. <i>A little
  horn</i>, Pliny; also, <i>a small funnel of horn</i>, Columella. <i>An
  ornament in the shape of a horn worn on the helmet</i>, with which
  officers presented meritorious soldiers; Livy, 10. 44.'</p>

  <p>Ducange gives several examples, shewing that the word commonly meant a
  secretary, clerk, or registrar. Tyrwhitt refers us to Pitiscus, Lex. Ant.
  Rom. s.&nbsp;v. <i>Cornicularius</i>.</p>

  <p>373. 'He got leave for himself from the executioners.'
  <i>tormentoures</i>, executioners; Lat. 'carnifices.' See l. 527. Cf.
  <i>tormentor</i> in Matt, xviii. 34; see Wright's Bible Word-book.</p>

  <p>380. <i>preestes</i>, priests. The original says that pope Urban came
  himself. <!-- Page 412 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page412"></a>[412]</span></p>

  <p>383. <i>knightes</i>, soldiers; as in l. 353. Lat. 'Eia milites
  Christi, abicite opera tenebrarum, et induimini arma lucis.' See Rom.
  xiii. 12.</p>

  <p>386. Tyrwhitt notes a slight defect in the use of <i>y-doon</i> in l.
  386, followed by <i>doon</i> in l. 387. The first six lines in this
  stanza are not in the original, but are imitated from 2 Tim. iv. 7,
  8.</p>

  <p>395. 'This was the criterion. The Christians were brought to the image
  of Jupiter or of the Emperor, and commanded to join in the sacrifice, by
  eating part of it, or to throw a few grains of incense into the censer,
  in token of worship; if they refused, they were put to death. See Pliny's
  celebrated letter to Trajan. Those who complied were termed
  <i>sacrificati</i> and <i>thurificati</i> by the canons, and were
  excluded from the communion for seven or ten years, or even till their
  death, according to the circumstances of their lapse.&mdash;See Bingham's
  Antiquities, b. xvi. 4. 5.'&mdash;Note in Bell's edition of Chaucer. Cf.
  note to l. 365.</p>

  <p>This stanza is represented in the original (in spite of the hint in l.
  394) by only a few words. 'Quarto igitur milliario ab urbe sancti ad
  statuam Iovis ducuntur, et dum sacrificare nollent, pariter
  decollantur.'</p>

  <p>405. <i>to-bete</i>, beat severely; <i>dide him so to-bete</i>, caused
  (men) to beat him so severely, caused him to be so severely beaten. I
  have no hesitation in adopting the reading of ed. 1532 here.
  <i>To-bete</i> is just the right word, and occurs in MSS. Cp. Pt. Ln.;
  and, though these MSS. are not the best ones, it is clear that
  <i>to-bete</i> is the original reading, or it would not appear. To scan
  the line, slur over <i><span class="nw">-ius</span></i> in
  <i>Almachius</i>, and accent <i>dide</i>.</p>

  <p>406. <i>whippe of leed</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a whip furnished with leaden
  plummets. Lat. 'eum plumbatis tamdiu caedi fecit,' &amp;c.; French
  text&mdash;'il le fist tant batre de plombees,' &amp;c.; Caxton&mdash;'he
  dyd do bete hym with plomettes of leed.'</p>

  <p>413. <i>encense</i>, offer incense to; see note to l. 395.</p>

  <p>414. <i>they.</i> Over this word is written in MS. E.&mdash;'scilicet
  Ministres.' The Latin original says that Cecilia converted as many as 400
  persons upon this occasion. Hence the expression <i>o voys</i> (one
  voice) in l. 420.</p>

  <p>417. <i>withouten difference</i>, i.&nbsp;e. without difference in might,
  majesty, or glory.</p>

  <p>430. <i>lewedly</i>, ignorantly. The 'two answers' relate to her rank
  and her religion, subjects which had no real connexion.</p>

  <p>434. Lat. 'de conscientia bona et fide non ficta'; cf. 1 Tim. i.
  5.</p>

  <p>437. <i>to drede</i>, to be feared; the gerund, and right according to
  the old idiom. We still say&mdash;'he is <i>to blame</i>,' 'this house
  <i>to let</i>.' March in his Anglo-Saxon Grammar, p. 198, says&mdash;'The
  gerund after the copula expresses what <i>must</i>, <i>may</i>, or
  <i>should</i> be done. Ex. <i>Mannes sunu is t&#x14D; syllanne</i>, the

  <p>442. <i>bigonne</i>, didst begin; the right form, for which Tyrwhitt
  has <i>begonnest</i>. For the Mid. Eng. <i>biginnen</i> we commonly find
  <i>onginnan</i> in Anglo-Saxon, and the past tense runs
  thus&mdash;<i>ongann</i>, <i>ongunne</i>, <i>ongann</i>; pl.
  <i>ongunnon</i>. The form in Middle English is&mdash;<i>bigan</i>,
  <i>bigunne</i> (or <i>bigonne</i>), <i>bigan</i>; pl. <i>bigunnen</i> (or
  <i>bigonne</i>). The very form here used occurs in the Ayenbite of Inwyt,
  ed. Morris, p. 71. The suffix <i><span class="nw">-st</span></i> does not
  appear in <i>strong</i> verbs; cf. <i>Thou sawe</i>, B. 848; <i>thou
  bar</i>, G. 48.</p>

  <p>The whole of ll. 443-467 varies considerably from the original, the
  corresponding passage of which is as follows: 'Cui Almachius: "ab
  iniuriis caepisti, et in iniuriis perseueras." Caecilia respondit:
  "iniuria non dicitur quod uerbis fallentibus irrogatur; unde aut iniuriam
  doce, si falsa locuta sum, aut te ipsum corripe calumniam inferentem, sed
  nos scientes sanctum Dei nomen omnino negare non possumus; melius est
  enim feliciter mori quam infeliciter uiuere." Cui Almachius: "ad quid cum
  tanta superbia loqueris?" Et illa: "non est superbia, sed constantia."
  Cui Almachius: "infelix, ignoras,"' &amp;c. (l. 468). However, Chaucer
  has adopted an idea from this in ll. 473, 475.</p>

  <p>463. To scan this, remember that <i>Iuge</i> has two syllables; and
  accent <i>confus</i> on the first syllable.</p>

  <p>485. Lat. 'es igitur minister mortis, non uitae.'</p>

  <p>487. <i>Do wey</i>, do away with; Lat. 'depone.' The phrase occurs
  again in the Milleres Tale, A. 3287.</p>

  <p>489-497. These lines are wholly Chaucer's own.</p>

  <p>490. To scan the line, elide <i>e</i> in <i>suffre</i>, and read
  <i>phílosóphre</i>.</p>

  <p>492. <i>spekest</i>; to be read as <i>spek'st</i>.</p>

  <p>498. <i>utter yen</i>, outer eyes, bodily eyes. In MS. E. it is
  glossed by 'exterioribus oculis.' The Latin has&mdash;'nescio ubi oculos
  amiseris; nam quos tu Deos dicis, omnes nos saxa esse uidemus; mitte
  igitur manum et tangendo disce, quod oculis non uales uidere.'</p>

  <p>503. <i>taste</i>, test, try; Lat. 'tangendo disce.' The word is now
  restricted to <i>one</i> of the five senses; it could once have been used
  also of the sense of feeling, at the least. Bottom even ventures on the
  strange expression&mdash;'I trust to <i>taste</i> of truest Thisbe's
  <i>sight</i>'; Mid. Nt. Dream, v. 1. 280; such is the reading in the
  first folio.</p>

  <p>505-511. This stanza is all Chaucer's own.</p>

  <p>515. <i>bath of flambes rede</i>; Lat. 'in bulliente balneo.'</p>

  <p>516-522. The Latin merely has&mdash;'Quae quasi in loco frigido
  permansit, nec modicum saltem sudoris persensit.'</p>

  <p>533. Lat. 'eam semiuiuam cruentus carnifex dereliquit.'</p>

  <p>534. <i>is went</i>, though only in the (excellent) Cambridge MS., is
  the right reading; the rest have <i>he wente</i>, sometimes misspelt
  <i>he went</i>. In the first place, <i>is went</i> is a common phrase in
  Chaucer; cf. German <i>er ist gegangen</i>, and Eng. <i>he is gone</i>.
  But secondly, the false rime detects the blunder at once; Chaucer does
  not rime the weak past tense <i>wentë</i> with a past participle like
  <i>yhent</i>. This was obvious to me at the first glance, but the matter
  was made sure by consulting Mr. Cromie's excellent 'Ryme-Index.' This at
  once gives the examples <i>is went</i>, <!-- Page 414 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page414"></a>[414]</span>riming with pp.
  <i>to-rent</i>, E. 1012 (Clerkes Tale); <i>is went</i>, riming with
  <i>instrument</i>, F. 567 (Sq. Tale); <i>is went</i>, riming with
  <i>innocent</i>, B. 1730, and <i>ben went</i>, riming with
  <i>pavement</i>, B. 1869 (Prioresses Tale). Besides this, there are two
  more examples, viz. <i>be they went</i>, riming with <i>sacrement</i>, E.
  1701; and <i>that he be went</i>, riming with <i>sent</i>, A. 3665. On
  the other hand, we find <i>wente</i>, <i>sente</i>, <i>hente</i>, and
  <i>to-rente</i>, all (weak) past tenses, and all riming together, in the
  Monkes Tale, B. 3446. The student should particularly observe an instance
  like this. The rules of rime in Chaucer are, on the whole, so carefully
  observed that, when once they are learnt, a false rime jars upon the ear
  with such discord as to be unpleasantly remarkable, and should be at once
  detected.</p>

  <p>535-536. These two lines are not in the original.</p>

  <p>539. 'She began to preach to them whom she had fostered,' i.&nbsp;e.
  converted. To <i>foster</i> is here to nurse, to bring up, to educate in
  the faith; see l. 122 above. The Latin text has&mdash;'omnes quos ad
  fidem conuerterat, Urbano episcopo commendauit.' Tyrwhitt makes nonsense
  of this line by placing the comma after <i>hem</i> instead of after
  <i>fostred</i>, and other editors have followed him. In MSS. E. and Hn.
  the metrical pause is rightly marked as occurring after <i>fostred</i>.
  The story here closely resembles the end of the Prioresses Tale, B.
  1801-1855.</p>

  <p>545. <i>do werche</i>, cause to be constructed.</p>

  <p>549. Lat. 'inter episcopos sepeliuit.'</p>

  <p>550. 'It is now a church in Rome, and gives a title to a cardinal';
  note in Bell's edition. In a poem called the Stacyons of Rome, ed.
  Furnivall, l. 832, we are told that 100 years' pardon may be obtained by
  going to St. Cecilia's church. Mr. W. M. Rossetti, in a note on this
  line, says&mdash;'The Church of St. Cecilia, at the end of the
  Trastevere, near the Quay of Ripa Grande, was built on the site of the
  saint's own house in 230; rebuilt by pope Paschal I. in 821, and
  dedicated to God and Sts. Mary, Peter, Paul, and Cecilia; and altered to
  its present form in 1599 and 1725. In the former of these years, 1599,
  the body of the saint was found on the spot, with a contemporary
  inscription identifying her: the celebrated statue by Stefano Maderno,
  now in the church, represents her in the attitude she was discovered
  lying in.'</p>

  <p>553. After this line the Latin adds&mdash;'Passa est autem circa annos
  domini <span class="sm">CC</span> et <span class="sm">XXIII</span>,
  tempore Alexandri imperatoris. Alibi autem legitur, quod passa sit
  tempore Marci Aurelii, qui imperauit circa annos domini <span
  class="sm">XXCC</span>.' The confusion of names here is easily explained.
  Marcus Aurelius died in 180; but Marcus Aurelius Alexander Severus (for
  such was his title in full) reigned from 222 to 235. The true date is
  generally considered to be 230, falling within his reign, as it should
  do.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Canon's Yeoman's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>554. <i>the lyf of seint Cecyle</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the Second Nun's Tale. This
  notice is important, because it inseparably links the Canon's Yeoman's
  Tale to the preceding one. <!-- Page 415 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page415"></a>[415]</span></p>

  <p>555. <i>fyve myle</i>, five miles. Tyrwhitt says that it is five miles
  'from <i>some place</i>, which we are now unable to determine with
  certainty.' He adds that he is in doubt whether the pilgrims are here
  supposed to be riding <i>from</i> or <i>towards</i> Canterbury; but
  afterwards thinks that 'the manner in which the Yeman expresses himself
  in ver. 16091, 2 [i.&nbsp;e. ll. 623, 624] seems to shew that he was riding
  <i>to</i> Canterbury.'</p>

  <p>It is really very easy to explain the matter, and to tell all about
  it. It is perfectly clear that these two lines express the fact that they
  were riding <i>to</i> Canterbury. It is even probable that <i>every
  one</i> of the extant Tales refers to the outward journey: for Chaucer
  would naturally write his first set of Tales before beginning a second,
  and the extant Tales are insufficient to make even the first set
  complete. Consequently, we have only to reckon backwards from Boughton
  (see l. 556) for a five-mile distance along the <i>old</i> Canterbury
  road, and we shall find the name of the place intended.</p>

  <p>The answer to this is&mdash;Ospringe. The matter is settled by the
  discovery that Ospringe was, as a matter of fact, one of the
  halting-places for the night of travellers from London to Canterbury.
  Dean Stanley, in his Historical Memorials of Canterbury, p. 237, quotes
  from a paper in the Archæologia, xxxv. 461, by Mr. E. A. Bond, to shew
  that queen Isabella, wife of Edw. II., rested in London on June 6, 1358;
  at Dartford on the 7th; at Rochester on the 8th; at <i>Ospringe</i> on
  the 9th; and at Canterbury on the 10th and 11th; and returned, on the
  12th, to <i>Ospringe again</i>. See this, more at length, in Dr.
  Furnivall's Temporary Preface to the Canterbury Tales (Chaucer Soc.), pp.
  13, 14.</p>

  <p>Dr. Furnivall quotes again from M. Douet-d'Arcq, concerning a journey
  made by king John of France from London to Dover, by way of Canterbury,
  in 1360. On June 30, 1360, king John left London and came to Eltham. On
  July 1, he slept at Dartford; on July 2, at Rochester; on July 3, he
  dined at Sittingbourne (noted as being thirty-nine miles and
  three-quarters from London), and slept at <i>Ospringe</i>; and on July 4,
  came to Canterbury (noted as being fifty-four miles and a half from
  London).</p>

  <p>These extracts clearly shew (1) that the whole journey was usually
  made to occupy three or four days; (2) that the usual resting-places were
  (at least) Dartford, Rochester, and Ospringe; and (3) that Sittingbourne
  was considered as being about fifteen miles from Canterbury.</p>

  <p>Now, in passing from Sittingbourne to Canterbury, we find that the
  distance is divided into three very nearly equal parts by the situations
  of Ospringe and Boughton, giving five miles for each portion. The
  distance from Ospringe to Canterbury, only ten miles, left very little to
  be done on the last day; but pilgrims liked arriving at Canterbury in
  good time. Chaucer says, as plainly as possible, that the pilgrims really
  <i>did</i> rest all night on the road, at a place which can only be
  Ospringe; see ll. 588, 589.</p>

  <p>Mr. Furnivall also notes (Temp. Pref. p. 29), that Lydgate, in his
  <!-- Page 416 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page416"></a>[416]</span>Storie of Thebes (in Speght's Chaucer,
  1602, fol. 353 back, col. 2) makes the pilgrims, on their
  homeward-journey, return from Canterbury to Ospringe to dinner.</p>

  <p>556. <i>Boghton-under-Blee.</i> Here <i>Blee</i> is the same as <i>the
  blee</i> in Group H, l. 3, which see. It is now called Blean Forest, and
  the village is called Boughton-under-Blean, in order to distinguish it
  from other villages of the same name. I find, in a map, Boughton Aluph
  between Canterbury and Ashford, Boughton Malherb between Ashford and
  Maidstone, and Boughton Monchelsea between Maidstone and Staplehurst.</p>

  <p>557. <i>A man</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the Canon. This is an additional pilgrim, not
  described in the Prologue, and therefore described here in ll. 566-581,
  600-655, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>'The name of Canon, as applied to an officer in the Church, is derived
  from the Gk. <span title="kanôn" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&nu;&#x1F7D;&nu;</span> (<i>kanôn</i>) signifying a rule
  or measure, and also the roll or catalogue of the Church, in which the
  names of the Ecclesiastics were registered; hence the clergy so
  registered were denominated Canonici or Canons. Before the Reformation,
  they were divided into two classes, Regular and Secular. The Secular were
  so called, because they canonized <i>in saeculo</i>, abroad in the world.
  Regular Canons were such as lived under a rule, that is, a code of laws
  published by the founder of that order. They were a less strict sort of
  religious than the monks, but lived together under one roof, had a common
  dormitory and refectory, and were obliged to observe the statutes of
  their order. The chief rule for these [regular] canons is that of St.
  Augustine, who was made bishop of Hippo in the year 395.... Their habit
  was a long black cassock with a white rochet over it, and over that a
  black coat and hood; from whence they were called <i>Black</i> Canons
  Regular of St. Augustine.'&mdash;Hook's Church Dictionary. And see
  <i>Canon</i> in the New E. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>There were several other orders, such as the Gilbertine Canons of
  Sempringham in Lincolnshire, the Praemonstratenses or <i>White</i>
  Canons, &amp;c. See also the description of them in Cutts's Scenes and
  Characters of the Middle Ages, p. 19; and see Rock, Church of our
  Fathers, ii. 79, 84. At the latter reference, Dr. Rock says:&mdash;'Some
  families of canons regular still require their members, whenever they go
  out of the house, to wear over their cassock <i>a linen surplice</i>, and
  above that a large, full, black canon's <i>cope</i>.'</p>

  <p>I should imagine, from the description of the Canon's house in l. 657,
  and from the general tenor of the Tale, that Chaucer's Canon was but a
  secular one. Still, their rule seems to have been less strict than that
  of the monks.</p>

  <p>558. I have omitted to note that E. has <i>wered a</i>, where all the
  other MSS. read <i>hadde a whyt</i>.</p>

  <p>561. <i>priked myles three</i>, ridden hard for three miles. The Canon
  and his yeoman may be supposed to have ridden rather fast for the first
  two miles; and then, finding they could not otherwise overtake <!-- Page
  417 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page417"></a>[417]</span>the
  pilgrims, they took to the best pace they could force out of their horses
  for three miles more.</p>

  <p>562. <i>yeman</i>, yeoman, attendant, servant. His face was all
  discoloured with blowing his master's fire (ll. 664-667), and he seems to
  have been the more honest man of the two. He is the teller of the Tale,
  and begins by describing himself; l. 720.</p>

  <p>565. 'He was all spotted with foam, so that he looked like a magpie.'
  The word <i>He</i> (like <i>his</i> in l. 566) refers to the Canon, whose
  clothing was <i>black</i> (l. 557); and the white spots of foam upon it
  gave him this appearance. The horse is denoted by <i>it</i> (l. 563), the
  word <i>hors</i> being neuter in the Oldest English. Most MSS. read
  <i>he</i> for <i>it</i> in l. 563, but there is nothing gained by it.
  <i>Flecked</i>, in the sense of 'spotted,' is still in use; see N. and Q.
  7 S. i. 507, ii. 96.</p>

  <p>566. <i>male tweyfold</i>, a double budget or leathern bag; see Prol.
  l. 694.</p>

  <p>571. Chaucer tells us that the Pardoner's hood, on the contrary, was
  <i>not</i> fastened to his cloak; see Prol. 680. Dr. Rock, in The Church
  of our Fathers, ii. 44, says:&mdash;'Sometimes the hood of the cope was
  not only sewed to it, but stitched all round, and not allowed to hang
  with the lower part free; in such instances, the hood was necessarily
  left on the cope and folded with it.'</p>

  <p>575. 'Rather faster than at a trot or a foot-pace.' Said ironically.
  Cf. Prol. 825.</p>

  <p>577. <i>clote-leef</i>, the leaf of a burdock. Cotgrave
  has&mdash;'<i>Lampourde</i>, f. the <i>Cloot</i> or great Burre.'
  Also&mdash;'<i>Glouteron</i>, m. The <i>Clote</i>, Burre Docke, or great
  Burre.' And again&mdash;'<i>Bardane</i>, f. the <i>Clote</i>, burre-dock,
  or great Burre.'</p>

  <p>In the Prompt. Parv. we find&mdash;'<i>Clote</i>, herbe; Lappa
  bardana, lappa rotunda.' In Wyclif's Version of the Bible, Hosea ix. 6,
  x. 8, we find <i>clote</i> or <i>cloote</i> where the Vulgate version has
  <i>lappa</i>. The Glossary to Cockayne's 'Leechdoms' explains A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>cl&#x101;te</i> as <i>Arctium lappa</i>, with numerous references. The
  A.&nbsp;S. <i>cl&#x101;te</i> is related to G. <i>Klette</i>, a bur, a
  burdock; O. H. G. <i>chletta</i>; Mid. Du. <i>kladde</i>.</p>

  <p>It is clear that <i>clote</i> originally meant the bur <i>itself</i>,
  just as the name of <i>bur-dock</i> has reference to the same. The
  <i>clote</i> is, accordingly, the <i>Arctium lappa</i>, or Common
  Burdock, obtaining its name from the <i>clotes</i> (i.&nbsp;e. burs or knobs)
  upon it; and one of the large leaves of this plant would be very suitable
  for the purpose indicated.</p>

  <p>We may safely dismiss the suggestion in Halliwell's Dictionary,
  founded on a passage in Gerarde's Herball, p. 674 D, that the
  <i>Clote</i> here means the yellow water-lily. We know from Cockayne's
  'Leechdoms' that the name <i>cl&#x101;te s&#x113;o þe swimman wille</i>
  (i.&nbsp;e. swimming clote) was sometimes used for that flower (<i>Nuphar
  lutea</i>), either on account of its large round leaves or its globose
  flowers; but in the present passage we have only to remember the Canon's
  haste to feel assured, that he might much more easily have caught up a
  burdock-leaf from the road-side than have searched in a ditch for a
  water-lily. <!-- Page 418 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page418"></a>[418]</span></p>

  <p>578. <i>For swoot</i>, to prevent sweat, to keep off the heat. See
  note to Sir Thopas, B. 2052.</p>

  <p>580. It is probable that <i>stillatorie</i> (now shortened to
  <i>still</i>) is really a shortened form of <i>distillatorie</i>. Both
  forms occur in the Book of Quintessence, p. 10, l. 24, p. 13, l. 10.</p>

  <p>581. <i>Were ful</i>, that might be full, that might chance to be
  full. <i>Were</i> is the subjunctive, and the relative is omitted.</p>

  <p>588. <i>now</i>, &amp;c.; lately, in the time of early morning.</p>

  <p>589. This shews that the pilgrims had rested all night on the road;
  see note to l. 555 above.</p>

  <p>597. <i>oght</i>, in any way, at all. Cf. Kn. Ta., A. 3045; and
  Prioresses Tale, B. 1792.</p>

  <p>599. <i>ye</i>, yea. There is a difference between <i>ye</i>, yea, and
  <i>yis</i>, yes. The former merely assents, or answers a simple question
  in the affirmative. The latter is much more forcible, is used when the
  question involves a negative, and is often followed by an oath. See note
  to Specimens of Eng. 1394-1579, ed. Skeat, sect. xvii. (D), l. 22; and
  note to <i>&#x21D;is</i> in the Glossary to my edition of William of
  Palerne. See an example of <i>&#x21D;us</i> (yes) after a negative in
  Piers the Plowman, B. v. 125. Similarly, <i>nay</i> is the weaker,
  <i>no</i> the stronger form of negation.</p>

  <p>602. A note in Bell's edition makes a difficulty of the scansion of
  this line. It is perfectly easy. The caesura (carefully <i>marked</i> in
  MS. E. as occurring after <i>knewe</i>) preserves the final <i>e</i> in
  <i>knewe</i> from elision.</p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt reads <i>also</i> for the former <i>as</i>; which is
  legitimate, because <i>as</i> and <i>also</i> are merely different
  spellings of the same word.</p>

  <p>It is true that the final <i>e</i> in <i>wondre</i>, and again that in
  <i>werke</i>, are both elided, under similar circumstances, in the two
  lines next following; but the cases are not quite identical. The <i>e</i>
  in <i>knewe</i>, representing not merely the plural, but also the
  subjunctive mood, is essential to the conditional form of the sentence,
  and is of much higher value than the others. If this argument be not
  allowed, Tyrwhitt's suggestion may be adopted. Or we may read
  <i>knewen</i>.</p>

  <p>608. <i>rit</i>, contracted from <i>rideth</i>; see A. 974, 981. See
  also <i>slit</i> for <i>slideth</i> in l. 682 below.</p>

  <p>611. <i>leye in balaunce</i>, place in the balance, weigh against
  it.</p>

  <p>620. <i>can</i>, knows, knows how to exercise.</p>

  <p>622. The Yeoman puts in a word for himself&mdash;'and moreover, I am
  of some assistance to him.'</p>

  <p>625. <i>up-so-doun</i>, i.&nbsp;e. upside doun, according to our modern
  phrase. Chaucer's phrase is very common; see Pricke of Conscience, ed.
  Morris, l. 7230; P. Plowman, B. xx. 53; Gower, Conf. Amantis, i. 218,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>628. <i>benedicite</i>, pronounced <i>ben'cite</i>, in three
  syllables, as in B. 1170, 1974. See note to B. 1170.</p>

  <p>632. <i>worship</i>, dignity, honour; here, respectable
  appearance.</p>

  <p>633. <i>oversloppe</i>, upper garment. So in Icelandic,
  <i>yfirsloppr</i> means <!-- Page 419 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page419"></a>[419]</span>an outer gown; as, 'prestar skrýddir
  yfirsloppum,' i.&nbsp;e. priests clad in over-slops, Historia Ecclesiastica,
  i. 473. The word <i>slop</i> is preserved in the somewhat vulgar
  '<i>slop</i><span class="nw">-shop,'</span> i.&nbsp;e. shop for second-hand
  clothes.</p>

  <p>635. <i>baudy</i>, dirty. <i>to-tore</i>, torn in half. So in Piers
  Plowman, B. v. 197, Avarice is described as wearing a 'tabard' which is
  'al to-torn and baudy.'</p>

  <p>639. The second person sing. imperative seldom exhibits a final
  <i>e</i>; but it is sometimes found in weak verbs, <i>tellen</i> being
  one of them. The readings are&mdash;<i>Telle</i>, E. Cp. Pt. Hl.;
  <i>Tel</i>, Ln. Cm. Elsewhere, we find <i>tel</i>, as in D. 1298.</p>

  <p>641. <i>for</i>, &amp;c.; because he shall never thrive. The Yeoman
  blurts out the truth, and is then afraid he has said too much. In l. 644,
  he gives an evasive and politer reason, declaring that his lord is 'too
  wise'; see l. 648.</p>

  <p>645. <i>That that</i>, that which. In the margin of MS. E. is
  written&mdash;'Omne quod est nimium, &amp;c.'; which is probably short
  for&mdash;'Omne quod est nimium uertitur in uitium.' We also
  find&mdash;'Omne nimium nocet.' The corresponding English proverb
  is&mdash;'Too much of one thing is not good' (Heywood); on which Ray
  remarks&mdash;'Assez y a si trop n'y a; <i>French</i>. Ne quid nimis;
  <i>Terentius</i>. <span title="Mêden agan." class="grk"
  >&Mu;&eta;&delta;&#x1F72;&nu; &#x1F04;&gamma;&alpha;&nu;.</span> This is
  an apothegm of one of the seven wise men; some attribute it to Thales,
  some to Solon. Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines;
  <i>Horat.</i> Sat. i. 1. 106. L'abbondanza delle cose ingenera fastidio;
  <i>Ital.</i> Cada dia olla, amargo el caldo; <i>Spanish</i>.' We also
  find in Hazlitt's English Proverbs&mdash;'Too much cunning
  undoes.'&mdash;'Too much is stark nought.'&mdash;'Too much of a good
  thing.'&mdash;'Too much spoileth, too little is nothing.' See also the
  collection of similar proverbs in Ida v. Düringsfeld's Sprichwörter, i.
  37, 38.</p>

  <p>652. <i>Ther-of no fors</i>, never mind about that.</p>

  <p>655. The adj. <i>sly</i> here appears in the indefinite form, and
  rimes with <i>hertely</i>; correctly. Lounsbury (Studies, i. 388) admits
  the fact, but immediately proceeds to rate Chaucer for using the form
  <i>dry-e</i> (dissyllabic) as an indefinite form! The attack, being
  founded on an error, ignominiously fails. It so happens that <i>sly</i>
  is, etymologically, a monosyllable, whilst <i>drye</i> is etymologically
  dissyllabic; see <i>sleh</i> and <i>druye</i> in Stratmann.</p>

  <p>658. A <i>blind lane</i> is one that has no opening at the farther
  end; a <i>cul de sac</i>.</p>

  <p>659. <i>theves by kinde</i>, thieves by natural disposition.</p>

  <p>662. <i>the sothe</i>, the truth. The reader should carefully note the
  full pronunciation of the final <i>e</i> in <i>sothe</i>. If he should
  omit to sound it, he will be put to shame when he comes to the end of the
  next line, ending with <i>tó thee</i>. A very similar instance is that of
  <i>tyme</i>, riming with <i>bý me</i>, G. 1204 below. The case is the
  more remarkable because <!-- Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page420"></a>[420]</span>the A.&nbsp;S. <i>s&#x14D;ð</i>, truth, is a
  monosyllable; but the truth is that the definite adjective <i>the
  sothe</i> (A. S. <i>þæt s&#x14D;ðe</i>) may very well have supplied its
  place, the adjective being more freely used than the substantive in this
  instance. Chaucer has <i>sothe</i> at the end of a line in other places,
  where it rimes with the dissyllabic <i>bothe</i>; G. 168; Troil. iv.
  1035.</p>

  <p>We may remark that <i>the sothe</i> is written and pronounced instead
  of <i>the sooth</i> (as shewn by the metre) in the Story of Genesis and
  Exodus, ed. Morris, l. 74:&mdash;</p>

  <p>665. <i>Peter!</i> by St. Peter; as in B. 1404, D. 446. The full form
  of the phrase&mdash;'bi seynt Peter of Rome'&mdash;occurs in Piers the
  Plowman, B. vi. 3. The shorter exclamation&mdash;'Peter!' also occurs in
  the same, B. v. 544; see my note on that line. <i>harde grace</i>,
  disfavour, ill-favour; a mild imprecation. In l. 1189, it expresses a
  mild malediction.</p>

  <p>669. <i>multiplye.</i> This was the technical term employed by
  alchemists to denote their supposed power of transmuting the baser metals
  into gold; they thought to <i>multiply</i> gold by turning as much base
  metal as a piece of it would buy into gold itself; see l. 677. Some such
  pun seems here intended; yet it is proper to remember that the term
  originally referred solely to the supposed fact, that the strength of an

  century. It was extremely popular, not only in Latin, but in French and

<p class="ac"><b>The Chanouns Yemannes Tale.</b></p>

  <p>720. This Tale is divided, in MS. E., into two parts. <i>Pars
  prima</i> is not really a tale at all, but a description of alchemy and
  its professors. The real tale, founded on the same subject, is contained
  in <i>Pars Secunda</i>, beginning at l. 972. The rubric means&mdash;'Here
  the Canon's Yeoman begins his tale.' The word <i>tale</i> is not to be
  taken as a nominative case.</p>

  <p>I may observe that I frequently refer below to the Theatrum Chemicum,
  printed in 1659, in five volumes. Also to Ashmole's Theatrum Chemicum
  (quite a different work).</p>

  <p>721. <i>neer</i>, nearer; this explains <i>near</i> in Macbeth, ii. 3.
  146.</p>

  <p>724. <i>Ther</i>, where; observe the use. In l. 727, we have
  <i>wher</i>.</p>

  <p>726. <i>hose</i>, an old hose, instead of a hood. A pair of hose meant
  what we should now call a pair of tight-fitting drawers, which also
  covered the feet.</p>

  <p>730. 'And, in return for all my labour, I am cajoled.' To
  '<i>blere</i> one's eye' is to cajole, to deceive, to hoodwink. See Piers
  the Plowman, B. prol. 74, and the note.</p>

  <p>731. <i>which</i>, what sort of a; Lat. <i>qualis</i>. On
  <i>multiplye</i>, see note to l. 669.</p>

  <p>739. 'I consider his prosperity as done with.'</p>

  <p>743. <i>Iupartye</i>, jeopardy, hazard. Tyrwhitt remarks that the
  derivation is not from <i>jeu perdu</i>, as some have guessed, but from
  <i>jeu parti</i>. He adds&mdash;'A <i>jeu parti</i> is properly a game,
  in which the chances are exactly even; see Froissart, v. i. c.
  234&mdash;"Ils n'estoient pas à <i>jeu parti</i> contre les François";
  and v. ii. c. 9&mdash;"si nous les voyons à <i>jeu parti</i>." From hence
  it signifies anything uncertain or hazardous. In the old French poetry,
  the discussion of a problem, where much might be said on both sides, was
  called a <i>Jeu parti</i>. See Poésies du Roy de Navarre, Chanson
  xlviii., and <i>Gloss.</i> in v. See also Ducange, in v. <i>Jocus
  Partitus</i>.' Ducange has&mdash;'<i>Jocus partitus</i> dicebatur, cum
  alicui facultas concedebatur, alterum e duobus propositis eligendi.'
  Hence was formed not only <i>jeopardy</i>, but even the verb to
  <i>jeopard</i>, used in the A. V., Judges v. 18; 2 Macc. xi. 7.</p>

  <p>746. In the margin of MS. E. is written&mdash;'Solacium miseriorum
  (<i>sic</i>), &amp;c.' In Marlowe's Faustus, ii. 1. 42, the proverb is
  quoted in the form 'Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris.' Dr. Wagner
  says: 'The purport of this line may have been originally derived from
  Seneca, De Consol. ad Polybium, xii. 2: est autem hoc ipsum solatii loco,
  inter multos dolorem suum diuidere; qui quia dispensatur inter plures,
  exigua debet apud te parte subsidere.' Cf. Milton, P. R. i. 398. The idea
  is that conveyed in the fable of the Fox who had lost his tail, and
  wished to persuade the other foxes to cut theirs off likewise. See Troil.
  i. 708.</p>

  <p>752. 'The technical terms which we use are so learned and fine.' See
  this well illustrated in Jonson's Alchemist, ii. 1:&mdash;'What else are
  all your terms,' &amp;c. <!-- Page 422 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page422"></a>[422]</span></p>

  <p>764. <i>lampe</i>; so in the MSS. It is clearly put for <i>lambe</i>,
  a corruption of O. Fr. <i>lame</i>, Lat. <i>lamina</i>. Were there any
  MS. authority, it would be better to read <i>lame</i> at once. Cotgrave
  has&mdash;'<i>Lame</i>; f. a thin plate of any metall; also, a blade.'
  &amp;c. Nares has&mdash;'<i>Lamm</i>, s. a plate, from Lat.
  <i>lamina</i>. "But he strake Phalantus just upon the gorget, so as he
  batred the <i>lamms</i> thereof, and make his head almost touch the back
  of his horse"; Pembr. Arcadia, lib. iii. p. 269.' <i>Lame</i> in old
  French also means, the flat slab covering a tomb; see Godefroy. So here,
  after the ingredients have all been placed in a pot, they are covered
  over with a plate of glass laid flat upon the top.</p>

  <p>It is strange that no editor has made any attempt to explain this
  word. It obviously does not mean <i>lamp</i>! For the insertion of the
  <i>p</i>, cf. <i>solempne</i> for <i>solemne</i>, and <i>nempne</i> for
  <i>nemne</i>; also <i>flambe</i> for <i>flame</i>; see the Glossary.</p>

  <p>766. <i>enluting.</i> To <i>enlute</i> is to close with <i>lute</i>.
  Webster has&mdash;'<i>Lute</i>, n. (Lat. <i>lutum</i>, mud, clay). A
  composition of clay or other tenacious substance, used for stopping the
  juncture of vessels so closely as to prevent the escape or entrance of
  air, or to protect them when exposed to heat.'</p>

  <p>The process is minutely described in a MS. by Sir George Erskine, of
  Innertiel (temp. James I.), printed by Mr. J. Small in the Proceedings of
  the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. xi. 1874-75, p. 193, as
  follows:&mdash;'Thairfoir when all the matter which must be in, is
  gathered together into the pot, tak a good <i>lute</i> maid of potters
  clay, and mix it with bolus and rust of iron tempered with whitts of eggs
  and chopt hair, and mingle and worke thame weill togither, and lute
  &#x21D;oure pott ane inch thick thairwith, and mak a stopple of potters
  earth weill brunt, to shut close in the hole that is in the top of the
  cover of the pott, and lute the pott and the cover very close togither,
  so as no ayre may brek furth, and when any craks cum into it, in the
  drying of the lute, dawbe them up againe; and when the lute is perfectly
  drie in the sunne, then take a course linen or canvas, and soke it weill
  in the whitts of eggs mixt with iron rust, and spred this cloth round
  about the luting, and then wet it weill again with whitts of eggs and
  upon the luting'; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>768. The alchemists were naturally very careful about the heat of the
  fire. So in The Alchemist, ii. 1:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>770. <i>matires sublyming</i>, sublimation of materials. To
  'sublimate' is to render vaporous, to cause matter to pass into a state
  of vapour by the application of heat. 'Philosophi considerantes eorum
  materiam, quae est in vase suo, et calorem sentit, evaporatur in speciem
  fumi, et <!-- Page 423 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>771. <i>amalgaming.</i> To 'amalgamate' is to compound or mix
  intimately, especially used of mixing quicksilver with other metals. The
  term is still in use; thus 'an <i>amalgam</i> of tin' means a mixture of
  tin and quicksilver.</p>

  <p><i>calcening.</i> To 'calcine' is to reduce a metal to an oxide, by
  the action of heat. What is now called an oxide was formerly called 'a
  metallic calx'; hence the name. The term is here applied to quicksilver
  or mercury. For example&mdash;'When mercury is heated, and at the same
  time exposed to atmospheric air, it is found that the volume of the air
  is diminished, and the weight of the mercury increased, and that it
  becomes, during the operation, a red crystalline body, which is the
  binoxide of mercury, formed by the metal combining with the oxygen of the
  air'; English Cyclopaedia, Div. Arts and Sciences, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Oxygen</i>.
  'The alchemists used to keep mercury at a boiling heat for a month or
  longer in a matrass, or a flask with a tolerably long neck, having free
  communication with the air. It thus slowly absorbed oxygen, becoming
  converted into binoxide, and was called by them <i>mercurius precipitatus
  per se</i>. It is now however generally prepared by calcination from
  mercuric nitrate'; id., s.&nbsp;v. <i>Mercury</i>.</p>

  <p>772. <i>Mercurie crude</i>, crude Mercury. See note to l. 820. See the
  description of Mercury in Ashmole's Theat. Chem. p. 272. The alchemists
  pretended that <i>their</i> quicksilver, which they called the Green
  Lion, was something different from quicksilver as ordinarily found. See
  treatise on 'The Greene Lyon,' in Ashmole's Theat. Chem. p. 280.</p>

  <p>774. Note the accents&mdash;'súblyméd Mercúrie.'</p>

  <p>778. Here the 'ascension of spirits' refers to the rising of gases or
  vapours from certain substances; and the 'matters that lie all fix adown'
  are the materials that lie at the bottom in a fixed (i.&nbsp;e. in a solid)
  state. There were four substances in particular which were technically
  termed 'spirits'; viz. sulphur, sal ammoniac, quicksilver, and arsenic,
  or (as some said) orpiment. See Theatrum Chemicum, iii. 81, 129; ii. 430;
  iii. 276.</p>

  <p>782. Here <i>a</i> = in; being short for <i>an</i>, a variant of
  <i>on</i>, used in the old sense of 'in.' The expression signifies,
  literally, in the way to (or of) twenty devils; see note to A. 3713.</p>

  <p>790. <i>bole armoniak.</i> The latter word should rather be
  <i>Armeniak</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Armenian, but we have <i>armoniak</i> again below,
  in l. 798; see note to that line.</p>

  <p>'<i>Bole</i>, a kind of fine, compact, or earthy clay, often highly
  coloured with iron, and varying in shades of colour from white to
  yellowish, <!-- Page 424 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page424"></a>[424]</span>reddish, blueish, and brownish. Fr.
  <i>bol</i>, Lat. <i>bolus</i>, Gk. <span title="bôlos" class="grk"
  >&beta;&#x1FF6;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, a clod or lump of
  earth'; Webster's Dict., ed. Goodrich and Porter. Cotgrave
  has&mdash;'<i>Bol</i>, m. the astringent and medicinable red earth or
  minerall called <i>Bolearmenie</i> ... <i>Bol Oriental</i>, et <i>Bol
  Armenien Oriental</i>, Oriental Bolearmenie; the best and truest kind of
  Bolearmenie, ministred with good effect against all poisons, and in
  pestilent diseases; and more red than the ordinary one, which should
  rather be tearmed Sinopian red earth than Bolearmeny.' And see
  <i>Bole</i> in the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>Mr. Paget Toynbee has lately shewn (in The Academy, Sept. 16, 1893)
  that <i>verdegrees</i> is from the O. Fr. <i>verd de Grece</i>, lit.
  'green of Greece.' Cotgrave has the curious form <i>verderis</i>, which
  probably represents the Latin <i>viride aeris</i>, the green of brass.
  This term (<i>viride aeris</i>) is the common one in the old Latin
  treatises on alchemy. See the chapter in Albertus Magnus&mdash;'Quomodo
  viride aeris fit, et quomodo rubificatur, et super omnia valet ad artem
  istam'; Theatrum Chemicum, ii. 436. It is the bibasic acetate of
  copper.</p>

  <p>792, 794. Perhaps Chaucer had read the following lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p style="margin-left:2.4em">'Par <i>alambics</i> et <i>descensoires</i>,</p>
      <p style="margin-left:2.6em"><i>Cucurbites</i>, distillatoires.'</p>
      <p>Les Remonstrances de Nature, par J. de Meung, ll. 39,40.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>794. <i>Cucurbites</i>, vessels supposed to bear some resemblance to a
  gourd, whence the name (Lat. <i>cucurbita</i>, a gourd). 'Cucurbita est
  uas quod debet stare in aqua, usque ad juncturam firmatum in caldario, ut
  non moueatur'; Theatrum Chemicum, ii. 452.</p>

  <p>795. <i>dere y-nough a leek</i>, dear enough at the price of a leek.
  Cf. Clerkes Tale, E. 999.</p>

  <p>797. <i>Watres rubifying</i>, reddening waters. This is well
  illustrated by a long passage in The Boke of Quinte Essence, ed.
  Furnivall, p. 13, where instructions are given for extracting the
  quintessence out of the four elements. After various processes, we are
  directed to put the vessel into 'the fier of flawme right strong, and the
  <i>reed water</i> schal ascende'; and again&mdash;'thanne yn the
  stillatorie, to the fier of bath, cleer water schall asende; and in the
  botum shall remayne the <i>reed water</i>, that is, the element of fier.'
  A long and unintelligible passage about 'rubrificatio' and 'aqua
  spiritualis rubea' occurs in the Theatrum Chemicum, iii. 41. See also
  'modus rubrificandi' and the recipe for 'aqua rubea'; id. iii. 110.</p>

  <p>798. <i>Arsenic</i> was by some considered as one of the 'four
  spirits'; see note to l. 778. For a long passage 'de arsenico,' see
  Theatrum Chemicum, iii. 177; also p. 110, and ii. 238. <i>Sal
  armoniacum</i> was another of them (see l. 824) and is constantly
  mentioned in the old treatises; see 'praeparatio salis Armoniaci secundum
  Rasim'; Theat. Chem. iii. 179; also pp. 89, 94, 102; ii. 445. In vol. ii.
  p. 138 of the same work, it is twice called '<i>sal armeniacum</i>.' See
  the account of <i>sal ammoniac</i> in Thomson, Hist. of Chemistry, i.
  124. <i>Brimstoon</i> was also a 'spirit' (see l. 824); it is only
  another name for sulphur. <!-- Page 425 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page425"></a>[425]</span></p>

  <p>800. <i>egrimoine</i>, common agrimony, <i>Ægrimonia officinalis</i>;
  valerian, <i>Valeriana officinalis</i>; <i>lunarie</i>, a kind of fern
  called in English moonwort, <i>Botrychium lunaria</i>. The belief in the
  virtue of herbs was very strong; cf. Spenser, (F.&nbsp;Q. i. 2. 10). The root
  of valerian yields valerianic acid. The following quotation is from the
  English Encyclopaedia, s.&nbsp;v. <i>Botrychium</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>'In former times the ferns had a great reputation in medicine, not so
  much on account of their obvious as their supposed virtues. The lunate
  shape of the pinnæ of this fern (<i>B. lunaria</i>) gave it its common
  name, and was the origin of much of the superstitious veneration with
  which it was regarded. When used it was gathered by the light of the
  moon. Gerarde says&mdash;"it is singular [i.&nbsp;e. sovereign] to heal green
  and fresh wounds. It hath been used among the <i>alchymists and
  witches</i> to do wonders withall."'</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Ashmole's Theatrum Chemicum, p. 348, is a full description of
  'lunayrie,' with an engraving of it. It is there also called
  <i>asterion</i>, and we are told that its root is black, its stalk red,
  and its leaves round; and moreover, that the leaves <i>wax and wane with
  the moon</i>, and on each of them is a mark of the breadth of a penny.
  See also pp. 315, 318 of the same work.</p>

  <p>805. <i>albificacioun</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the rendering the water of a white
  colour, as distinguishing from the reddening of it, mentioned in l. 797.
  In a long chapter printed in the Theatrum Chemicum (iii. 634-648) much is
  said about red and white colours. Compare the Alchemist, ii.

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>No doubt, too, <i>water</i> is here used in the sense of the Lat.
  <i>aqua</i>, to denote any substance that is in a liquid state.</p>

  <p>808. <i>Cered pokets.</i> Tyrwhitt reads <i>Sered pokettes</i>, and
  includes this phrase in his short 'List of Phrases not understood'; and
  indeed, it has never been explained. But there is little difficulty about
  it. <i>Poket</i> is the diminutive of <i>poke</i>, a bag, and means a
  little bag. <i>Cered</i> (Lat. <i>ceratus</i>) means waxed. Thus Cotgrave
  has&mdash;'<i>Ciré</i>, m. <i><span class="nw">-ée</span></i>, f. waxed,
  <i>seared</i>; dressed, covered, closed, or mingled, with wax.' In many
  MSS. the word is spelt <i>sered</i>, but this makes no difference, since
  Cotgrave has 'seared' in this very place. So we find both 'cere-cloth'
  and 'sear-cloth.' It is obvious that bags or cases prepared or closed
  with wax would be useful for many of the alchemist's purposes; see Theat.
  Chem. iii. 13.</p>

  <p><i>sal peter</i>, Lat. <i>sal petrae</i>, or rock-salt, also called
  <i>nitre</i>, is nitrate of potassa. A recipe for preparing it is given
  in Theat. Chem. iii. 195.</p>

  <p><i>vitriole</i>, i.&nbsp;e. sulphuric acid. See 'vitrioli praeparatio';
  Theat. Chem. iii. 95.</p>

  <p>810. <i>Sal tartre</i>, salt of tartar, i.&nbsp;e. carbonate of potash; so
  called from its having been formerly prepared from cream of tartar.</p>

  <p><i>sal preparat</i>, common salt prepared in a certain manner. See the
  <!-- Page 426 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>812. <i>maad</i>, i.&nbsp;e. prepared, mixed. <i>oile of tartre</i>, oil of

  <p>813. <i>argoile</i>, crude cream of tartar deposited as a hard crust
  on wine-casks. Called <i>argoil</i> in Anglo-French; Liber Albus, i. 225,
  231.</p>

  <p>814. <i>resalgar</i>, realgar, red orpiment, or the red sulphuret of
  arsenic; symbol (As S<sub>2</sub>); found native in some parts of Europe,
  and of a brilliant red colour. <i>Resalgar</i> is adapted from the old
  Latin name, <i>risigallum</i>. The word is explained by Thynne in his
  Animadversions, ed. Furnivall, p. 36&mdash;'This <i>resalgar</i> is that
  whiche by some is called Ratesbane, a kynde of poysone named
  Arsenicke.'</p>

  <p><i>enbibing</i>, imbibition; see this term used in The Alchemist, ii.
  1. It means absorption; cf. Theat. Chem. iii. 132, l. 27.</p>

  <p>816. <i>citrinacioun.</i> This also is explained by Thynne, who says
  (p. 38)&mdash;'Citrinatione is bothe a coolor [colour] and parte of the
  philophers stoone.' He then proceeds to quote from a Tractatus Avicennae,
  cap. 7, and from Arnoldus de Nova Villa, lib. i. cap. 5. It was supposed
  that when the materials for making the philosopher's stone had been
  brought into a state very favourable to the ultimate success of the
  experiment, they would assume the colour of a citron; or, as Thynne says,
  Arnold speaks of 'this citrinatione, perfecte digestione, or the coolor
  provinge the philosophers stoone broughte almoste to the heighte of his

  Alchymye, deduced from the bakers fermente or levyne'; &amp;c. See Theat.
  Chem. ii. 115, 175.</p>

  <p>Gower enumerates the seven bodies and the four spirits; and further
  explains that gold and silver are the two 'extremities,' and the other
  metals agree with one or other of them more or less, so as to be capable
  of transmutation into one of them. For this purpose, the <!-- Page 427
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page427"></a>[427]</span>alchemist must
  go through the processes of distillation, congelation, solution,
  descension, sublimation, calcination, and fixation, after which he will
  obtain the perfect elixir of the philosopher's stone. He adds that there
  are really three philosopher's stones, one vegetable, capable of healing
  diseases; another animal, capable of assisting each of the five senses of
  man; and the third mineral, capable of transforming the baser metals into
  silver and gold.</p>

  <p>It is easy to see how the various metals were made to answer to the
  seven planets. <i>Gold</i>, the chief of metals and yellow, of course
  answered to the <i>sun</i>; and similarly <i>silver</i>, to the paler
  moon. <i>Mercury</i>, the swiftest planet, must be the shifty
  <i>quicksilver</i>; Saturn, the slowest, of cold and dull influence, must
  be <i>lead</i>. The etymology of <i>copper</i> suggested the connexion
  with the <i>Cyprian</i> Venus. This left but two metals, iron and tin, to
  be adjusted; iron was suggestive of Mars, the god of war, leaving tin to
  Jupiter. The notion of thus naming the metals is attributed to Geber; see
  Thomson, Hist. of Chemistry, i. 117. In the Book of Quinte Essence, ed.
  Furnivall, p. 8, we find: 'a plate of <i>venus</i> or <i>Iubiter</i>,'
  i.&nbsp;e. of copper or tin.</p>

  <p>Quicksilver, be it observed, is still called <i>mercury</i>; and
  nitrate of <i>silver</i> is still <i>lunar</i> caustic. Gold and silver
  are constantly termed <i>sol</i> and <i>luna</i> in the old treatises on
  alchemy. See further allusions in Chaucer's House of Fame, 1431-1487, as
  pointed out in the notes to ll. 1431, 1450, 1457, 1487 of that poem.</p>

  <p>834. 'Whosoever pleases to utter (i.&nbsp;e. display) his folly.'</p>

  <p>838. <i>Ascaunce</i>, possibly, perhaps; lit. 'just as if.' See note
  to D. 1745.</p>

  <p>846. <i>Al conne he</i>, whether he know. The use of <i>al</i> at the
  beginning of a sentence containing a supposition is common in Chaucer;
  see Prol. 734. Cf. <i>al be</i>, Prol. 297; Kn. Tale, 313 (A. 1171). And
  see l. 861 below.</p>

  <p>848. <i>bothe two</i>, both learned and unlearned alike.</p>

  <p>853. <i>limaille</i>, filings, fine scrapings. 'Take fyn gold and make
  it into smal <i>lymail</i>'; Book of Quinte Essence, p. 8.</p>

  <p>861. 'To raise a fiend, though he look never so rough,' i.&nbsp;e.
  forbidding, cross.</p>

  <p>874. <i>it is to seken euer</i>, it is always to seek, i.&nbsp;e. never
  found. In Skelton's Why Come Ye Nat to Court, l. 314, the phrase 'they
  are to seke' means 'they are at a loss'; this latter is the commoner
  use.</p>

  <p>875. <i>temps</i>, tense. The editors explain it by 'time.' If Chaucer
  had <i>meant</i> time, it is reasonable to suppose that he would have
  <i>said</i> so. Surely it is better to take 'that futur temps' in the
  special sense of 'that future tense.' The allusion is to the phrase 'to
  seken' in the last line, which is not an infinitive mood but a gerund,
  and often used as a future tense, as Chaucer very well knew. Compare the
  A.&nbsp;S. version of Matt. xi. 3&mdash;'eart þ&#x16B; þe to cumenne
  eart'&mdash;with the Lat. 'Tu es qui <i>uenturus</i> es.'</p>

  <p>878. <i>bitter swete</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a fatal, though alluring, pursuit. An
  example <!-- Page 428 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page428"></a>[428]</span>of oxymoron; cf. 'insaniens sapientia,'
  Horat. Carm. i. 34; 'strenua inertia,' Epist. i. xi. 28. Cf. the
  plant-name <i>bittersweet</i> (<i>Solanum dulcamara</i>).</p>

  <p>879. <i>nadde they but</i>, if they only should have (<i>or</i>, were
  to have). <i>Nadde</i> is for <i>ne hadde</i>, past tense
  subjunctive.</p>

  <p>880. <i>inne</i>, within; A. S. <i>innan</i>; see l. 881.
  <i>a-night</i>, for <i>on night</i>, in the night. Perhaps it should be
  <i>nighte</i> (with final <i>e</i>), and <i>lighte</i> in l. 881.</p>

  <p>881. <i>bak</i>, cloth; any rough sort of covering for the back. So in
  most MSS.; altered in E. to <i>brat</i>, but unnecessarily. That the word
  <i>bak</i> was used in the sense of garment is quite certain; see William
  of Palerne, ed. Skeat, l. 2096; Piers the Plowman, B. x. 362; and the
  same, A. xi. 184.</p>

  <p>Pronounce the words <i>And a</i> rapidly, in the time of one
  syllable.</p>

  <p>907. <i>to-brek'th</i>, bursts in pieces. <i>go</i>, gone. This must
  have been a very common result; the old directions about 'luting' and
  hermetically sealing the vessels employed are so strict, that every care
  seems to have been (unwittingly) taken to secure an explosion; see note
  to l. 766 above. So in the Alchemist, iv. 3:&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>921. <i>chit</i>, short for <i>chideth</i>; so also <i>halt</i> for
  <i>holdeth</i>.</p>

  <p>922. <i>Som seyde</i>, i.&nbsp;e. one said; note that <i>som</i> is here
  singular, as in Kn. Tale, 2173 (A. 3031). Hence the use of <i>the
  thridde</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the third, in l. 925.</p>

  <p>923. <i>Lungs</i> was a nickname for a fire-blower to an alchemist.
  See <i>Lungs</i> in Nares' Glossary.</p>

  <p>929. <i>so theech</i>, for <i>so thee ich</i>, so may I thrive. See
  Pard. Tale, C. 947.</p>

  <p>933. <i>eft-sone</i>, for the future; lit. soon afterwards.</p>

  <p>934. 'I am quite sure that the pot was cracked.'</p>

  <p>938. <i>mullok</i>, rubbish. This is a common provincial E. word; see
  (in the E. Dial. Society's Publications) Ray's Glossary, p. 57; and the
  Glossaries for Wilts., Hants., Lancashire, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>962. The reading <i>shyneth</i> is of course the right one. In the
  margin of MS. E. is written 'Non teneas aurum,' &amp;c. This proves that
  Tyrwhitt's note is quite correct. He says&mdash;'This is taken from the
  Parabolae of Alanus de Insulis, who died in 1294; see Leyser, Hist.
  Poetarum Medii Ævi, p. 1074.</p>

  <p>Shakespeare has&mdash;'All that glisters is not gold'; Merch. of

  that glisters (Heywood). See Chaucer, Chan. Yeom. Prol.; Roxburghe
  Ballads, ed. Collier, p. 102; Udall's Royster Doyster, 1566, where we

  <p>972. <i>Pars secunda.</i> This is where the Tale begins. Even now, the
  Yeoman has some more to say by way of preface, and only makes a real
  start at l. 1012.</p>

  <p>975. <i>Alisaundre</i>, Alexandria, <i>and othere three</i>, and three
  more as well.</p>

  <p>999. <i>I mente</i>, I intended; as in l. 1051 below. 'But my
  intention was to correct that which is amiss.'</p>

  <p>The reading <i>I-ment</i>, as a past participle, adopted by Mr.
  Wright, is incorrect, as shewn by Mr. Cromie's Ryme-Index. Cf. Nonne Pr.
  Tale, 604 (B. 4614); Sq. Tale, F. 108. See note to G. 534 above.</p>

  <p>1005. <i>by yow</i>, with reference to you canons. See <i>By</i> in
  Wright's Bible Word-book.</p>

  <p>1012. <i>annueleer.</i> So called, as Tyrwhitt explains, 'from their
  being employed solely in singing <i>annuals</i> or anniversary masses for
  the dead, without any cure of souls. See the Stat. 36 Edw. III. c. viii,
  where the <i>Chappelleins Parochiels</i> are distinguished from others
  <i>chantanz annuales, et a cure des almes nient entendantz</i>. They were
  both to receive yearly stipends, but the former was allowed to take six
  marks, the latter only five. Compare Stat. 2 Hen. V. St. 2. c. 2, where
  the stipend of the <i>Chapellein Parochiel</i> is raised to eight marks,
  and that of the <i>Chapellein annueler</i> (he is so named in the
  statute) to seven.' See also the note at p. 505 of Wyclif's Works, ed.
  Matthew (E. E. T. S.); and Monumenta Franciscana, p. 605.</p>

  <p>1015. That is, to the lady of the house where he lodged.</p>

  <p>1018. <i>spending-silver</i>, money to spend, ready money. The phrase
  occurs in Piers the Plowman, B. xi. 278.</p>

  <p>1024. <i>a certeyn</i>, a certain sum, a stated sum. Cf. l. 776.</p>

  <p>1027. <i>at my day</i>, on the day agreed upon, on the third day.</p>

  <p>1029. <i>Another day</i>, another time, on the next occasion.</p>

  <p>1030. <i>him took</i>, handed over to him; so in ll. 1034, 1112.</p>

  <p>1055. 'In some measure to requite your kindness.' See note to Sq.
  Tale, F. 471, and cf. l. 1151.</p>

  <p>1059. <i>seen at yë</i>, see evidently; lit. see at eye.</p>

  <p>1066. 'Proffered service stinketh' is among Heywood's Proverbs. Ray
  remarks on it&mdash;'Merx ultronea putet, <i>apud</i> Hieronymum. Erasmus
  saith, Quin uulgo etiam in ore est, ultro delatum obsequium plerumque
  ingratum esse. So that it seems this proverb is in use among the Dutch
  too. In French, Merchandise offerte est à demi vendue. Ware that is
  proffered is sold for half the worth, or at half the price.' The German
  is&mdash;'Angebotene Hülfe hat keinen Lohn'; see Ida v. Düringsfeld's
  Sprichwörter, i. 86.</p>

  <p>1096. <i>Algates</i>, at any rate. Observe the context. <!-- Page 430
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page430"></a>[430]</span></p>

  <p>1103. <i>that we it hadde</i>, that we might have it. <i>Hadde</i> is
  here the subjunctive. Perhaps <i>have</i> would be better, but it lacks
  authority.</p>

  <p>1126. <i>mortifye</i>, mortify; a technical term. See note to l.
  1431.</p>

  <p>1151. 'To blind the priest with.' See note to l. 1055.</p>

  <p>1171. For <i>torned</i>, read <i>terved</i>, i.&nbsp;e. flayed, skinned;
  MS. E. has <i>terued</i> (so it may be read). See l. 1274.</p>

  <p>1185. <i>Seint Gyles</i>, saint Giles; a corrupted form of Ægidius.
  His day is Sept. 1; see Chambers' Book of Days, ii. 296; Legenda Aurea,
  cap. cxxx.; or Caxton's Golden Legende.</p>

  <p>1204-1205. The rime is given by <i>týmë</i> (two syllables, from A. S.
  <i>t&#x12B;ma</i>) riming with <i>by me</i>.</p>

  <p>On referring to Prof. Child's Observations on the Language of Gower, I
  find <i>seven</i> references given for this rime, as occurring in the
  edition by Dr. Pauli. The references are&mdash;i. 227, 309, 370; ii. 41,
  114, 277; iii. 369. Dr. Pauli prints <i>byme</i> as one word!</p>

  <p>1210. The last foot contains the words&mdash;or a pannë.</p>

  <p>1238-1239. MS. E. omits these two lines: the other MSS. retain
  them.</p>

  <p>1244. <i>halwes</i> is in the genitive plural. 'And the blessing of
  all the saints may ye have, Sir Canon!'</p>

  <p>1245. 'And may I have their malison,' i.&nbsp;e. their curse.</p>

  <p>1274. For <i>torne</i>, read <i>terve</i>, i.&nbsp;e. flay; as in MS. E.
  Cf. l. 1171.</p>

  <p>1283. 'Why do you wish it to be better than well?' Answering nearly
  to&mdash;'what would you have better?'</p>

  <p>1292. A rather lax line. <i>Is ther</i> is to be pronounced rapidly,
  in the time of one syllable, and <i>her-inne</i> is of three
  syllables.</p>

  <p>1299. Pronounce <i>simple</i> as <i>simpl'</i>; <i>tong-e</i> is
  dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>1313. <i>his ape</i>, his dupe. See Prol. 706, B. 1630. The simile is
  evidently taken from the fact that showmen used to carry apes about with
  them much as organ-boys do at the present day, the apes being secured by
  a string. Thus, 'to make a man one's ape' is to lead him about at will.
  The word <i>apewarde</i> occurs in Piers the Plowman, B. v. 540. To
  <i>lead apes</i> means to lead about a train of dupes.</p>

  <p>1319. <i>heyne</i>, wretch. This word has never before been properly
  explained. It is not in Tyrwhitt's Glossary. Dr. Morris considers it as
  another form of <i>hyne</i>, a peasant, or hind, but leaves the phonetic
  difference of vowel unaccounted for; the words are clearly distinct. It
  occurs in Skelton's Bowge of Courte, l. 327:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'It is great scorne to see suche an <i>hayne</i></p>
      <p>As thou arte, one that cam but yesterdaye,</p>
      <p>With vs olde seruauntes suche maysters to playe.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here Mr. Dyce also explains it by <i>hind</i>, or servant, whereas the
  context requires the opposite meaning of a despised <i>master</i>.
  Halliwell gives&mdash;'<i>Heyne</i>, a miser, a worthless person'; but
  without a reference. It means 'miser' in Udall's translation of Erasmus'
  Apophthegmes (1564), where it occurs thrice. Thus, in bk. i. § 106, we
  find: 'Soch <!-- Page 431 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page431"></a>[431]</span>a niggard or <i>hayn</i>, that he coulde
  not finde in his harte ... to departe with an halfpeny.' In the same, §
  22, we find: '<i>haines</i> and niggardes of their purse'; and, for a
  third example, see note to Parl. Foules, 610 (vol. i. p. 523). The word
  seems to be Scandinavian; cf. Icel. <i>hegna</i>, Dan. <i>hegne</i>, to
  hedge in, Swed. <i>hägna</i>, to fence, guard, protect; whence Lowl. Sc.
  <i>hain</i>, to hedge in, to preserve, to spare, to save money, to be
  penurious (Jamieson).</p>

  <p>1320. 'This priest being meanwhile unaware of his false practice.' See
  l. 1324.</p>

  <p>1342. Alluding to the proverb&mdash;'As fain as a fowl [i.&nbsp;e. bird] of
  a fair morrow'; given by Hazlitt in the form&mdash;'As glad as fowl of a
  fair day.' See Piers the Plowman, B. x. 153; Kn. Tale, 1579 (A.
  2437).</p>

  <p>1348. <i>To stonde in grace</i>; cf. Prol. 88; also A. 1173.</p>

  <p>1354. <i>By our</i>; pronounced <i>By'r</i>, as spelt in Shakespeare,
  Mid. Nt. Dr. iii. 1. 14.</p>

  <p>1362. <i>nere</i>, for <i>ne were</i>; meaning 'were it not for.'</p>

  <p>1381. <i>sy</i>, saw. The scribes also use the form <i>sey</i> or
  <i>seigh</i>, as in Kn. Tale, 208 (A. 1066); Franklin's Tale, F. 850, in
  both of which places it rimes with <i>heigh</i> (high). Of these
  spellings <i>sey</i> (riming with <i>hey</i>) is to be preferred in most
  cases. See note to Group B, l. 1.</p>

  <p>1388. This line begins with a large capital C in the Ellesmere MS.,
  shewing that the Tale itself is at an end, and the rest is the Yeoman's
  application of it.</p>

  <p>1389. 'There is strife between men and gold to that degree, that there
  is scarcely any (gold) left.'</p>

  <p>1408. Alluding to the proverb&mdash;'Burnt bairns fear fire.' This
  occurs among the Proverbs of Hendyng, in the form&mdash;'Brend child fur
  dredeth.' So in the Romaunt of the Rose, l. 1820&mdash;'Brent child of
  fyr hath muche drede.' The German is&mdash;'Ein gebranntes Kind fürchtet
  das Feuer'; see Ida v. Düringsfeld's Sprichwörter, i. 531.</p>

  <p>1410. Alluding to the proverb&mdash;'Better late than never'; in
  French 'Il vaut mieux tard que jamais.' The German is&mdash;'Besser spät
  als nie'; see Ida v. Düringsfeld's Sprichwörter, i. 204.</p>

  <p>1411. In Hazlitt's Proverbs&mdash;'Never is a long term.'</p>

  <p>1413. <i>Bayard</i> was a colloquial name for a horse; see Piers
  Plowman, B. iv. 53, 124; vi. 196; and 'As bold as blind Bayard' was a
  common proverb. See also Troil. i. 218; Gower, Conf. Amant. iii. 44;
  Skelton, ed. Dyce, ii. 139, 186. 'Bot al blustyrne forth unblest as
  Bayard the blynd'; Awdelay's Poems, p. 48.</p>

  <p>1416. 'As to turn aside from an obstacle in the road.'</p>

  <p>1419. Compare this with the Man of Lawes Tale, B. 552.</p>

  <p>1422. <i>rape and renne</i>, seize and clutch. The phrase, as it
  stands, is meaningless; <i>rapen</i> is to hurry, and <i>rennen</i> is to
  run, both verbs being intransitive. But it took the place of the older
  phrase <i>repen and rinen</i> (Ancren Riwle, p. 128), from A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>hrepian and hr&#x12B;nan</i>, to handle and touch. The Ancren Riwle
  gives the form <i>arepen and arechen</i>, with the various readings
  <i>repen and rinen</i>, <i>ropen and rimen</i>. Ihre quotes the <!-- Page
  432 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page432"></a>[432]</span>English
  '<i>rap and ran</i>, per fas et nefas ad se pertrahere.' Mr. Wedgwood
  notices <i>rap and ran</i>, to get by hook or crook, to seize whatever
  one can lay hands on, but misses the etymology. Palsgrave has&mdash;'<i>I
  rap or rende</i>, je rapine.' Coles (Eng. Dict. ed. 1684) has '<i>rap
  an[d] ren</i>, snatch and catch.' 'All they could rap and rend and
  pilfer'; Butler, Hudibras, pt. ii. c. 2. 789. (First ed., <i>rap and
  run</i>.) The phrase is still in use in the (corrupted) form to <i>rape
  and rend</i>, or (in Cleveland) <i>to rap and ree</i>.</p>

  <p>Briefly, <i>rape</i>, properly to hurry (Icel. <i>hrapa</i>), is a
  false substitute for A. S. <i>hrepian</i>, allied to G. <i>raffen</i>;
  whilst <i>renne</i>, to run, is a false substitute for A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>hr&#x12B;nan</i>, to touch, lay hold of.</p>

  <p>1428. Arnoldus de Villa Nova was a French physician, theologian,
  astrologer, and alchemist; born about <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 1235,
  died <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 1314. Tyrwhitt refers us to Fabricius,
  Bibl. Med. Æt., in v. Arnaldus Villanovanus. In a tract printed in
  Theatrum Chemicum, iii. 285, we have a reference to the same
  saying&mdash;'Et hoc est illud quod magni philosophi scripserunt, quod
  lapis noster fit ex Mercurio et sulphure praeparatis et separatis, et de
  hoc opere et substantia dicit Magister Arnoldus in tractatu suo
  parabolice, nisi granum frumenti in terra cadens mortuum fuerit, &amp;c.
  Intelligens pro grano mortuo in terra, Mercurium mortuum cum sale petrae
  et vitriolo Romano, et cum sulphure; et ibi mortificatur, et ibi
  sublimatur cum igne, et sic multum fructus adfert, et hic est lapis major
  omnibus, quem philosophi quaesiverunt, et inventum absconderunt.' The
  whole process is described, but it is quite unintelligible to me. It is
  clear that two circumstances stand very much in the way of our being able
  to follow out such processes; these are (1) that the same substance was
  frequently denoted by six or seven different names; and (2) that one name
  (such as sulphur) denoted five or six different things (such as sulphuric
  acid, orpiment, sulphuret of arsenic, &amp;c.).</p>

  <p>1429. <i>Rosarie</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Rosarium Philosophorum, the name of a
  treatise on alchemy by Arnoldus de Villa Nova; Theat. Chem. iv. 514.</p>

  <p>1431. The word <i>mortification</i> seems to have been loosely used to
  denote any change due to chemical action. Phillips explained
  <i>Mortify</i> by&mdash;'Among chymists, to change the outward form or
  shape of a mixt body; as when quicksilver, or any other metal, is
  dissolved in an acid menstruum.'</p>

  <p>1432. 'Unless it be with the knowledge (i.&nbsp;e. aid) of his brother.'
  The 'brother' of Mercury was sulphur or brimstone (see l. 1439). The
  dictum itself is, I suppose, as worthless as it is obscure.</p>

  <p>1434. <i>Hermes</i>, i.&nbsp;e. Hermes Trismegistus, fabled to have been
  the inventor of alchemy. Several books written by the New Platonists in
  the fourth century were ascribed to him. Tyrwhitt notes that a treatise
  <i>under his name</i> may be found in the Theatrum Chemicum, vol. iv. See
  Fabricius, Bibliotheca Graeca, lib. i. c. 10; and Smith's Classical
  Dictionary. The name is preserved in the phrase 'to seal
  <i>hermetically</i>.' <!-- Page 433 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Mr. Furnivall printed, for the Early Eng. Text Society, a tract called
  The Book of Quinte Essence, 'a tretice in Englisch breuely drawe out of

  <p>1438. <i>dragoun</i>, dragon. Here, of course, it means mercury, or
  some compound containing it. In certain processes, the solid residuum was
  also called <i>draco</i> or <i>draco qui comedit caudam suam</i>. This
  <i>draco</i> and the <i>cauda draconis</i> are frequently mentioned in
  the old treatises; see Theatrum Chemicum, iii. 29, 36, &amp;c. The terms
  may have been derived from astrology, since 'dragon's head' and 'dragon's
  tail' were common terms in that science. Chaucer mentions the latter in
  his Astrolabe, ii. 4. 23. And see 'Draco' in Theat. Chem. ii. 456.</p>

  <p>1440. <i>sol</i> and <i>luna</i>, gold and silver. The alchemists
  called <i>sol</i> (gold) the father, and <i>luna</i> (silver) the mother
  of the elixir or philosopher's stone. See Theat. Chem. iii. 9, 24, 25;
  iv. 528. Similarly, sulphur was said to be the father of minerals, and
  mercury the mother. Id. iii. 7.</p>

  <p>1447. <i>secree</i>, secret of secrets. Tyrwhitt notes&mdash;'Chaucer
  refers to a treatise entitled Secreta Secretorum, which was supposed to
  contain the sum of Aristotle's instructions to Alexander. See Fabricius,
  Bibliotheca Graeca, vol. ii. p. 167. It was very popular in the middle
  ages. Ægidius de Columnâ, a famous divine and bishop, about the latter
  end of the 13th century, built upon it his book De Regimine Principum, of
  which our Occleve made a free translation in English verse, and addressed
  it to Henry V. while Prince of Wales. A part of Lydgate's translation of
  the Secreta Secretorum is printed in Ashmole's Theatrum Chemicum
  Britannicum, p. 397. He did not translate more than about half of it,
  being prevented by death. See MS. Harl. 2251, and Tanner, Bibl. Brit.
  s.&nbsp;v. Lydgate. The greatest part of the viith Book of Gower's Confessio
  Amantis [see note to l. 820] is taken from this supposed work of
  Aristotle.' In the Theatrum Chemicum, iii. 14, I find an allusion to the
  philosopher's stone ending with these words&mdash;'Et Aristoteles ad
  Alexandrum Regem dicit in libro de secretis secretorum, capitulo
  penultimo: O Alexander, accipe lapidem mineralem, vegetabilem, et
  animalem, et separa elementa.' See Warton, Hist. Eng. Poetry, sect. 19;
  iii. 19 (ed. 1871), or ii. 230 (ed. 1840).</p>

  <p>1450. Tyrwhitt says&mdash;'The book alluded to is printed in the
  Theatrum Chemicum, vol. v. p. 219 [p. 191, ed. 1660], under this title,
  Senioris Zadith fil. Hamuelis Tabula Chemica. The story which follows of
  Plato and his disciples is there told, p. 249 [p. 224, ed. 1660], with
  some variations, of Solomon. "Dixit Salomon rex, Recipe lapidem qui
  dicitur Thitarios (<i>sic</i>).... Dixit sapiens, Assigna mihi illum....
  Dixit, Est corpus magnesiae.... Dixit, Quid est magnesia?... Respondit,
  Magnesia est aqua, composita," &amp;c.' The name of Plato <!-- Page 434
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page434"></a>[434]</span>occurs thrice
  <i>only a few lines below</i>, which explains Chaucer's mistake. We find
  'Titan Magnesia' in Ashmole's Theat. Chem. p. 275; cf. pp. 42, 447. The
  Gk. <span title="titanos" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F77;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> means lime,
  gypsum, white earth, chalk, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>1457. <i>ignotum per ignotius</i>, lit. an unknown thing through a
  thing more unknown; i.&nbsp;e. an explanation of a hard matter by means of a
  term that is harder still.</p>

  <p>1460. The theory that all things were made of the four elements,
  earth, air, fire, and water, was the foundation on which all alchemy was
  built; and it was the obstinacy with which this idea was held that
  rendered progress in science almost impossible. The words were used in
  the widest sense; thus air meant any vapour or gas; water, any liquid;
  earth, any solid sediment; and fire, any amount of heat. Hence also the
  theory of the four complexions of men; for even man was likewise composed
  of the four elements, under the influence of the planets and stars. See
  Gower, Conf. Amant. bk. vii; Theat. Chem. iii. 82; iv. 533, 537; and the
  note to A. 420, at p. 40 above.</p>

  <p>1461. <i>rote</i> represents the Lat. <i>radix</i>. In the Theat.
  Chem., ii. 463, we read that the philosopher's stone 'est <i>radix</i>,
  de quo omnes sapientes tractauerunt.'</p>

  <p>1469. 'Except where it pleases His Deity to inspire mankind, and
  again, to forbid whomsoever it pleases Him.'</p>

  <p>1479. <i>terme of his lyve</i>, during the whole term of his life.</p>

  <p>1481. <i>bote of his bale</i>, a remedy for his evil, help out of his
  trouble.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">NOTES TO GROUP H.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Manciple's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>1. <i>Wite ye</i>, know ye. The singular is <i>I woot</i>, A. S. <i>ic
  w&#x101;t</i>, M&oelig;so-Goth. <i>ik wait</i>; the plural is <i>we
  witen</i> or <i>we wite</i>, A.&nbsp;S. <i>we witon</i>, M&oelig;so-Goth.
  <i>weis witum</i>. See l. 82, where the right form occurs. But it is
  certain that Chaucer also uses the construction <i>ye woot</i>, as in A.
  829, &amp;c.; which, strictly speaking, was ungrammatical.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Bob-up-and-doun.</i> This place is here described as being
  'under the Blee,' i.&nbsp;e. under Blean Forest. It is also between
  Boughton-under-Blean (see Group G, l. 556) and Canterbury. This situation
  suits very well with Harbledown, and it has generally been supposed that
  Harbledown is here intended. Harbledown is spelt <i>Herbaldoun</i> in the
  account of Queen Isabella's journey to Canterbury (see Furnivall's
  Temporary Preface, p. 31; p. 124, l. 18; p. 127, l. 21), and
  <i>Helbadonne</i> in the account of King John's journey (id. p. 131, l.
  1). However, Mr. J. M. Cowper, in a letter to The Athenæum, Dec. 26,
  1868, p. 886, says that there still exists a place called Up-and-down
  Field, in the parish of Thannington, which would suit the position
  equally well, and he believes it to be the place really meant. If so, the
  old road must have taken a somewhat different direction from the present
  one, and there are reasons for supposing that such may have been the
  case. This letter is reprinted in Furnivall's Temporary Preface (Ch.
  Soc.), p. 32.</p>

  <p>The break here between the Canon's Yeoman's and the Manciple's Tales
  answers to the break between the first and second parts of Lydgate's
  Storie of Thebes. At the end of Part I, Lydgate mentions the descent down
  the hill (i.&nbsp;e. Boughton hill), and at the beginning of Part II, he says
  that the pilgrims, on their <i>return</i> from Canterbury, had 'passed
  the thorp of Boughton-on-the-blee.'</p>

  <p>5. <i>Dun is in the myre</i>, a proverbial saying originally used in
  an old rural sport. <i>Dun</i> means a dun horse, or, like <i>Bayard</i>,
  a horse in general. The game is described in Brand's Popular Antiquities,
  4to. ii. 289; and in Gifford's notes to Ben Jonson, vol. vii. p. 283. The
  latter explanation is quoted by Nares, whom see. Briefly, the game was of
  this kind. A large log of wood is brought into the midst of a kitchen or
  large room. The cry is raised that 'Dun is in the mire,' <!-- Page 436
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page436"></a>[436]</span>i.&nbsp;e. that the
  cart-horse is stuck in the mud. Two of the company attempt to drag it
  along; if they fail, another comes to help, and so on, till Dun is
  extricated.</p>

  <p>There are frequent allusions to it; see Hoccleve, De Regimine
  Principum, p. 86; Skelton, Garland of Laurell, l. 1433; Towneley
  Mysteries, p. 310; Romeo and Juliet, i. 4. 41; Beaumont and Fletcher's
  Woman-hater, iv. 3; Hudibras, pt. iii. c. iii. l. 110.</p>

  <p>In the present passage it means&mdash;'we are all at a standstill'; or
  'let us make an effort to move on.' Mr. Hazlitt, in his Proverbial
  Phrases, quotes a line&mdash;'And all gooth bacward, and <i>don is in the
  myr</i>.'</p>

  <p>12. <i>Do him come forth</i>, make him come forward. Cf. Group B,
  1888, 1889.</p>

  <p>14. <i>a botel hay</i>, a bottle of hay; similarly, we have <i>a barel
  ale</i>, Monk's Prol. B. 3083. And see l. 24 below. A bottle of hay was a
  small bundle of hay, less than a truss, as explained in my note to The
  Two Noble Kinsmen, v. 2. 45. 'Nec vendant [foenum] per botellum'; Liber
  Albus, p. 721.</p>

  <p>16. <i>by the morwe</i>, in the morning. There is no need to explain
  away the phrase, or to say that it means in the afternoon, as Tyrwhitt
  does. The Canon's Yeoman's tale is the first told on the third day, and
  the Manciple's is only the second. The Cook seems to have taken too much
  to drink over night, and to have had something more before starting. The
  fresh air has kept him awake for a while at first, but he is now very
  drowsy indeed.</p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt well remarks that there is no allusion here to the unfinished
  Cook's Tale in Group A. This seems to shew that the Manciple's Prologue
  was written before the Cook's Tale was begun. Note that the Cook is here
  excused; l. 29.</p>

  <p>23. 'I know not why, but I would rather go to sleep than have the best
  gallon of wine in Cheapside.' <i>me were lever slepe</i>, lit. it would
  be dearer to me to sleep.</p>

  <p>24. <i>Than</i> constitutes the first foot; <i>beste</i> is
  dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>29. <i>as now</i>, for the present; a common phrase.</p>

  <p>33. <i>not wel disposed</i>, indisposed in health.</p>

  <p>42. <i>fan</i>, the fan or vane or board of the quintain. The
  quintain, as is well known, consisted of a cross-bar turning on a pivot
  at the top of a post. At one end of the cross-bar was the fan or board,
  sometimes painted to look like a shield, and at the other was a club or
  bag of sand. The jouster at the fan had to strike the shield, and at the
  same time to avoid the stroke given by the swinging bag. The Cook was
  hardly in a condition for this; his eye and hand were alike unsteady, and
  his figure did not suggest that he possessed the requisite agility. See
  <i>Quintain</i> in Nares, and Strutt's Sports and Pastimes, bk. iii. c.
  1; As You Like It, i. 2. 263, on which see Mr. Wright's note (Clar. Press
  Series); Stow, Survey of London, ed. Thoms, pp. 36, 215.</p>

  <p>44. <i>wyn ape</i>, ape-wine, or ape's wine. Tyrwhitt rightly
  considers this the same as the <i>vin de singe</i> in the Calendrier des
  Bergers, sign. <!-- Page 437 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page437"></a>[437]</span>l. ii. b., where the author speaks of the
  different effects produced by wine upon different men, according to their
  temperaments. 'The Cholerick, he says, <i>a vin de lyon; cest a dire,
  quant a bien beu, veult tanser, noyser, et battre</i>. The Sanguine <i>a
  vin de singe; quant a plus beu, tant est plus joyeux</i>. In the same
  manner, the Phlegmatic is said to have <i>vin de mouton</i>, and the
  Melancholick <i>vin de porceau</i>.'</p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt adds&mdash;'I find the same four animals applied to
  illustrate the effects of wine in a little Rabbinical tradition, which I
  shall transcribe here from Fabricius, Cod. Pseudepig. Veteris Testamenti,
  vol. i. p. 275. "Vineas plantanti Noacho Satanam se junxisse memorant,
  qui, dum Noa vites plantaret, mactaverit apud illas <i>ovem</i>,
  <i>leonem</i>, <i>simiam</i>, et <i>suem</i>: Quod principio potûs vini
  homo sit instar <i>ovis</i>, vinum sumptum efficiat ex homine
  <i>leonem</i>, largius haustum mutet eum in saltantem <i>simiam</i>, ad
  ebrietatem infusum transformet illum in pollutam et prostratam
  <i>suem</i>." See also Gesta Romanorum, c. 159, where a story of the same
  purport is quoted from Josephus, <i>in libro de casu rerum
  naturalium</i>.' Wine of ape occurs in a detailed proverb, in Le Roux de
  Lincy, Prov. Franç. 1842, p. 157. The most ancient source is the
  Talmudical Parable, given in <i>Rabbinische Blumenlese</i>, Leipzig,
  1844, p. 192, by Leopold Dukes (N. and Q. S. i. xii. 123).</p>

  <p>In Bernardus de Cura Rei Familiaris, ed. Lumby, p. 13, a drunken man
  is thus described:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And qhuilis <i>a nape</i>, to mak mowis as a fule,</p>
      <p>Bot as <i>a sow</i>, quhen he fallis in a pule.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And Lydgate, in his Troy-book, L. 1, back, col. 2, says of
  one:&mdash;'And with a strawe playeth lyke an ape.'</p>

  <p>Warton (Hist. E. P. ed. 1871, i. 283) gives a slight sketch of chapter
  159 in the Gesta, referring to Tyrwhitt's note, and explaining it in the
  words&mdash;'when a man begins to drink, he is meek and ignorant as the
  lamb, then becomes bold as the lion, his courage is soon transformed into
  the foolishness of the ape, and at last he wallows in the mire like a
  sow.'</p>

  <p>In Colyn Blowboll's Testament, l. 280 (pr. in Hazlitt's Early Pop.
  Poetry, i. 104-5) we find:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Such as wilbe drongen (<i>sic</i>) <i>as an ape</i> ...</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Barclay, in his Ship of Fools, ed. Jamieson, i. 96, speaking of
  drunken men, says&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Some <i>sowe-dronke</i>, swaloyng mete without mesure.'</p>

      <p class="hg1">'Some are <i>Ape-dronke</i>, full of lawghter and of toyes.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The following interesting explanation by Lacroix is much to the same
  effect:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'In Germany and in France it was the custom at the public entries <!--
  Page 438 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page438"></a>[438]</span>of
  kings, princes, and persons of rank, to offer them the wines made in the
  district, and commonly sold in the town. At Langres, for instance, these
  wines were put into four pewter vessels called <i>cimaises</i>, which are
  still to be seen. They were called the <i>lion</i>, <i>monkey</i>,
  <i>sheep</i>, and <i>pig</i> wines&mdash;symbolic names, which expressed
  the different degrees or phases of drunkenness which they were supposed
  to be capable of producing: the lion, courage; the monkey, cunning; the
  sheep, good temper; the pig, bestiality.'&mdash;P. Lacroix; Manners,
  Customs, and Dress during the Middle Ages, 1874, p. 508.</p>

  <p>Massinger has: 'Nay, if you are <i>lion-drunk</i>, I will make one';
  The Bondman, A. iii. sc. 3.</p>

  <p>A note in Bell's edition quotes an illustrative passage from a song in
  Lyly's play of Mother Bombie, printed in the Songs from the Dramatists,
  ed. Bell, p. 56:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'O the dear blood of grapes</p>
      <p>Turns us to antic shapes,</p>
      <p>Now to show tricks <i>like apes</i>,</p>
      <p>Now <i>lion-like</i> to soar'; &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The idea here intended is precisely that expressed by Barclay. The
  Cook, being very dull and ill-humoured, is ironically termed ape-drunk,
  as if he were 'full of lawghter and of toyes,' and ready to play even
  with a straw. The satire was too much for the Cook, who became excited,
  and fell from his horse in his attempts to oppose the Manciple.</p>

  <p>50. <i>chiváchee</i>, feat of horsemanship, exploit. See Prol. 85 for
  the serious use of the word, where <i>in chivachye</i> means on an
  (equestrian) expedition. Cf.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Bot oute sal ride a chivauchè';</p>
      <p style="margin-left:5.0em">Ritson's Ancient Songs, vol. i. p. 46.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>51. 'Alas! he did not stick to his ladle!' He should have been in a
  kitchen, basting meat, not out of doors, on the back of a horse.</p>

  <p>57. <i>dominacioun</i>, dominion. See note to F. 352. Cf. 'the
  righteous shall have <i>domination</i> over them in the morning'; Ps.
  xlix. 14, Prayer-book Version. See Chaucer's Minor Poems, xv. 16 (vol. i.
  p. 394).</p>

  <p>62. <i>fneseth</i>, blows, puffs; of which the reading <i>sneseth</i>
  is a poor corruption, though occurring in all the modern editions. To
  <i>fnese</i> does not mean to sneeze, but to breathe hard; though
  <i>sneeze</i> is its modern form.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt that the word <i>neesings</i> in Job xli. 18, meaning
  not 'sneezings' but 'hard breathings,' is due to the word
  <i>fnesynge</i>, by which Wyclif translates the Latin <i>sternutatio</i>.
  In Jer. viii. 16, Wyclif represents the snorting of horses by
  <i>fnesting</i>. Cf. A.&nbsp;S. <i>fnæst</i>, a puff, blast, <i>fnæstiað</i>,
  the windpipe; <i>fn&#x113;osung</i>, a hard breathing. Grimm's law helps
  us to a further illustration; for, as the English <i>f</i> is a Greek
  <i>p</i>, a cognate word is at once seen in the common Greek verb <span
  title="pneô" class="grk">&pi;&nu;&#x1F73;&omega;</span>, I breathe or
  blow. For further examples, see <i>fnast</i> in Stratmann.</p>

  <p><i>pose</i>, a cold in the head. Fully described in Batman upon
  Bartholomè, lib. vii. c. 4&mdash;'Of the Pose.' See A. 4152. <!-- Page
  439 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page439"></a>[439]</span></p>

  <p>72. To <i>reclaim</i> a hawk is to bring it back to the hawker's hand;
  this was generally effected by holding out a <i>lure</i>, or something
  tempting to eat. For young hawks, the <i>lure</i> was an artificial bird
  made of feathers and leather; see note in Dyce's Skelton, ii. 147. Here
  the Host means that some day the Cook will hold out a bait to, or lay a
  snare for, the Manciple, and get him into his power; for example, he
  might examine the details of the Manciple's accounts with an inconvenient
  precision, and perhaps the amounts charged, if tested, would not appear
  to be strictly honest. The Manciple replies in all good humour, that such
  a proceeding might certainly bring him into trouble. See Prol. 570-586.
  Cf. Strutt, Sports, bk. i. c. 2. § 9.</p>

  <p>76. Read <i>mauncipl'</i>, and pronounce <i>were a</i> rapidly.</p>

  <p>83. 'Yea, of an excellent vintage.'</p>

  <p>90. <i>pouped</i>, blown; see Nonne Prestes Tale, 578. Here 'blown
  upon this horn' is a jocular phrase for 'taken a drink out of this
  gourd.'</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Maunciples Tale.</b></p>

  <p>This story, of Eastern origin, is told in Ovid's Metamorphoses, bk.
  ii. ll. 534-550, whence Chaucer evidently took it. Gower, also following
  Ovid, gives the story very briefly; see his Conf. Amantis, ed. Pauli, i.
  305. Compare the tale of the three cocks, Gesta Romanorum, cap. 68; also
  the Seven Sages, ed. Weber, l. 2201 (Metrical Rom. vol. iii. p. 86).
  Somewhat similar in idea is a tale in the Knight de la Tour, c. 16. See
  further in vol. iii. p. 501.</p>

  <p>109. <i>Phitoun</i>, the Python, shot by Apollo; see Ovid, Met. i.
  438-444; Dryden, trans. of Ovid's Met., i. 587.</p>

  <p>116. <i>Amphioun</i>, Amphion; see note to E. 1716. Cf. Horace, De

  <p>148. As indicated by a side-note in Hn., this passage is taken
  directly from the Liber Aureolus de Nuptiis of Theophrastus, as cited by
  St. Jerome near the end of the first Book of his treatise against
  Jovinian. Cf. note to D. 221.</p>

  <p>The passage from Theophrastus is:&mdash;'Verum quid prodest etiam
  diligens custodia: cum uxor seruari impudica non possit, pudica non
  debeat? Infida enim custos est castitatis necessitas: et illa uere pudica
  dicenda est, cui licuit peccare si uoluit. Pulchra cito adamatur, foeda
  facile concupiscit. Difficile custoditur, quod plures
  amant.'&mdash;Hieron. Opus Epistolarum (Basil. 1534); ii. 51.</p>

  <p>161. Cf. Horace, Epist. I. x. 24&mdash;'Naturam expellas furca, tamen
  usque recurret,' &amp;c. And this is the very passage which Chaucer had
  <!-- Page 440 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page440"></a>[440]</span>in view, as it is quoted and commented on
  in Le Roman de la Rose, 14221-8, &amp;c. Jean de Meun adds the

  <p>This passage in Le Roman is <i>preceded</i> by the illustration of the
  caged bird, and <i>followed</i> by that of the cat; see ll. 163, 175.

  Boethius; see next note.</p>

  <p><i>vileins kinde</i>, nature of a villain, a villainous or base
  disposition. Practically, <i>vileins</i> has here the force of an
  adjective, and came to be so regarded, as shewn by the formation from it
  of the adv. <i>vileinsly</i>, which occurs in I. 154, and elsewhere.
  Similarly, the gen. case <i>wonders</i> became the adj. <i>wonders</i>,
  which was gradually turned into <i>wondrous</i>; see <i>Wondrous</i> in
  my Etym. Dictionary.</p>

  <p>This adj. <i>vileyns</i>, with the sense of 'villainous,' is unnoticed
  in <!-- Page 441 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page441"></a>[441]</span>Halliwell and Stratmann. Yet Chaucer uses
  it often, as the reader may see for himself. See D. 1158, 1268, I. 556,
  631, 652, 715, 802, 854, 914; and hence <i>vileinsly</i>, adv., I. 154,
  279, Rom. Rose, 1498.</p>

  <p>193. <i>newefangel</i>, eager of novelty; see note to F. 618.</p>

  <p>195. <i>souneth in-to</i>, accords with; see notes to A. 307, B. 3157,
  C. 54, and F. 517.</p>

  <p>204. <i>lemman</i>, short for <i>leef man</i>, lit. dear man. The
  context shews that it was considered a 'knavish' word at this period.</p>

  <p>207-8. Repeated from Prol. 741-2; see note to A. 741.</p>

  <p>215. The line, as it stands, is deficient in the first foot, and is
  not pleasing. Tyrwhitt reads <i>any</i> for <i>a</i>. This improves it;
  but I do not know where he found <i>any</i>. The old editions of 1550 and
  1561 have <i>a</i>, like the MSS.</p>

  <p>220. <i>wenche</i>, like <i>lemman</i>, was a 'knavish' word; see E.
  2202.</p>

  <p>223. <i>titlelees</i>, title-less, glossed in Hn. by the words <i>sine
  titulo</i>. It means 'usurping,' as applied to one who has no title or
  claim to a throne except force. Obviously written before 1399!</p>

  <p>224. Here <i>out-law-e</i> is trisyllabic, and the final <i>e</i> is
  preserved by the caesura. But in l. 231 the accent is thrown back, and it
  is dissyllabic, as in modern English. Tyrwhitt puts <i>any</i> for
  <i>a</i>, against all authority.</p>

  <p>227. This well-known story of Alexander occurs in the Gesta Romanorum,
  c. 146; and this circumstance gave it vogue. In Swan's translation, the
  tale begins thus:&mdash;'Augustine tells us in his book, De Civitate Dei,
  that Diomedes, in a piratical galley, for a long time infested the sea,
  plundering and sinking many ships. Being captured by command of
  Alexander, before whom he was brought, the king inquired how he dared to
  molest the seas. "How darest <i>thou</i>," replied he, "molest the earth?
  Because I am master only of a single galley, I am termed a robber; but
  you, who oppress the world with huge squadrons, are called a king and a
  conquerour."' John of Salisbury repeats the story in his Policraticus,
  lib. iii. c. 14. Cf. Higden, Polychron. iii. 422.</p>

  <p>239. <i>volage</i>, giddy, thoughtless; cf. E. <i>volatile</i>. See
  the E. version of the Romaunt of the Rose, l. 1284 (vol. i. p. 147).</p>

  <p>243. It was already understood that <i>cuckoo</i> was, as Shakespeare
  says, 'a word of fear'; see Love's Labour's Lost, v. 2. 920. In the Parl.
  of Foules, 358, we find: 'the cukkow ever unkinde'; vol. i. p. 348.</p>

  thou art deceived or cajoled. See A. 4049.</p>

  <p>262. <i>wryen</i>, to turn aside hastily; see A. 3283.</p>

  <p>271. <i>scorpioun</i>, scorpion. Alluding to the notion that the
  scorpion, though its sting was deadly, had a flattering tongue, and could
  beguile. See notes to B. 404, E. 2059.</p>

  <p>278. <i>rakel</i>, rash, hasty; afterwards altered to
  <i>rake-hell</i>, by a curious popular etymology; and then shortened to
  <i>rake</i>, as in the phrase 'a dissolute <i>rake</i>.' See <i>rake</i>
  (2) in my Etym. Dictionary. Cf. l. 283.</p>

  <p>279. <i>trouble</i>, adj., troubled, clouded, obscured. Tyrwhitt
  explains <!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  its occurrence in E. 465 above. And see Pers. Tale, I. 537.</p>

  <p>This shews that the scribe remembered the fifth line in the Manciple's

  <p>317. Sayings similar to those quoted below are common; but Dr. E.
  Köppel has shewn (in Archiv für das Studium der neueren Sprachen, ed. L.
  Herrig, vol. lxxxvi, p. 44) that Chaucer had particularly in mind a
  treatise by Albertano of Brescia, entitled De arte loquendi et tacendi.
  He refers us to a new edition by Thor Sundby, in a work entitled Brunetto
  Latinos levnet og skrifter, Kopenhagen, 1869.</p>

  <p>We may further compare a passage in Le Roman de la Rose, 7069, which
  professes to follow Ptolemy's Almagest. And we find similar pieces of
  advice in Middle English, with such titles as 'How the Good Wife taught
  her Daughter,' and 'How the Wise man taught his Son'; but these are
  probably later than the time of Chaucer.</p>

  <p>325. The corresponding passage in Albertano's treatise is the
  following, p. xcviii:&mdash;'Paucos vel neminem tacendo, multos loquendo
  circumventos vidimus, quod pulchre voluit, qui ait: Nil tacuisse nocet,
  nocet esse saepe locutum.' This hexameter is quoted from Dionysius Cato,
  Distich. lib. i. dist. 12, slightly altered. Cato has: 'Nam nulli
  tacuisse nocet, nocet esse locutum.' Cf. the common proverb&mdash;'a
  fool's bolt is soon shot,' which appears in the Proverbs of Alfred, l.
  421. As to Cato, see note to G. 688.</p>

  <p>329. The corresponding passage in Albertano is:&mdash;'Causa igitur
  finalis tui dicti sit aut pro Dei servitio aut pro humano commodo, aut
  pro utroque'; p. cx. <!-- Page 443 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page443"></a>[443]</span></p>

  <p>332. In Albertano's treatise, p. xcvi, we find:&mdash;'Catho dixit:
  Virtutem primam esse puta compescere linguam.' From Dion. Cato, Distich.
  lib. i. dist. 3. Chaucer quotes it again in Troilus, iii. 294. Cf. Le
  Rom. de la Rose, 7073-4.</p>

  <p>335. Cf. Albertano, p. cxv:&mdash;'In quantitate insuper modum
  requiras non multa dicendo; nam in multiloquio non deest peccatum.' This
  refers to Prov. x. 19:&mdash;'In multiloquio non deerit peccatum.'</p>

  <p>340. Cf. Ps. lvii. 4:&mdash;'and their tongue a sharp sword.'</p>

  <p>344. See Prov. vi. 17, where 'a lying tongue' is said to be one of the
  seven things which 'are an abomination unto' the Lord. See also Prov. x.
  31, xvii. 20, xxvi. 28, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>345. Cf. Ps. x. 7, xii. 3, lii. 2, lxiv. 3-8, cxx. 3, &amp;c. The
  reference to Seneca is, probably, to his treatise De Ira, from which two
  stories in the Sompnours Tale are taken; or it may be to the Sentences of
  Publilius Syrus, which are frequently quoted in the Tale of Melibeus
  under the name of 'Senek.'</p>

  <p>350. Evidently an allusion to some Flemish proverb, equivalent to our
  'least said, soonest mended,' which Hazlitt gives in the
  form&mdash;'Little said, soon amended.' In Bell's edition, the suggested
  form of the proverb is&mdash;'of little meddling comes great ease,' which
  comes nearer to the text. Chaucer has already given us a Flemish proverb
  in A. 4357.</p>

  <p>355. 'Et semel emissum fugit irreuocabile uerbum'; Horace, Epist. I.
  xviii. 71. Chaucer found this line of Horace in Albertano's treatise (p.
  xcviii); or in Le Roman, 16746-8.</p>

  <p>357. Cf. Albertano's treatise, p. cvi:&mdash;'Consilium vel secretum
  tuum absconditum quasi in carcere tuo est reclusum; revelatum vero te in
  carcere suo tenet ligatum.'</p>

  <p>359. This is clearly, as Tyrwhitt suggests, from Dionysius Cato,
  Distich. lib. i. dist. 12:&mdash;'Rumores fuge, ne incipias <i>novus
  auctor</i> haberi.'</p>

<p class="ac lg125">NOTES TO GROUP I.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Parson's Prologue.</b></p>

  <p>1. <i>maunciple</i>, manciple; see the last Tale. But there is no real
  connexion between this Group and Group H. It is most likely that the word
  <i>maunciple</i> was only inserted provisionally.</p>

  <p>When the Manciple had told his Tale, it was still only morning; see H.
  16, and the note. The Pilgrims, however, had not far to go. Perhaps we
  may suppose that they halted on the road, having a shorter day's work
  before them than on previous occasions, and then other Tales might have
  been introduced; so that the time wore away till the afternoon came. It
  is clear, from l. 16, that the Parson's Tale was <i>intended</i>, when
  the final reversion should be made, to be the last on the outward
  journey. Whatever difficulties exist in the arrangement of the Tales may
  fairly be considered as due to the fact, that the final revision was
  never made.</p>

  <p>4. <i>nyne and twenty.</i> In my Preface to Chaucer's Astrolabe (E. E.
  T. S.), p. lxiii, I have explained this passage fully. In that treatise,
  part ii. sections 41-43, Chaucer explains the method of taking altitudes.
  He here says that the sun was 29° high, and in ll. 6-9 he says that his
  height was to his shadow in the proportion of 6 to 11. This comes to the
  same thing, since the angle whose tangent is 6/11 is very nearly 29°.
  Chaucer would know this, as I have shewn, by simple inspection of an
  astrolabe, without calculation.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Foure</i>, four <span class="sm">P. M.</span> Many MSS. have
  <i>Ten</i>, but the necessity of the correction is undoubted. This was
  proved by Mr. Brae, in his edition of Chaucer's Astrolabe, pp. 71-74. We
  have merely to remember that <i>ten</i> <span class="sm">P. M.</span>
  would be <i>after sunset</i>, to see that some alteration must be made.
  Now the altitude of the sun was 29°, and the day of the year was about
  April 20; and these data require that the time of day should be about 4
  <span class="sm">P. M.</span> Tyrwhitt notes that some MSS. actually have
  the reading <i>Foure</i>, and this gives us authority for the change. Mr.
  Brae suggests that the reading <i>Ten</i> was very likely a gloss upon
  <i>Foure</i>; since <i>four</i> o'clock is the <i>tenth</i> hour of the
  day, reckoning from 6 <span class="sm">A. M.</span> The whole matter is
  thus accounted for. <!-- Page 445 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page445"></a>[445]</span></p>

  <p>10. <i>the mones exaltacioun</i>, the moon's exaltation. I have
  discussed this passage in my Preface to Chaucer's Astrolabe, (E. E. T.
  S.), p. lxiii. Of course Chaucer uses <i>exaltation</i> here (as in other
  passages) in its ordinary astrological sense. The 'exaltation' of a
  planet is that sign in which it was believed to exert its greatest
  influence; and, in accordance with this, the old tables call Taurus the
  'exaltation of the Moon,' and Libra the 'exaltation of Saturn.' These
  results, founded on no reasons, had to be remembered by sheer effort of
  memory, if remembered at all. I have no doubt, accordingly, that Chaucer
  (or his scribes) has made a mistake here, and that the reading should be
  'Saturnes,' as proposed by Tyrwhitt. The sentence then
  means&mdash;'Therewith Saturn's exaltation, I mean Libra, kept on
  continually ascending above the horizon.' This would be quite right, as
  the sign of Libra was actually ascending at the time supposed. The phrase
  'I mene Libra' may be paralleled by the phrase 'I mene Venus'; Kn. Tale,
  1358 (A. 2216); see also Group B. 1860, 2141. <i>alwey</i>, continually,
  is common in Chaucer; see Clerkes Tale, E. 458, 810. <i>gan ascende</i>,
  did ascend, is the opposite to <i>gan descende</i>; Clerkes Tale, E. 392.
  It is somewhat remarkable that the astrologers also divided each sign
  into three equal parts of ten degrees each, called 'faces'; mentioned in
  Chaucer's Astrolabe, ii. 4. 39, and in the Squieres Tale, F. 50.
  According to this arbitrary scheme, the first 10 degrees of Libra were
  called the 'face of the moon,' or 'mones face.' This suggests that
  Chaucer may, at the moment, have confused <i>face</i> with
  <i>exaltation</i>, thus giving us, as the portion of the zodiac intended,
  the first ten degrees of Libra.</p>

  <p>I doubt if the phrase is worth further discussion. For further
  information, see my Preface to Chaucer's Astrolabe (as above); and, for
  an ingenious (but impossible and unconvincing) theory, offered in
  explanation of the whole passage, see Mr. Brae's edition of the same, p.
  74. Most unfortunately, more than one attempt has been made to fix the
  date of the Canterbury Tales, by adopting as the true reading the phrase
  'In mene Libra,' and then pretending that the moon <i>itself</i> (not
  <i>its exaltation</i>) was 'in the middle of Libra.' But this reading is
  evolved out of a mistake in MS. Hl., which (after all) has not <i>In
  mene</i>, but <i>In mena</i> (!); neither does <i>In mene</i> mean 'in
  the middle.' All calculations founded on this rotten basis are
  necessarily worthless.</p>

  <p>16. This means that the Parson's Tale was meant to be the last one on
  the outward journey. Unfortunately, there lack a great many more tales
  than one, as the matter really stands.</p>

  <p>26. 'Unpack your wallet, and let us see what is in it.' In other
  words, tell us a story, and let us see what it is like.</p>

  <p>32. See 1 Tim. i. 4, iv. 7; 2 Tim. iv. 4.</p>

  <p>42. <i>Southren.</i> Nearly all alliterative poems are in the Northern
  or West-Midland dialect, as opposed to the East-Midland dialect of
  Chaucer, which approaches the Southern dialect. Still, it is the Parson
  <i>himself</i>, not Chaucer, who says he is a Southerner; though <!--
  Page 446 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page446"></a>[446]</span>perhaps the poet meant, naturally enough,
  to tell us that he was himself resident in Kent (probably at Greenwich).
  The dialect of Kent was Southern. Many Southern forms occur in Gower.</p>

  <p>43. <i>rum, ram, ruf</i> are of course nonsense words, chosen to
  represent alliteration, because they all alike begin with <i>r</i>. In
  most alliterative poetry, the number of words in a line beginning with a
  common letter is, as Chaucer suggests, <i>three</i>.</p>

  <p>The word <i>geste</i> here means no more than 'tell a story,' without
  reference to the form of the story. It is, however, worth noting that one
  very long alliterative poem on the siege of Troy, edited by Panton and
  Donaldson (Early English Text Society), bears the title of '<i>Gest</i>
  Hystoriale.' The number of distinctively Northern words in it is very
  considerable.</p>

  <p>I think that this line has been forced by some out of its true
  meaning, and made to convey a sneer against alliterative poetry which was
  by no means intended. Neither Chaucer himself nor his amiable parson
  would have spoken slightingly of other men's labours. The introduction of
  the words <i>rum, ram, ruf</i> conveys no more than a perfectly
  good-humoured allusion. That this is the true view is clear from the very
  next line, where the Parson declares that 'he holds rime but little
  better.'</p>

  <p>The most interesting question is&mdash;why should Chaucer allude to
  alliterative poetry <i>at all</i>? The answer is, in my view, that he
  distinctly wished to recognise the curious work of his contemporary
  William, whose Vision of Piers the Plowman had, by this time, passed, as
  it were, into a second edition, having been extremely popular in London,
  and especially amongst the lower classes. The author was <i>not</i> a
  Southerner, but his poem had come to London, together with himself,
  before <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 1377.</p>

  <p>In his play entitled The Old Wives' Tale, Peele introduces a character
  named Huanebango who imitates the spluttering hexameters used by
  Stanyhurst in his translation of a part of Vergil's Æneid, and afterwards
  says:&mdash;'I'll now set my countenance, and to her <i>in prose</i>; it
  may be, this <i>rim-ram-ruf</i> is too rude an encounter.' He evidently
  borrowed the expression from Chaucer.</p>

  <p>I may further observe that Chaucer did not <i>invent</i> these
  nonsense words himself; he probably borrowed them from some French
  source. For, in Sigart's Walloon Dictionary, we find these entries
  following.</p>

  <p>'<i>Rim ni ram (ça n'a ni)</i>, cela n'a ni rime ni raison.</p>

  <p><i>Rim-ram</i>, protocole, formulaire: <i>C'est toudi l'même
  rim-ram</i>, c'est toujours la même chanson.'</p>

  <p>51. Alluding to Rev. xxi. 2. There is also here a direct reference to
  the opening sentences of the Persones Tale; see I. 79, 80. <!-- Page 447
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page447"></a>[447]</span></p>

  <p>57. <i>textuel</i>, literally exact in giving the text. The next line
  means 'I only gather (and give you) the general meaning.' Most quotations
  at this period were very inexact, and Chaucer was no more exact than
  others.</p>

  <p>67. <i>hadde the wordes.</i> Tyrwhitt says&mdash;'This is a French
  phrase. It is applied to the Speaker of the Commons in Rot. Parl. 51 Edw.
  III. n. 87: "Mons. Thomas de Hungerford, Chivaler, qi <i>avoit les
  paroles</i> pur les Communes d'Angleterre en cest Parlement," &amp;c.' It
  means&mdash;was the spokesman.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>The Persones Tale.</b></p>

  <p>A considerable portion of this Tale (chiefly after § 23) is borrowed
  from a French Treatise by Frère Lorens, entitled 'La Somme des Vices et
  des Vertus,' the very treatise of which the Ayenbite of Inwyt is a
  translation. This treatise, says Dr. Morris, 'was composed in the year
  1279 for the use of Philip the Second of France, by Frère Lorens (or
  Laurentius Gallus, as he is designated in Latin), of the order of Friars
  Preachers' or Dominicans. There are two MS. copies of this treatise in
  the British Museum, viz. MS. Cotton, Cleopatra, A. v., and the Royal MS.
  19 C. ii.</p>

  <p>The printed text (circa 1495) is scarce; but numerous quotations from
  the Cotton MS. are given by Dr. W. Eilers, in Essays on Chaucer, Part V.,
  pp. 501-610, published by the Chaucer Society. I occasionally give
  extracts from these quotations below, and I simply denote them by the
  symbol 'Fr.' I also use 'Ayenb.' to denote the Ayenbite of Inwyt, ed.
  Morris (E. E. T. S.). An interesting review, by Dr. Koch, of this essay
  by Eilers, will be found in Anglia, vol. v. pt. ii. p. 130.</p>

  <p>The 'sections' (marked §) into which the Tale is divided are the same
  as in Tyrwhitt's edition, though he does not <i>number</i> them. Still,
  it renders reference to that edition an easy matter.</p>

  <p>The clauses or 'lines,' or short subdivisions, are the same as in the
  Six-text edition. Each 'line' ends with a slanting stroke, as in the Tale
  of Melibee, and they are numbered 'by fives' in the margin.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Text.</span> The 'text' at the head of the Tale is
  taken from the Vulgate version of Jer. vi. 16. The usual reading for
  <i>viis</i> is <i>semitis</i>.</p>

  <p>I have only partially succeeded in finding the numerous quotations.
  For some of the references I am indebted to the Rev. E. Marshall.</p>

  <p>75. A note in Bell's Chaucer suggests that we should read&mdash;'that
  <i>wole that</i> no man,' &amp;c.; inserting <i>wole that</i>. But the
  old edd. agree with the MSS.; and the text is right as it stands. <i>That
  no man wole perisse</i> = that wishes no one to perish. For this common
  use of <i>wole</i>, see the very next phrase, which means&mdash;'but
  desires that we may all come.' The reference is to 2 Pet. iii. 9, where
  Wyclif's later version has a similar turn of expression, viz. 'and wole
  not that ony men perische, but that alle turne ayen to penaunce.' <!--

  <p>77. A translation of Jer. vi. 16 above; it is nearest to Wyclif's
  earlier version: 'Stondeth up-on weies, and seeth, and asketh of the olde
  pathis, what is the goode weie; and goth in it, and yee shul fynde
  refreshinge to youre soules.'</p>

  <p>79. <i>espirituels</i>, the pl. (French) adj. in <i>s</i>, following
  its sb.; see B. 2038, F. 1278.</p>

  <p>80. Alluding to ll. 50, 51 of the Prologue to this Tale.</p>

  <p>82. <i>whennes it is cleped Penitence</i>; our author entirely forgets
  this clause in the sequel, and takes no more notice of the point here
  noted.</p>

  <p>84. 'Poenitentia est et mala praeterita plangere, et plangenda iterum
  non committere'; S. Ambrosii Opera, Appendix, Sermo xxv; ed. Migne
  (Cursus Patrologicus), vol. 17, col. 655.</p>

  <p>The quotations, chiefly from the Latin fathers, in this Persones Tale,
  are so numerous, and often so brief and inexact, that I am not able to
  give the references in more than a few instances. I have, however,
  succeeded in finding some of them, such as the one above.</p>

  <p>85. In the works of St. Ambrose, the following sentence occurs just
  above the one cited in the last note: 'Poenitentia vero est dolor cordis,
  et amaritudo animae pro malis quae quisque commisit.'</p>

  <p>89. St. Isidore of Seville is here intended (born <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 570, died <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 636). Cf.
  551 below, (p. 603). I find no passage which precisely answers to this
  quotation, but I think the following is intended: 'Nam qui plangit
  peccatum, et iterum admittit peccatum, quasi si quis lavet laterem
  crudum, quem quanto magis eluerit, tanto amplius lutum facit.'&mdash;S.
  Isidorus, Sententiarum lib. ii. c. 13; ed. Migne, vol. 83, col. 613. Here
  Isidore does not call the sinner a 'japer,' but says that he is as
  foolish as a man who washes an unburnt brick; for such a process only
  produces more mud.</p>

  <p>92. St. Gregory the Great, the first pope of that name, is here meant;
  and the following is probably the passage referred to: 'Ut intelligas in
  anima gravissimo iniquitatis pondere obrutum ... ut ad sublimia levari
  jam non valeat, quoniam iniquitatis eam [mentem] gravitudo
  coarctat.'&mdash;S. Gregorius, in Septem Psalmos Poenitentiales
  Expositio; Ps. xxvii. v. 8; ed. Migne, vol. 79, col. 572.</p>

  <p>93. <i>and forlete sinne</i>, and forsake sin before they die. This
  expression has already occurred at the end of the Phisiciens Tale; see C.
  286.</p>

  <p>94. Note the glosses in the footnotes; thus <i>tak</i> means
  <i>tene</i>, i.&nbsp;e. 'keep to'; and <i>siker</i> is <i>certum</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
  'sure.'</p>

  <p>96. It is quite hopeless to make any sense of this passage. It is
  perfectly clear that, as Koch suggests (see Anglia, V. pt. ii. p. 135), a
  considerable portion of the text is here <i>lost</i>. And no doubt it
  happened in the usual way, viz. by the omission of a clause included
  between some repeated words, such as <i>that a man</i>. Our author must
  have described, first of all, <i>three actions</i> of Penitence; and
  afterwards, <i>three defautes</i> (or defects) in doing penance. All that
  we have left is a notice of <i>the first action</i> (left unexplained),
  and a partial <!-- Page 449 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page449"></a>[449]</span>explanation of the three 'defautes.' I
  suggest, therefore, a <i>lacuna</i> after <i>that a man</i>; and I take
  it that the original text had: 'The firste accion of Penitence is <i>that
  a man</i> [do so and so. The second action is, that he do so and so. The
  third is, that he do so and so. Moreover, ye shall understand that there
  are three defautes in doing penance. The first is, if <i>that a man</i>]
  be baptized after that he hath sinned.' Some MSS. read <i>that if a
  man</i> or <i>if a man</i> before <i>be baptized</i>. I do not see that
  this helps us, because I do not think that this is where the fault really
  lies.</p>

  <p>97. The quotation here meant is the following: 'Omnis enim, qui iam
  arbiter voluntatis suae constitutus est, cum accedit ad sacramentum
  fidelium, nisi eum poeniteat vitae veteris, novam non potest inchoare':
  Homil. l.; in Opp. Basil. 1569, tom. x. col. 552 C.</p>

  <p>100. 'Est enim poenitentia bonorum et humilium fidelium poena
  quotidiana'; S. Aug. Opp. Basil. 1569, tom. ii. col. 507 A; Epist.
  cviii.</p>

  <p>102. <i>spyces</i>, species, kinds; of frequent occurrence in this
  Tale.</p>

  <p>103. The 'slaughter of children' here referred to is probably the
  accidental overlying of them by nurses, which was accounted a deadly sin,
  as being the result of negligence. This Chaucer expressly states below;
  see 575 (p. 604).</p>

  <p>105. <i>naked</i>, i.&nbsp;e. thinly clad, in little more than a shirt-like
  garment.</p>

  <p>108. Cf. P. Plowman, C. xvii. 29:&mdash;</p>

  <p>I find 'confessio' and 'cordis contritio' mentioned near together in
  the Latin version of St. Chrysostom's 20th homily on Genesis, cap. iv;
  ed. Migne, vol. liii. col. 170.</p>

  <p>115. Not the words of Christ, but of St. John the Baptist; Matt. iii.
  8.</p>

  <p>119. 'Et in timore Domini declinatur a malo'; Prov. xvi. 6.</p>

  <p>125. 'Iniquos odio habui, et legem tuam dilexi'; Ps. cxviii. (cxix.)
  113.</p>

  <p>126. Cf. Daniel iv. 10-27.</p>

  <p>127. The reference is probably to Prov. xxviii. 13.</p>

  <p>128. <i>In this Penitence</i>, i.&nbsp;e. in this 'spice' or particular
  portion of Penitence; for he is here speaking of Contrition only.</p>

  <p>130. St. Bernard of Clairvaux. The reference may be to the following
  passage: 'Tertius gradus est dolor, sed et ipse <i>trina connexione</i>
  ligatus. Vere post cognitionem et poenitentiam <i>dolor renovatus
  est</i>, et in meditatione mea ignis incanduit, quia <i>Creatorem
  offendi, Dominum non timui, sprevi benefactorem</i>.'&mdash;S. Bernardus,
  Sermo xl. § 5; ed. Migne, vol. 183, col. 649.</p>

  <p>134. I find nothing like this in Job; the nearest passage seems to be
  <!-- Page 450 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page450"></a>[450]</span>in ch. xxxiii. vv. 26-28, where the idea
  of forgiveness after confession is referred to.</p>

  <p>135. <i>Ezechie</i>, king Hezekiah; see Isaiah, xxxviii. 15
  (Vulgate).</p>

  <p>136. From Rev. ii. 5.</p>

  <p>138. Referring to 2 Pet. ii. 22.</p>

  <p>141. From Ezek. xx. 43.</p>

  <p>142. Really from John viii. 34; but cf. 2 Pet. ii. 19.</p>

  <p>143. Here, again, the reference is wrong. The text intended is,
  probably, Job xlii. 6, where the Vulgate has:&mdash;'Idcirco ipse me
  reprehendo, et ago poenitentiam in favilla et cinere.' Cf. Ps. xxxviii.
  6.</p>

  <p>144. The allusions to Seneca are numerous, and sentences from other
  authors are frequently attributed to him.</p>

  <p>150. 'Vis ut tibi seruiat cum quo factus es, et non uis seruire ei a
  quo factus es? Ergo cum uis ut seruiat tibi seruus tuus homo, et tu non
  uis seruire Deo, facis Deo quod tu pati non uis.'&mdash;S. Aug. Opp.
  Basil. 1569, tom. ix. col. 929 D; De Decem Chordis, cap. x.</p>

  <p>151. <i>Take reward of</i>, have regard to.</p>

  <p>154. <i>vileynsly</i>; an adv. formed from the adj. <i>vileyns</i>,
  base. See 652 below; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>156. See Prov. xi. 22. <i>groyn</i>, snout. 'Groyne of a swyne,
  <i>Rostrum porcinum</i>'; Prompt. Parv. Cotgrave has:&mdash;'<i>Groin de
  porceau</i>, the snowt of a Hog.' Florio's Ital. Dict.
  has:&mdash;'<i>Grugno</i>, the snout of a hog.' The Low Lat. form is
  <i>grunnus</i>; we find&mdash;'<i>Grunnus, Anglice</i> a gruyn, or a
  wrot'; Wright-Wülcker's Gloss. col. 587, l. 23. The A. S. word is
  <i>wr&#x14D;t</i>; whence M.&nbsp;E. <i>wroten</i>, vb., as below.</p>

  <p>159. This quotation is also given, in Latin, in Hampole's Pricke of
  Conscience, l. 4671:&mdash;'Siue comedam, siue bibam, siue aliquid aliud
  faciam, semper michi uidetur ilia tuba resonare in auribus meis, Surgite,
  mortui, uenite ad iudicium.' It occurs still earlier, in the Gesta
  Romanorum, cap. 37. It is not really from Jerome, but occurs in the
  Regula Monachorum, in S. Hieron. Opp. tom. v. App.; Paris, 1706. Cf.
  Lyndesay's Monarchè, book iv. l. 5606.</p>

  <p>162. From Rom. xiv. 10.</p>

  <p>164. <i>essoyne</i>, excuse; a common legal term; A. F.
  <i>essoigne</i>, <i>essoyne</i>; See <i>Essoin</i> in my Etym. Dict., 2nd
  ed., Addenda.</p>

  <p>166. 'Nulla ibi dissimilatio, ubi reddenda ratio etiam de verbo
  otioso'; S. Bernardus, Sermo ad Prelatos in Concilio, § 5; ed. Migne,
  vol. 184, col. 1098.</p>

  <p>168. This gives the general sense of Prov. i. 28.</p>

  <p>169. 'O angustiae! Hinc erunt peccata accusantia; inde terrens
  iustitia; subtus patens horridum chaos inferni; desuper iratus iudex;
  intus urens conscientia; foris ardens mundus. Iustus uix saluabitur;
  peccator sic deprehensus in quam partem se premet? Constrictus ubi
  latebo? quomodo parebo? Latere erit impossibile; apparere
  intolerabile.'&mdash;S. Anselmi Meditatio Secunda; ed. Migne, vol. 158,
  col. 724. Cf. St. Bernard, Tractatus de Interiore Domo, cap. 22, § 46;
  Ancren Riwle, p. 304. <!-- Page 451 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page451"></a>[451]</span></p>

  <p>174. This passage from Jerome is probably founded upon Ps. xcvii. 3,
  4.</p>

  <p>176. From Job x. 20-22.</p>

  <p>181. Referring to the quotation above; see 177.</p>

  <p>182. I.&nbsp;e. Job calls it 'dark,' because he that is in hell is deprived
  of natural light. Of course <i>material</i> is here the adjective.</p>

  <p>183. <i>shal turne him al to peyne</i>, shall all become painful to
  him; <i>him</i> is here a dative. In Hampole's Pricke of Conscience, ll.
  6823, 6829, we find the above quotation from Job x. 20-22; and, soon
  after (l. 6879), a quotation from St. Augustine which seems to be here
  imitated:&mdash;'Demones igne scintillante uidebunt.'</p>

  <p>186. <i>defautes</i>, wants, deprivations; <i>agayn</i>, as compared
  with.</p>

  <p>189. Not from Jeremiah, but from 1 Sam. ii. 30; cf. Mal. ii. 9.</p>

  <p>190. <i>fortroden of</i>, trodden down by; see <i>fortreden</i> in
  Stratmann; A. S. <i>fortredan</i>.</p>

  <p>191. This singular quotation is said, in Hampole's Pricke of
  Conscience, l. 8592, to be from the book of Job. The reference is to Job
  xx. 25, where the Vulgate has: 'uadent et uenient super eum horribiles.'
  The word <i>demones</i> is supplied in Hampole before <i>horribiles</i>.
  Even Wycliffe's version has: 'orrible <i>fendis</i> schulen go, and
  schulen come on hym.' A.&nbsp;V. 'terrors are upon him.'</p>

  <p><i>defouled</i>, trodden down. In Ps. cxxxviii. 11, Wycliffe
  has&mdash;'schulen <i>defoule</i> me'; Vulgate, '<i>conculcabunt</i>
  me.'</p>

  <p>193. Chaucer extends this quotation by the insertion of the
  explanatory words about 'the riche folk'; see Ps. lxxvi. 5. <i>oneden
  to</i>, united to, entirely gave up (their hearts) to. The pp.
  <i>oned</i>, united, occurs in D. 1968. See Prompt. Parv. p. 365.</p>

  <p>195. From Deut. xxxii. 24, 33. Cf. Hampole's Pricke of Conscience, l.
  6755.</p>

  <p>198. From Isaiah xiv. 11.</p>

  <p>201. From Micah vii. 6.</p>

  <p>204. The reference is to the Vulgate version of Ps. x. 6 (answering to
  Ps. xi. 6 in the A.&nbsp;V.): 'Qui autem diligit iniquitatem, odit animam
  suam.' Cf. Prov. xxix. 24.</p>

  <p>207. The 'five wits' are the five senses. Cf. P. Plowman, B. xiv.

  <p>208. <i>grintinge</i>, gnashing; cf. Matt. xiii. 42, xxv. 30.</p>

  <p>209. <i>nosethirles</i>, nostrils. This seems to be taken from Jerome;
  for Hampole, in his Pricke of Conscience, l. 6677, says:&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Isaye</i>, Isaiah. The reference is to the Vulgate version of
  Isaiah, xxiv. 9:&mdash;'amara erit potio bibentibus illam.' But I may
  remark, <!-- Page 452 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page452"></a>[452]</span>that the corresponding passage in
  Hampole's Pricke of Conscience refers us, at l. 6770, to Job xx. 16; and
  that the word 'gall' occurs in Job xx. 14.</p>

  <p>210. The reference is to the last verse in Isaiah.</p>

  <p>211. Alluding to Job x. 22, already cited above; see note to 176. The
  Vulgate has:&mdash;'ubi umbra mortis.'</p>

  <p>214. 'Fit ergo miseris mors sine morte, finis sine fine, defectus sine
  defectu, quia et mors uiuit, et finis semper incipit, et deficere
  defectus nescit';&mdash;S. Gregorius, Moralium lib. ix. c. 66; ed. Migne,
  vol. 75, col. 915.</p>

  <p>216. From Rev. ix. 6. Cf. Hampole, Pricke of Conscience, ll. 6723,
  7387.</p>

  <p>217. Referring to the words 'et nullus ordo,' in Job x. 22; see 177
  above.</p>

  <p>218. This seems to have been the usual explanation of the passage. See
  the curious application of this text to the friars in Piers Plowman, B.
  xx. 268.</p>

  <p>220. Referring to Ps. cvii. 34.</p>

  <p>221. St. Basil the Great, bishop of Caesarea (born in 329, died in
  379). The passage alluded to is from his Homilies on the Psalms; on Ps.
  xxviii. 7; § 6.</p>

  <p>223. The same text as that translated above (177) by 'grisly drede
  that ever shal laste.' 'Sempiternus horror inhabitat'; Job x. 22.</p>

  <p>225. This probably refers to the words 'In inferno nulla est
  redemptio,' founded on Job vii. 9; see P. Plowm. C. xxi. 153.</p>

  <p>227. From Prov. xi. 7.</p>

  <p>229-230. I cannot trace these references. Cf. Eccl. i. 18.</p>

  <p>236. From Ezek. xviii. 24.</p>

  <p>248. This seems to be the refrain of a Balade. It is interesting to
  notice that Chaucer again quotes it, as a line of <i>verse</i>, in his
  poem on Fortune; see Minor Poems, x. 7 (vol. i. p. 383).</p>

  <p>252. <i>to paye with his dette</i>, to pay his debt with.</p>

  <p>253-4. This is evidently the same passage from St. Bernard as that
  referred to in Hampole's Pricke of Conscience, l. 5653:&mdash;'Sicut non
  peribit capillus de capite, ita non erit momentum de toto tempore, de quo
  sane non conqueratur.'</p>

  <p>258. <i>mowes</i>, grimaces. '<i>Mowe</i>, or skorne'; Prompt. Parv.
  p. 346. Cf. Troil. iv. 7.</p>

  <p>273. This probably refers to Ps. lxix, which is frequently interpreted
  to refer to the sufferings of Christ; see vv. 7, 9, 18-21.</p>

  <p>281. From Isaiah liii. 5.</p>

  <p>284. From the Vulgate version of John xix. 19.</p>

  <p>286. From Matt. i. 21.</p>

  <p>287. From Acts iv. 12.</p>

  <p>288. <i>Nazarenus</i>, an inhabitant of Nazareth.</p>

  <p>There is a further reference to passages in which the promised Messiah
  is described as a <i>n&#x113;tser</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a 'shoot' or 'sprout,' of
  Jesse. Genesius explains <i>n&#x113;tser</i> as meaning 'a branch,'
  Isaiah xiv. 19, lx. 21; <!-- Page 453 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page453"></a>[453]</span>and, metaphorically, 'a Branch of Jesse,'
  Isaiah xi. 1. This sense of 'branch' or 'sprout' shews the origin of the
  explanation of the word as 'flourishing.'</p>

  <p>289. From Rev. iii. 20.</p>

  <p>300. <i>and nat repente</i>, and (for him) not to repent; used
  substantively, as equivalent to 'non-repentance.' So also <i>repenten
  him</i>, to repent, is equivalent to 'repentance.'</p>

  <p>303. 'Scio enim Deum inimicum omni criminoso'; S. Aug. De Vera
  Poenitentia, cap. ix; Opp. Basil. 1569, tom. iv. col. 1044 C.</p>

  <p>307. Ps. xcvii. 10 (xcvi. 10, in the Vulgate).</p>

  <p>309. From Ps. xxxii. 5. The words <i>that is to seyn</i> are
  superfluous.</p>

  <p>313. <i>sone of ire</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a child of wrath; Eph. ii. 3.</p>

  <p>315. <i>a sory song</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a mournful song.</p>

  <p>316. The subject of this second Chapter, viz. Confession, is
  interrupted, in §§ 23-84, by a long description of the Seven Deadly Sins.
  The subject is resumed in § 85, at p. 634. As to Confession, compare the
  Ancren Riwle, p. 299, and Myre's Instructions for Parish Priests, p.
  24.</p>

  <p>317. <i>And whether it oghte nedes be doon or noon.</i> Here again, as
  in 83 above, Chaucer forgets this clause, and pays no more heed to the
  matter.</p>

  <p>320. Before <i>avaunte</i>, understand <i>he moot</i>; i.&nbsp;e. and (he
  must) not boast of his good works. Compare Ancren Riwle, p. 317; Wyclif's
  Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 255.</p>

  <p>322. From Rom. v. 12.</p>

  <p>326-330. Compare Wycliffe's later version of Gen. iii. 1-7.</p>

  <p>337-340. This agrees rather closely with the Ninth of the Articles of
  Religion.</p>

  <p>341. <i>refreyded</i>, chilled, cooled. Words of Anglo-French origin
  have <i>ey</i> or <i>ei</i> in place of the Central French <i>oi</i>.
  Cotgrave has:&mdash;'<i>Refroidir</i>, to coole, to take away the heat
  of, to slacken, to calme.' Cotgrave also has:&mdash;'<i>Malefice</i>, a
  mischiefe; ... also, a charme (wherby hurt is done); mischievous
  witchery.' It is the same word as the Span. <i>malhecho</i>, mischief,
  and Shakespeare's <i>mallecho</i>; Hamlet, iii. 2. 146.</p>

  <p>342. From Gal. v. 17.</p>

  <p>343. Cf. 2 Cor. xi. 25-27.</p>

  <p>344. From Rom. vii. 24.</p>

  <p>345. This passage refers to St. Jerome's 22nd Epistle to Eustochium,
  De Virginitate, § 7 (ed. Migne, vol. 22. col. 398). A long extract from
  this letter is given in Alban Butler's Lives of the Saints, under Sept.
  30.</p>

  <p>348. From James i. 14.</p>

  <p>349. From 1 John i. 8.</p>

  <p>351. The sense shews that <i>suggestion</i> is really meant; but it
  only appears in MSS. Selden and Lansdowne; all the rest have
  <i>subieccion</i> or <i>subieccioun</i>, which I have therefore retained
  in the text. The fact is, that the words were confused in medieval Latin.
  Ducange gives <i>subjectio</i>, as used for <i>suggestio</i>. However, we
  find the words 'by wikked <i>suggestion</i>' just below, in l. 355.</p>

  <p><i>bely</i>, i.&nbsp;e. bellows; so in all the seven MSS. It is precisely
  the same <!-- Page 454 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page454"></a>[454]</span>word as the mod. E. <i>belly</i>,
  notwithstanding the present difference in sense. The old sense was simply
  'bag'; applied either to an inflated bag for blowing, or to the abdomen.
  The pl. form <i>belies</i> was also used in the double sense, viz. (1) a
  pair of bellows, and (2) bellies; in fact, a pair of bellows is still
  called <i>blow-bellis</i> in some parts of Shropshire; see
  <i>Blow-bellows</i> and <i>Blow-bellys</i> in Miss Jackson's Shropshire

  <p>355. 'Perhaps there may be some such passage in the Rabbinical
  histories of Moses, which the learned Gaulmin published in the last
  century (Paris, 1629, 8vo.), and which, among other traditions, contain
  that alluded to by St. Jude, Epist. 9.'&mdash;Tyrwhitt. An apocryphal
  book, called the Assumption of Moses, is mentioned by Origen.</p>

  <p>358. Wycliffe protested against this attempted distinction between

  <p>362. Hazlitt gives this proverb in the form&mdash;'Many littles make a

  Ray's Proverbs. Another similar proverb is: 'A little leak will sink a
  great ship'; cf. 363.</p>

  <p>363. <i>crevace</i>, crevice. <i>thurrok</i>, the holde of a ship.
  'Thurrok of a schyppe, <i>Sentina</i>'; Prompt. Parv. The following
  remarkable passage occurs in The Myroure of oure Ladye, ed. Blunt (E. E.
  T. S.), pt. ii. pp. 108, 109:&mdash;'Noe [Noah] ioyed that hys Shyppe
  shulde be so pycked [pitched] wyth-in and wyth-out, that there shulde
  [be?] no <i>thorrocke</i> [bilge-water?] that myghte syee [leak, ooze in]
  or droppe in therto. Ye shall vnderstonde that there ys a place in the
  bottome of a shyppe wherein ys gatheryd all the fylthe that cometh in-to
  the shyppe, other by lekynge or by syinge in-to yt by the bourdes, when
  the shyppe is olde, or when yt is not wel pycked, or by eny other wyse.
  And that place stynketh ryghte fowle; and yt ys called in some contre
  [county] of thys londe <i>a thorrocke</i>. Other calle yt an hamron, and
  some calle yt the bulcke of the shyppe. And thys is the <i>thorrocke</i>
  that this Lesson spekyth of. For the shyppe of Noe was soo well pycked,
  that there gatheryd no soche fylthe therin.' It is cognate with Du.
  <i>durk</i>, Mid. Du. <i>durck</i>; Hexham's Du. Dict.
  has:&mdash;'<i>Durck</i> van het schip daer al het water ende vuyligheyt
  in loopt, The Bottom or Sink of a ship where all the water and filth runs
  in.' Sewel's Du. Diet, has:&mdash;'<i>Durk</i> (vuyl scheepswater), The
  foul water at the bottom of a ship.' This shews that the word meant (1)
  the lower part of the hold; and (2) the bilge-water that collects there.
  Probably a still older sense is simply 'hull'; for we find A.&nbsp;S.

  <p>387. Here begins the famous and very common subject of the Seven
  Deadly Sins, largely borrowed from the treatise by Frère Lorens mentioned
  above (p. 447). I give occasional quotations from the French text, marked
  'Fr.,' with references to the pages of Essays on Chaucer, Part V (Chaucer
  Society).</p>

  <p>I here repeat, from my note on P. Plowman, C. vii. 3, some of the
  references to passages in which the Seven Sins appear. See, for instance,
  Ælfric's Homilies, ed. Thorpe, ii. 219; Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii.
  119, 225; The Ancren Riwle, ed. Morton, pp. 198-204; Religious Pieces,
  ed. Perry (E. E. T. S.), pp. 11, 12; the Ayenbite of Inwyt, ed. Morris,
  p. 16; Political, Religious, and Love Poems, ed. Furnivall, p. 215; Hymns
  to the Virgin and Christ, ed. Furnivall, p. 62; Myrc's Instructions for
  Parish Priests, p. 33; Dunbar's Dance of the Seven Deadly Sins; Spenser,
  F.&nbsp;Q. bk. i. c. 4; &amp;c. See also <i>Sins</i> in Nares' Glossary.</p>

  <p>The Seven Sins, in Chaucer's order, are:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Superbia</i>, Pride (p. 591); its 'remedy' is <i>Humilitas</i>,
  Humility.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Inuidia</i>, Envy (p. 598); remedy, <i>Caritas</i>, Love.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Ira</i>, Ire, Wrath (p. 601); remedy, <i>Patientia</i>,
  Patience.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Accidia</i>, Sloth (p. 612); remedy, <i>Fortitudo</i>,
  Strength.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Auaricia</i>, Avarice (p. 617); remedy, <i>Misericordia</i>,
  Pity.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Gula</i>, Gluttony (p. 623); remedy, <i>Abstinentia</i>,
  Abstinence.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Luxuria</i>, Lechery (p. 625); remedy, <i>Castitas</i>,
  Chastity.</p>

  <p><i>springers</i>, origins, sources. I adopted this reading from Hl.,
  because none of the other MSS. make sense. They have <i>spryngen of</i>
  or <i>springen of</i> (Hn. <i>sprynge of</i>), which can only mean 'arise
  from,' thus exactly contradicting the sense intended. Thynne has
  <i>springe of</i>; but Wright, Morris, and Bell all have <i>springers
  of</i>, as they follow the Harl. MS. I know no other example of this rare
  word; and it is difficult to see why the commoner form <i>springes</i>
  would not have served the purpose. Tyrwhitt gets over the difficulty by
  transposing the words, as in the Selden MS., thus reading&mdash;'and of
  hem springen alle,' &amp;c. But the other MSS. do not countenance this
  arrangement.</p>

  <p>388. Pride is usually accounted as the chief of all sins, and the
  source of the rest; cf. Ecclus. x. 13; P. Plowman, C. vii. 3 (B. v. 63),
  and the note; Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 16. <!-- Page 456 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page456"></a>[456]</span></p>

  <p>There is a long passage in St. Gregory's Moralium lib. xxxi. c. 45
  (ed. Migne, vol. 76. col. 621), to which I suppose that later writers
  were much indebted. It is explicitly referred to, for instance, by John
  of Salisbury, in his Policraticus, lib. viii. c. 1. I quote some passages
  from it further on, in suitable places. It begins thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Radix quippe cuncti mali Superbia est. Primae autem ejus soboles,
  septem nimirum principalia vitia, de hac virulenta radice proferuntur,
  scilicet inanis gloria, invidia, ira, tristitia, avaritia, ventris
  ingluvies, luxuria; ... sed habet contra nos haec singula exercitum
  suum.'</p>

  <p>389. <i>hise braunches</i>, its branches. In the Ayenbite of Inwyt, p.
  17, they are called <i>boghes</i>, boughs; and the 'twigs' are called
  <i>little boghes</i>.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>De Superbia.</b></p>

  <p>390. In Essays on Chaucer, p. 510, Dr. Eilers gives a detailed and
  careful comparison of the English with the French text from which it is
  partly derived. The result, through no fault of his, is more bewildering
  than useful; for the numerous alterations in the arrangement of the parts
  of the subject are altogether too tedious to explain. The reader will
  gain the best idea of the state of the case, if I here quote Dr. Eilers'
  summary of his comparison of the two texts, as to their treatment of
  'Pride.' Similar numberless alterations of detail occur in the treatment
  of the other 'Sins.' (Fr. = French text).</p>

  <p>'From the above [comparison] it will appear that a well-ordered scheme
  underlies the French text. <i>Orguel</i> is divided into 7 branches, and
  each of these again into a similar number of <i>reinselez</i>
  (<i>branchettes</i>). Let us examine the English text (Chaucer's) more
  closely. After first pointing out (substantially in agreement with Fr.)
  the impossibility of naming all the parts (<i>twigges</i>) into which
  Pride may be divided, 16 <i>twigges</i> are enumerated, but without that
  logical coherence apparent in Fr. Next follow short definitions of the
  twigs, in which, however, the 11th twig (<i>Strif</i>) is omitted from
  the list, and is added instead at the end, under <i>janglinge</i>, which
  had never been mentioned before. These 16 twigs correspond partly to the
  branches, partly to the <i>reinselez</i> of Fr., whilst some of them are
  not found in Fr. at all, or at least not under the same heading.</p>

  <p>'The definitions correspond only in their general sense with Fr. [Here
  instances are given.]</p>

  <p>'Throughout this part there is in Ch. much confusion of particulars.
  The definition of "swelling of herte" is incorrect. "Arrogaunce" and
  "Presumpcion," which in Fr. are identical, appear in Ch. as distinct
  conceptions. On the other hand, the definitions of some of the words
  resemble each other closely.... The next section, on "a privee spece of
  Pryde" (§ 25), has nothing corresponding to it in Fr.; &amp;c.... In the
  section "whennes Pride sourdeth and springeth" (§ 29), Ch. is in
  tolerably exact accordance with Fr.... The correspondence in this <!--
  Page 457 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page457"></a>[457]</span>first
  Deadly Sin is confined to isolated expressions, points of arrangement
  common to both,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>On account, then, of the complicated differences in the treatment of
  details, I do not think it advisable to give the full and exact results.
  I confine myself to passages in which the Fr. throws real light on the
  English text, and to the points of chief interest only.</p>

  <p>I think it worth while to continue here the quotation from Gregory
  commenced in the note to l. 388 above:&mdash;'Nam de inani gloria
  inobedientia, jactantia, hypocrisis, contentiones, pertinaciae,
  discordiae, et novitatum praesumptiones oriuntur.' Here is the outline of
  the division of Pride into branches. He gives similar 'branches' of
  <i>Inuidia</i>, <i>Ira</i>, and the rest.</p>

  <p>In the Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 17, the first bough of Pride has three
  twigs, as in Fr.; in fact, it follows Fr. <i>very closely</i>, and gives
  a very good idea of its general contents and treatment.</p>

  <p>In the Ancren Riwle, p. 199, 'the Lion of Pride' has 9 whelps, such as
  Vain Glory, Indignation, Hypocrisy, Presumption, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>392. <i>Inobedient</i>, disobedient. Cf. P. Plowman, C. vii. 19;
  Ayenb. (i.&nbsp;e. Ayenbite of Inwyt), p. 20, ll. 7. 8.</p>

  <p>393. <i>Avauntour</i>, boaster; P. Pl. C. vii. 35; Ayenb. p. 22, ll.
  5-15.</p>

  <p>394. <i>Ipocrite</i>, hypocrite. Cf. P. Pl. C. vii. 36-40; Ayenb. p.
  25 (Sixth Bough).</p>

  <p>395. <i>Despitous</i>, scornful; cf. Ayenb. p. 20, ll. 4, 5.
  <i>even-cristene</i>, fellow-Christian; cf. Swed. <i>jämn-christen</i>,
  from <i>jämn</i>, even; Icel. <i>jafnkristinn</i>. <i>Euene-cristene</i>
  occurs in P. Plowm. B. ii. 94, v. 440; also spelt <i>emcristene</i> in
  the same, C. xx. 226, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>398. The definition does not well suit 'Swellinge of herte.' It better
  defines 'the envious man'; see Ayenb. p. 27, l. 15. And see P. 599, l.
  492, below. At the same time, it is not so much out of place as the
  critics say it is, and is paralleled by the lines in P. Plowman, C. vii.
  17, where Pride says that he was&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p style="margin-left:6.2em">'nouht abaissed to agulte</p>
      <p>God and alle good men, <i>so gret was myn herte</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>399. This is parallel to P. Plowm. C. vii. 41-58.</p>

  <p>401. This corresponds to Ayenb. p. 29, l. 19. 'The zixte is, to werri
  zoþnesse be his wytinde.' Fr. 'guerroier verité a son escient.'</p>

  <p>402. <i>Contumax</i>, contumacious; as in P. Plowm. C. xiv. 85.</p>

  <p>403. <i>Surquidrie</i>, presumption; O.F. <i>surquiderie</i>. It
  occurs in the Ancren Riwle, p. 56 (note <i>h</i>); Gawain and the Grene
  Knight, l. 2457; Barbour's Bruce, xi. 11, xvi. 327; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>406. See E. 1200, and the note. Cf. Ayenb. p. 58, l. 13:&mdash;'that
  byeth ase the <i>cleper of the melle</i>, thet ne may him naght hyealde
  stille.' Fr. 'vaines paroles, qui sont come <i>li batels du
  moulin</i>.'</p>

  <p>407. There is nothing in Fr. corresponding to this passage.
  <i>waiteth</i>, i.&nbsp;e. watches his opportunity of being first saluted, or
  of taking a higher seat at table. <i>above him</i>, before him, as in a
  procession. <!-- Page 458 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page458"></a>[458]</span></p>

  <p><i>kisse pax</i>, to kiss the pax. The <i>pax</i> was a small flat
  piece of wood or metal, quite distinct from the <i>pyx</i>, with which it
  is often confounded. See the full explanation in Nares. See also Bingham,
  Antiq. of the Christian Church; and Rock, Church of our Fathers.</p>

  <p><i>goon to offring</i>; see A. 450, and the note.</p>

  <p>411. <i>leefsel</i>, a shady arbour, such as may still be seen before
  an ale-house-door, or a cottage-door, in some country villages. The word
  has already occurred <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'it'."
  >in</span> A. 4061, and has been explained in the note to that line. It
  is quite distinct from the <i>ivy-bush</i> which was so commonly
  suspended in place of, or in addition to, the <i>sign</i> which denoted
  an ale-house; see the chapter on Ale-house Signs in Brand's Pop.
  Antiquities. Perhaps we may assume that the descriptive epithet
  <i>gaye</i> is here of some force; the arbour in front of an inn-door
  would, usually, be either larger or more conspicuous than that in front
  of an ordinary cottage.</p>

  <p>412. This 'outrageous array of clothing' answers to the 'plente des
  beles robes' in Fr.; cf. Ayenb. p. 24, last line but one.</p>

  <p>413. Alluding to Luke xvi. 19. Really from S. Gregorii Homiliarum in
  Evangelia lib. ii. homil. xl. § 3: 'Quodsi uidelicet culpa non esset,
  nequaquam sermo Dei tam uigilanter exprimeret quod diues ... bysso et
  purpura indutus fuisset.' See Migne's ed. vol. 76. col. 1305.</p>

  <p>414. From S. Gregorii Homiliarum in Evangelia lib. ii. homil. 40. § 3:
  'Nemo quippe uestimenta praecipua nisi ad inanem gloriam quaerit,
  uidelicet, ut honorabilior caeteris esse uideatur.' Cf. lib. i. homil.
  vi. § 3 (on the text, Matt. xi. 2-10), where St. Gregory inveighs against
  such as&mdash;'solis exterioribus dediti, praesentis uitae
  <i>mollitiem</i> et <i>delectationem</i> quaerunt ... Nemo ergo existimet
  <i>in fluxu atque studio uestium</i> peccatum deesse;' (ed. Migne, vol.
  76. col. 1097). He proceeds to refer to 1 Pet. iii. 5, 1 Tim. ii. 9.</p>

  <p>415. <i>costlewe</i>, costly. '<i>Costelewe</i>, costfull, costuous,
  <i>Sumptuosus</i>'; Prompt. Parv.; see Way's note. This form answers to
  the Icel. <i>kostligr</i>; and the only difference between the suffixes
  <i><span class="nw">-lewe</span></i> and <i><span
  class="nw">-ly</span></i> is that the former is Norse, and represents
  Icel. <i><span class="nw">-ligr</span></i>, whilst the latter represents
  the A.&nbsp;S. <i><span class="nw">-lic</span></i>. See <i>Chokelew</i> in the
  New Eng. Dict., and cf. <i>drunken-lewe</i>, drunken-like,
  <i>sik-lewe</i>, sickly.</p>

  <p>416. Wyclif (Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 124) is similarly severe against
  proud array.</p>

  <p>417. <i>degyse</i>, fashionable; O. F. <i>desguisè</i>, also spelt
  <i>desguisiè</i> (Godefroy). Chaucer found this word in Le Roman de la
  Rose, l. 827; see vol. i. p. 128.</p>

  <p><i>endentinge</i>, notching, or the use of indented lines.
  <i>Indentee</i> (better <i>endentee</i>) is still a term in heraldry, to
  signify that an edge or dividing line is notched or serrated, as shewn in
  any heraldic work. Several of the terms in this clause have, in heraldry,
  a special sense, and Chaucer seems to be thinking, in particular, of such
  coats-of-arms as were sometimes made of variously coloured cloths, cut
  into the requisite shapes. <!-- Page 459 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page459"></a>[459]</span></p>

  <p><i>barringe</i>, cutting into stripes, or decoration with <i>bars</i>.
  A <i>bar</i>, in heraldry, is a horizontal stripe like the <i>fess</i>,
  but narrower.</p>

  <p><i>oundinge</i>, waving; decoration by the use of waved lines.
  <i>Oundee</i> or <i>oundy</i> (also <i>onde</i>, <i>ondy</i>) is the
  heraldic name for a waved line or edge. Criseyde's hair was
  <i>ounded</i>, i.&nbsp;e. waved; Troilus, iv. 736.</p>

  <p><i>palinge</i>, decoration with a 'pale' or upright stripe. A
  <i>pale</i>, in heraldry, is a broad upright stripe, occupying the third
  part of the field. Cf. note to HF. 1840 (vol. iii. p. 282).</p>

  <p><i>windinge</i>, twisting; decoration with curved lines. Many heraldic
  charges, such as a lion, had to be cut out in the cloth, by 'winding' the
  scissors about, along the outline required.</p>

  <p><i>bendinge</i>, decoration with bends. A <i>bend</i>, in heraldry, is
  a slanting stripe or band. The <i>bend dexter</i> is drawn from the
  dexter chief to the sinister base of the shield; the <i>bend sinister</i>
  (once a mark of bastardy) slopes the other way.</p>

  <p>418. <i>pounsoninge</i>, punching, perforation. Strictly, the use of a
  <i>puncheon</i> or perforating implement. '<i>Punchon</i>, stimulus,
  punctorium'; Prompt. Parv.</p>

  <p><i>chisels</i>, i.&nbsp;e. cutting instruments; we may note that,
  etymologically, <i>chisels</i> and <i>scissors</i> (M. E.
  <i>cisoures</i>) are closely related words.</p>

  <p><i>dagginge</i>, slitting, snipping, cutting into strips or narrow
  flapping ends. There is a special allusion to the custom of
  <i>dagging</i>, i.&nbsp;e. jagging, or foliating the edges of robes
  (especially of the sleeves), so common in the reigns of Edw. III. and
  Rich. II. See fig. 91 in Fairholt's Costume in England (1885), i. 124.
  See P. Plowman, C. xxiii. 143; Rich. the Redeless, iii. 193.</p>

  <p>419. The length of the trains of gowns is a common subject of satire.
  See, in particular, Sir David Lyndesay's Minor Poems (E. E. T. S.), pp.
  574-5.</p>

  <p>421. <i>bete</i>, remedy, amend, better, relieve; cf. A. 2253.</p>

  <p>422. <i>cutted</i>, cut short; see Leg. G. Women, 973, and note.</p>

  <p><i>sloppes</i>, garments; here, evidently, jackets of a short length.
  '<i>Sloppe</i>, garment, <i>Mutatorium</i>'; Prompt. Parv.; Icel.
  <i>sloppr</i>, a robe, gown. There is a parallel passage in the Knight of
  La Tour-Landry, cap. xlvii (p. 63). Cf. <i>oversloppe</i>, G. 633.</p>

  <p><i>hainselins</i> (also spelt <i>hanselins</i>, <i>anslets</i>), the
  same as <i>sloppes</i>, i.&nbsp;e. jackets. Tyrwhitt unluckily says that 'it
  appears from the context to mean <i>a sort of breeches</i>,' whereas it
  was the shortness of the <i>hainselin</i> that enabled the breeches to be
  seen; and his error has been copied by others. This most unusual word
  answers to the rare O.&nbsp;F. <i>hamselin</i>, <i>hamcellim</i>, or
  <i>hainselin</i>, a sort of robe. Godefroy says&mdash;'sorte de robe
  <i>longue</i>'; whereas it was certainly 'courte.' His examples include
  the mention of 'un hainselin de vert brun' in 1416, 'hamselin' in 1403,
  and an extract from Christine de Pisan:&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 460 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page460"></a>[460]</span></p>

  <p>I suppose the last line means 'tightly gathered in above the hips.'
  Cotgrave has: '<i>sus</i>, above.' The word is probably of Frankish
  origin; from O. H. G. *<i>hemithil&#x12B;n</i>, M. H. G.
  <i>hemdel&#x12B;n</i>, dimin. of O. H. G. <i>hemithi</i>, a shirt (G.
  <i>Hema</i>). See Fig. 93 and Fig. 136 in Fairholt's Costume, i. 126,
  180.</p>

  <p>425. <i>degysinge</i>, mode of dress. This alludes to the singular
  habit of wearing parti-coloured dresses; see the remarks in Fairholt's
  Costume, i. 114, 115.</p>

  <p>427. <i>fyr of seint Anthony</i>, St. Anthony's fire; a popular name
  for erysipelas, which this saint was supposed to cure.</p>

  <p>429. <i>honestetee</i>, decency; as in B. 3908. In 431, it seems to
  mean 'neatness'; and so in 436.</p>

  <p>432. <i>aornement</i>, the O. F. form of 'adornment'; see
  <i>Adornment</i> in the New E. Dict., in which the oldest quotation for
  this form is from Caxton. The expression 'in thinges that apertenen to
  rydinge' answers to 'his uaire ridinges' in Ayenb. p. 24, l. 3 from
  bottom; Fr. 'beles chevauchures.'</p>

  <p>434. From Zech. x. 5.</p>

  <p>435. This curiously expresses the view taken by the lower orders in
  England, who regarded the riders, mostly Normans, as belonging to the
  class of their oppressors. Hence the curious song against the Retinues of
  the Rich, in Wright's Political Songs, pp. 237-240.</p>

  <p>437. <i>greet meinee</i>, a large household; 'the uayre mayné,' Ayenb.
  p. 24, l. 31; Fr. 'bele maisnie.'</p>

  <p>440. As 'thilke that holden hostelries,' i.&nbsp;e. innkeepers, are here
  represented as upholding the cheating ways of the 'hostilers,' the latter
  must here be used (like mod. E. <i>ostler</i>) in the sense of the
  servants attached to the inn. In A. 241, <i>hostiler</i> may mean the
  innkeeper himself; but ostler goes well with <i>tappestere</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
  barmaid.</p>

  <p>442. From Ps. lv. 15.</p>

  <p>445. <i>wilde fyr</i>, fire caused by kindling some inflammable
  spirit, just as our modern 'Christmas pudding' or 'mince pie' is
  surrounded with the flames of burning brandy. It seems to have been
  called 'wild fire' as being not easily extinguishable, like the 'Greek
  fire' of the middle ages; see Ancren Riwle, p. 402, and Warton's note,
  Hist. Eng. Poetry, ed. 1871, ii. 154. In A. 4172, and E. 2252, it is
  used, metaphorically, to denote 'erysipelas.'</p>

  <p>446. <i>vessel</i>, a collective noun, like mod. E. 'plate.' As to
  minstrelsy at feasts, see E. 1178, F. 268, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>448. <i>sourden of</i>, arise from, have their <i>source</i> in; F.
  <i>sourdre</i>.</p>

  <p>450-5. Here the E. text is tolerably close to the Fr. original; cf.
  Ayenb. p. 24. The 'goodes' are <i>Li bien de nature</i>, being such as
  are (1) <i>devers le cors</i>, viz. <i>sainteté</i> (good health),
  <i>biauté</i>, <i>force</i>, <i>proesce</i>, <i>noblesce</i>, <i>bone
  langue</i>, <i>bone voiz</i>; and (2) <i>devers l'ame</i>, viz. <i>cler
  sens</i>, <i>soutil engin</i>, <i>bone memoire</i>, <i>les vertuz
  natureles</i>. Again, there are <i>Li bien de fortune</i>, viz.
  <i>hautesces</i>, <i>honors</i>, <i>richesces</i>, <i>delices</i>,
  <i>prosperitez</i>. Lastly, there are <i>Li bien de grace</i>, viz.
  <i>vertuz</i>, <i>bones &oelig;vres</i>. <!-- Page 461 --><span

  <p>459. Alluding to Gal. v. 17; see Wyclif's version.</p>

  <p>460. <i>causeth ... meschaunce</i>, often brings many a man into peril
  and misfortune. The idiom is curious; but all the MSS. agree here, and
  Thynne's edition has the same. Tyrwhitt has 'causeth ful oft to many man
  peril,' &amp;c. This is easier, but lacks authority.</p>

  <p>467. Chaucer found this quotation from Seneca in the Latin treatise
  which is the original of 'Melibeus' (p. 124 of Sundby's edition), though
  the passage does not occur in his version of that tale. It is made up of
  two clauses, taken, respectively, from Seneca, De Clementia, i. 3. 3, and
  the same, i. 19. 2. 'Nullum clementia magis decet quam regem'; et iterum,
  'Iracundissimae et parui corporis sunt apes, rex tamen earum sine aculeo
  est.' Cf. Pliny, Nat. History, bk. xi. c. 17; Batman upon Bartholomè, bk.
  xviii. c. 12; Hoccleve, de Regimine Principum, p. 121; Brunetto Latini,
  Li Livres dou Tresor, i. v. 155.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it is remarkable that Chaucer's words resemble even
  more closely a passage from Cicero which is quoted on the preceding page
  of the same book:&mdash;'Nam Tullius dixit: Nihil est laudabilius, nihil
  magno et praeclaro viro dignius placabilitate atque clementia'; De
  Officiis, i. 25.</p>

  <p>470. Here there is a slight change in the order; the 'goods of grace'
  are discussed <i>before</i> those of 'fortune'; see 454, 455.</p>

  <p>473. Cf. the Clerkes Tale, E. 1000.</p>

  <p>475. In the Fr. treatise, all the Sins come first, and then the
  Remedies are discussed afterwards. The alteration in this respect is an
  improvement.</p>

  <p>476. <i>mekenesse</i>; called 'Mildenesse' in Ayenb. p. 130, and
  'umilite' in Fr. The resemblance of this § 29 to the Fr. text is very
  slight.</p>

  <p>483. <i>to stonde gladly to</i>, willingly to abide by.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>De Inuidia.</b></p>

  <p>484. See Ayenb. 26; Myrc's Instructions to Parish Priests, p. 37; P.
  Plowm. C. vii. 63 (B. v. 76); Ancren Riwle, p. 200; Wyclif's Works, ed.
  Arnold, iii. 128. In form and general contents, this chapter on Envy is a
  condensation of the corresponding chapter in the Fr. text, but there are
  several deviations.</p>

  <p><i>philosophre</i>; I do not know who is meant. However, St. Gregory
  (see the note to 388) says: 'De <i>inuidia</i>, odium, susurratio,
  detractio, <i>exsultatio in aduersis proximi, afflictio autem in
  prosperis</i> nascitur.'</p>

  <p><i>Augustin.</i> The quotation seems rather to follow the words of St.
  Gregory just quoted. I find, in St. Augustine, only <i>one</i> of the
  clauses, viz. 'Inuidia est enim odium felicitatis alienae'; S. Aug. in
  Psalm. civ. 25 (cv. 25 in the Vulgate); ed. Migne, vol. 37, col. 1399.
  This is the very quotation which has already done duty in the Phisicien's
  Tale; see C. 115, and the note. Cf. P. Plowm. B. v. 112, 113.</p>

  <p>485. <i>platly</i>, &amp;c.; Fr. 'il est contraires an saint esperit.'

  <p>486. <i>two</i>; Dr. Eilers remarks&mdash;'Clearly <i>three</i>
  follow.' But we can easily count them as <i>two</i>; (1) hardness of
  heart; (2) warring against truth, or against grace given to one's
  neighbour.</p>

  <p>526. From Matt. v. 44.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>De Ira.</b></p>

  <p>532. 'The first part of this chapter is, in arrangement as in

  found in Fr. ... the verbal coincidences are very numerous.'&mdash;Essays

  xvii. c. 7; ed. Migne, vol. 82, col. 615. This is one of Isidore's
  delicious 'etymologies.' This remarkable story is founded on the
  imaginary fact that <i>juniper</i> is derived from the Gk. <span

  <p>562. <i>hate</i>, &amp;c. This expression is from St.
  Augustine:&mdash;'Quid est odium? ira inueterata. Ira inuerata si facta
  est, iam odium dicitur'; Sermo lviii. c. 7; ed. Migne, vol. 38, col.
  397.</p>

  <p>565. <i>six thinges</i>; evidently an error for <i>three</i>. The
  three are: (1) hate; (2) backbiting; (3) deceitful counsel. The error may
  easily have arisen from misreading <i>iij</i> as <i>uj</i>. Most of the
  MSS. have '.vj.'; but '.ui.' and '.uj.' were also in use. See 1 John iii.
  15.</p>

  <p>566. Probably due to an imperfect remembrance of Prov. xxv.
  18:&mdash;'Iaculum, et gladius, et sagitta acuta, homo qui loquitur
  contra proximum suum falsum testimonium.' Cf. xii. 18, xxx. 14.</p>

  <p>568. From Prov. xxviii. 15; cf. iii. 27.</p>

  <p><i>shepe</i>, hire, is a rare word; hence the addition, either by
  Chaucer or by a scribe, of the words <i>or the hyre</i>, by way of a
  gloss. The writer of the Ayenbite writes <i>ss</i> for <i>sh</i>; and we
  there find the word <i>ssepe</i>, in the sense of 'hire' or 'pay,' no
  less than five times; at pp. 33, 40, 86, 113, 146, also the pl.
  <i>ssepes</i>, wages, at p. 39. Cf. A.&nbsp;S. <i>scipe</i>, pay, in Ælfric's

  Anelida, 193.</p>

  <p>569. From Prov. xxv. 21.</p>

  <p>572. <i>in his defendaunt</i>, in his (own) defence; it looks like an

  <p><i>bacins ful of water.</i> These were sometimes used, instead of <!--
  Page 464 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page464"></a>[464]</span>looking-glasses, for divination; Brand,
  Pop. Antiq. ed. Ellis, iii. 169. This kind of divination was called
  catoptromancy.</p>

  <p><i>bright swerd</i>, used, instead of a magic mirror, in
  catoptromancy; see Brand.</p>

  <p><i>in a cercle.</i> Circles were almost invariably drawn upon the
  ground by sorcerers, within which the invoked spirit was supposed to be
  confined; see Brand, iii. 56, 59.</p>

  <p><i>in a fyr</i>, as in pyromancy. 'Amphiaraus was the first that had
  knowledge in Pyromancie, and gathered signs by speculation of fire';
  Holland, tr. of Pliny, bk. vii. c. 56. Cf. P. Plowman, A. xi. 158.</p>

  <p>'Magic may be practised after diuers sorts; ... for it worketh by the

  <p><i>shulder-boon.</i> See Pard. Tale, C. 351, and the note. Brand, in
  his Pop. Antiq., has a chapter on Divination by the Speal [rather
  Spaule], or Blade-bone. In Miss Burne's Shropshire Folk-Lore, p. 179, we
  are referred to Tylor, Prim. Culture, i. 124; Folk-Lore Record, i. 176;
  Henderson, Folk-Lore, p. 175.</p>

  <p>605. <i>divynailes</i>, divinations. '<i>Devinailles</i>, f.
  Divinations, predictions'; Cotgrave.</p>

  <p><i>flight of briddes.</i> This form of divination, so well known to
  the Romans, is still kept in remembrance by the use of the words
  <i>augury</i> and <i>auspice</i>. Divinations by beasts were common and
  various; the commonest method was by inspecting the entrails of a beast
  when sacrificed. See Brand's chapter on Omens, as e.g. by the howling of
  dogs, by cats, birds, animals crossing one's path, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>sort</i>, lot; as by the Virgilian lots, Bible lots, &amp;c.; see
  Brand, Pop. Antiq. iii. 336; Sir T. Browne, Vulgar Errors, bk. v. c. 24,
  § 7; Gay, Shepherd's Week, Pastoral 4.</p>

  <p><i>geomancie</i>, divination by dots made with a pointed stick in
  dust, &amp;c. See the note on A. 2043, above. Divination by dreams needs
  no remark.</p>

  <p><i>chirkinge</i>, creaking. Strange noises have often caused
  superstitious terrors; a familiar instance is that of the death-watch.
  They are also sometimes regarded, with less evil effect, and perhaps,
  occasionally, with some truth, as weather-omens.</p>

  <p>See Gay's Trivia, bk. i. l. 157; and the well-known Signs of Rain, by
  Dr. Jennings.</p>

  <p><i>gnawynge of rattes.</i> See Brand, Popular Antiq. iii. 188.</p>

  <p>607. <i>Charmes.</i> See examples in Brand, Pop. Antiquities, of Rural
  Charms, Characts, and Amulets. It is curious to note Chaucer's qualified
  belief in them.</p>

  <p>609. Cf. Fr. 'unes menconges aidans, ... unes nuisans, ... por faire
  domage a autrui.'</p>

  <p>611. <i>Som lesinge</i>, &amp;c.; 'some (kind of) lying arises,
  because a man <!-- Page 465 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page465"></a>[465]</span>wants to sustain (the credit of) his
  word.' Dr. Eilers marks <i>he</i> with the note&mdash;'grammatical
  error.' But it is quite right; <i>he</i> is used indefinitely, as
  frequently. It is just a little too bad to charge this as an error on the
  author.</p>

  <p>612. The mention of flattery seems out of place. But, as Dr. Eilers
  says, we may well suppose that 'the English author, once having had
  recourse to the "pecchiez de male langue," exhausted its whole contents,
  perhaps intentionally, perhaps unintentionally, but certainly with no
  regard to the subject of anger.' If we turn to the Ayenbite, p. 57, we
  shall find that the sins of the tongue, including flattery, are there
  given at the end of the section on Gluttony, where their appearance is
  even more surprising. The fact is, that the grouping of all sins under
  the Seven Deadly Sins is extremely artificial, and there is no particular
  place for the insertion of flattery or of certain other sins. Moreover,
  in 618 below, Chaucer naively gives his reason for the arrangement which
  he has adopted.</p>

  <p>613. Fr. 'Li losengier sont les norrices au diable, qui ses enfans
  alaitent et endorment en leur pecchies ... par lor biau chanter.' The
  same expression occurs in the Ayenbite of Inwyt, p. 60, l. 7.</p>

  <p>614. <i>Salomon.</i> Chaucer gives the general sense of Prov. xxviii.
  23.</p>

  <p>615. Fr. 'les apele l'escripture <i>enchanteors</i>, car il enchantent
  tant l'ome que il les croit plus que soi meismes.' The Ayenbite has
  'charmeres'; p. 60, l. 25.</p>

  <p>616. Following Tyrwhitt, I have supplied the words between square
  brackets, which are wanting in all the seven MSS. and in Thynne's
  edition. Tyrwhitt supplies 'god; and thise flatereres betrayen.' But he
  does not tell us where (if anywhere) he found these words.</p>

  <p>617. The Fr. text has the very expression 'quant il chantent touz jors
  <i>Placebo</i>.' The Ayenbite adds an explanation (p. 60, l. 7 from
  bottom): viz. they all sing <i>Placebo</i>, that is to say, 'my lord
  saith truth,' or 'my lord doth well'; and turn to good all that the
  master doth or saith, whether it be good or bad. See my note to P.
  Plowman, C. iv. 467.</p>

  <p>Note the name <i>Placebo</i> in the Marchauntes Tale; see E. 1476.</p>

  <p>619. Fr. 'Apres vienent les maudicons.... E saint Pol dist que tieus
  genz ne poent le regne Dieu avoir.' This refers to 1 Cor. vi. 10, where
  the Vulgate has: 'neque <i>maledici</i> (A. V. 'revilers') ... regnum Dei
  possidebunt.' So in Ayenb. p. 66, l. 22.</p>

  <p>620. Not in the Fr. text. This is an old proverb, which Southey
  quotes, in a Greek form, as a motto prefixed to his Curse of Kehama. His
  English version of it is:&mdash;'curses are like young chickens, they
  always come home to roost.'</p>

  <p>623. <i>gospel.</i> See Matt. v. 22, 44.</p>

  <p>624. Fr. 'on reproche à l'ome ou ses pecchiez, ou ses folies, ou sa
  povrete, ou ses povres parenz, ou aucune defaute qu'il a en lui.' Cf.
  Ayenb. p. 66, l. 27.</p>

  <p><i>mesel</i>, leper; so <i>meselrie</i>, leprosy, in 625.</p>

  <p>625. <i>maheym</i>, maim, i.&nbsp;e. mutilation or bodily imperfection. Our
  <!-- Page 466 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page466"></a>[466]</span><i>maim</i> is a contracted form of this
  M.&nbsp;E. <i>maheym</i>. In P. Plowman, B. xvii. 189, one MS. has
  <i>y-mayheymed</i>, where others have <i>y-maymed</i>. In Britton, i. 98,
  the Anglo-French form is <i>maheyng</i>; in the Liber Albus, p. 281, it
  is <i>mahaym</i>.</p>

  <p>627. From Matt. xii. 34.</p>

  <p>629. From Prov. xv. 4.</p>

  <p><i>deslavee</i>, lit. 'unwashed,' foul; from O. F. '<i>deslaver</i>,
  v. a. salir, souiller; fig., souiller, ternir la reputation de
  quelqu'un'; Godefroy. The pp. <i>deslave</i> properly means: 'non lavé,
  crasseux, sale.' Chaucer seems to confuse this with the transitive sense
  of the active verb; and he evidently had in mind the above verse from the
  Proverbs, where the Vulgate has 'Lingua placabilis, lignum uitae; quae
  autem <i>immoderata</i> est, conteret spiritum.' Hence <i>deslavee</i>
  here means 'unbridled.'</p>

  <p>630. From 2 Tim. ii. 24.</p>

  <p>631. From Prov. xxvii. 15; the Vulgate has 'Tecta perstillantia.' Cf.
  Prov. xix. 13; and note to D. 278.</p>

  <p>633. From Prov. xvii. 1. Below, see Col. iii. 18.</p>

  <p>636. See Ayenb., p. 187. The toad was considered poisonous, and wine
  was an antidote. Hence the antipathy.</p>

  <p>639. See 2 Sam. xvii. 1.</p>

  <p>640. <i>fals livinge</i>, false liver, evil liver.</p>

  <p>642-3. This passage resembles the Fr. text.</p>

  <p>649. From Ecclesiastes, v. 3.</p>

  <p>651. <i>deffendeth</i>, forbids; see Eph. v. 4.</p>

  <p>654. The word <i>Mansuetude</i> is borrowed from the Fr. text.</p>

  <p>657. Jerome seems to be quoting 1 Cor. xiii. 4, 5.</p>

  <p>660. Compare Boethius, bk. ii. pr. 7. ll. 91, 92 (vol. ii. p. 48).</p>

  <p>661. Mat. v. 9. Cf. Frank. Tale, F. 773, and the note. The 'wise man'
  is Dionysius Cato, who says:&mdash;'Quem superare potes, interdum uince
  ferendo,' sometimes altered to 'superare <i>nequis, patienter</i>,'
  &amp;c.; Distich. i. 38.</p>

  <p>664. From Prov. xxix. 9.</p>

  <p>670. This example somewhat resembles a story in Seneca, De Ira, lib.

  &amp;c.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>De Accidia.</b></p>

  <p>677. The description of Sloth answers to the description in the Fr.
  text chiefly as regards the general outline. The particular points of
  contact are few. Cf. Ayenb. of Inwyt, pp. 31-34.</p>

  <p>678. This remark, from Augustine, properly applies to the sin of Envy;
  see note to 484 above; p. 461.</p>

  <p>679. <i>Salomon</i>; with reference to Eccl. ix. 10.</p>

  <p>680. See Jer. xlviii. 10; for 'necligently,' the Vulg. has
  'fraudulenter'; A. V. 'deceitfully.'</p>

  <p>687. Referring, probably, to Rev. iii. 16.</p>

  <p>688. Cf. Prov. xx. 4; xxi. 25. <!-- Page 467 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page467"></a>[467]</span></p>

  <p>693. <i>wanhope</i>, despair; as in the parallel passage in the Ayenb.
  p. 34, l. 12. Cf. P. Plowman, C. viii. 59, 81, and note.</p>

  <p>694. 'Quidam enim in peccata prolapsi desperatione plus pereunt'; S.
  Aug. De Natura et Gratia, cap. 35; ed. Migne, xliv. 266. A similar
  passage occurs in his Sermo xx. § 3; ed. Migne, xxxviii. 140.</p>

  <p>698. The words <i>recreant</i> and <i>creant</i> are, curiously
  enough, used in almost exactly the same sense; perhaps <i>creant</i> was
  merely an abbreviated form. To 'say <i>creant</i>' and to 'yield oneself
  <i>recreant</i>' meant, 'to own oneself beaten'; the original sense
  being, apparently, 'to entrust oneself to the enemy' or confide in him,
  in the hope of obtaining mercy; see the explanation of <i>se
  recredere</i> in Ducange, and <i>recreant</i> and <i>recroire</i> in
  Godefroy. The E. phrase is well illustrated by P. Plowman, B. xii. 193,
  xviii. 100; see <i>creant</i> in the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>700-703. Alluding to Luke xv. 7; xv. 24; xxiii. 42, 43.</p>

  <p>705. From Matt. vii. 7, John xvi. 24; compare Wyclif's version.</p>

  <p>707. <i>by the morwe</i>, early in the morning; cf. D. 755, H. 16; and
  D. 1080.</p>

  <p>709. From Prov. viii. 17.</p>

  <p>712. From the Vulgate, Eccl. vii. 19 (18):&mdash;'qui timet Deum,
  nihil negligit.'</p>

  <p>714. Cf. G. 3, and note; also Ayenb. p. 31, ll. 20-22.</p>

  <p>715. <i>thurrok</i>, the sink in which all evil things collect; see
  note to 363, above, p. 454.</p>

  <p>716. Cf. Matt. xi. 12. The reference to 'David' is to Ps. lxxiii. 5
  (lxxii. 5 in the Vulgate):&mdash;'In labore hominum non sunt, et cum
  hominibus non flagellabuntur.' See the comment on this verse in Hampole's
  Psalter, ed. Bramley; which concludes with:&mdash;'for with men whaym God
  drawes to heven thai sal nought be swongen, but with fendes in hell.'</p>

  <p>718. <i>latrede</i>, tardy (very rare); A. S. læt-r&#x1E3;de, slow of
  counsel, deliberate (see Toller).</p>

  <p><i>dich</i>, ditch. In the Fr. text, the image is that of a prisoner,
  who, when the door is open, is too lazy to mount the steps; so in Ayenb.
  p. 32, l. 2. Cf. P. Plowman, C. xiv. 236, 237.</p>

  <p>719. Cf. Ayenb. p. 32, l. 21:&mdash;'thou sselt libbe long'; also P.
  Pl. C. xii. 180; Prov. of Hendyng, l. 304.</p>

  <p>723. This is something like the Fr. text; see Ayenb. p. 33, l. 14. But
  the Fr. text does not quote St. Bernard. The passage in St. Bernard seems
  to be one in his Vitis Mystica, cap. xix. § 66; ed. Migne, vol. clxxxiv.
  coll. 674, 675: 'Aliquando affligitur hoc uitio anima bonorum,... ut nec
  orare, nec legere, nec meditari, nec opus manuum libeat exercere.'</p>

  <p>725. <i>tristicia.</i> The Fr. text has <i>tristesce</i>, translated
  by 'zor&#x21D;e' in the Ayenbite, p. 34, l. 8; see 2 Cor. vii. 10.</p>

  <p>728. Fr. text&mdash;'La vertu de proesce'; Ayenb.&mdash;'uirtue' and
  'prouesse,' p. 163, l. 22. <i>Fortitude</i> is one of the four cardinal
  virtues; P. Plowman, C. xxii. 289. <!-- Page 468 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page468"></a>[468]</span></p>

  <p>731. The 'speces,' or kinds, are here five, viz. magnanimity, faith,
  surety, magnificence, and constancy. These are taken from the Fr. text,
  which gives <i>six</i> kinds, viz. magnanimite, fiance, seurte,
  <i>pacience</i>, magnificence, constaunce. <i>Patience</i> is omitted, as
  having occurred above; see 659.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>De Auaricia.</b></p>

  <p>739. In this section we again find several hints taken from the Fr.
  text, especially in the arrangement of the subdivisions; cf. Ayenb. pp.
  34-45. The text of St. Paul is quoted in the original, and in the Ayenb.
  p. 34; see note to C. 334, and cf. 1 Tim. vi. 10.</p>

  <p>741. 'Amor mundi, amor huius saeculi, cupiditas dicitur'; S. Augustini
  enarratio in Psalmum xxxi, part ii. § 5; ed. Migne, vol. 36, col.
  260.</p>

  <p>748. 'Auarus, quod est idolorum seruitus'; Eph. v. 5.</p>

  <p>749. <i>mawmet</i>, idol. It was unjustly supposed that Mahometans
  worshipped the prophet; whence <i>Mahomet</i>, corrupted to
  <i>mawmet</i>, came to mean an idol in general. See Marco Polo, ed. Yule,
  i. 174, for illustrations.</p>

  <p>751. 'Non habebis deos alienos coram me. Non facies tibi sculptile';
  Exod. xx. 3, 4. The addition of the second clause, taken from the second
  commandment, is remarkable. It was quite common to omit the second
  commandment altogether; cf. note to C. 641. Cf. Ayenb. pp. 5, 6.</p>

  <p>752. <i>tailages</i>, &amp;c. The Fr. text has:&mdash;'par tallies,
  par corvees, par emprunz, par mauvaises coustumes,' &amp;c.; cf. 'be
  tailes, be coruees, be lones, be kueade wones'; Ayenb. p. 38. Cowel
  explains <i>tallage</i> as 'a tribute, toll, or tax.' It was, in fact, an
  exaction for which a <i>tally</i>, or acknowledgement (upon a notched
  stick) was given; see note to P. Plowman, B. iv. 57; and cf. Chaucer's
  Prologue, 570; P. Plowman, C. xxii. 37.</p>

  <p>Dr. Murray explains <i>cariage</i> in this passage as meaning 'an
  obsolete service of carrying, or a payment in lieu of the same, due by a
  tenant to his landlord or feudal superior, or imposed by authority.'</p>

  <p><i>amerciments</i>, arbitrary fines inflicted 'at the mercy' of an
  affeeror. If the affeeror had no mercy, they became, as is here said,
  mere extortions.</p>

  <p>754. The reference is given to Augustine's De Civitate Dei, lib. ix.;
  but is wrong. It should be to lib. xix. c. 15:&mdash;'Prima ergo
  seruitutis caussa peccatum est.'</p>

  <p>755. See Gen. ix. 18-27. The reference to Gen. v. is a mistake,
  perhaps due to the fact that Ham is first mentioned in that chapter, at
  the end of it. See 766 below.</p>

  <p>759. This is from Seneca, Epist. 47, which begins:&mdash;'Libenter ex
  his, qui a te ueniunt, cognoui, familiariter te cum seruis tuis uiuere;
  hoc prudentiam tuam, hoc eruditionem decet. Serui sunt? immo homines.
  Serui sunt? immo contubernales.' <!-- Page 469 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page469"></a>[469]</span></p>

  <p>760. <i>contubernial with</i>, dwelling together with, intimate with.
  Chaucer found the word in Seneca; see the last note.</p>

  <p>761-3. The general sense of this passage is from Seneca, Epist. 47
  (note to 759). Thus the words 'that they rather love thee than drede'
  answer to 'Colant [serui] potius te, quam timeant.'</p>

  <p>766. See Gen. ix. 26, and note to 755.</p>

  <p>767-8. Cf. Ayenb. p. 39, ll. 6-9; P. Pl. B. vi. 28. The Fr. Text
  has:&mdash;'ces gran prelaz qui acrochent ... par trop grans procuracions
  ... ce sont li lou qui manguent les berbiz.' It does not mention St.
  Austin.</p>

  <p>783. So in Fr. text; see Ayenb. p. 41, near the bottom. See also the
  parallel passage in Wyclif's Works, ed. Matthew, p. 64.</p>

  <p>788. <i>Damasie</i>; Damasus I., pope from 336 to 384. His day is
  December 11. St. Jerome (Epist. 61, c. 3) tells us that a Roman senator,
  envious of the pomp sometimes observed in church ceremonies, said to pope
  Damasus, 'Make me bishop of Rome, and I will be a Christian tomorrow.'
  (Alban Butler.)</p>

  <p>793. See Pard. Tale, C. 590; Ayenb. p. 45, l. 13.</p>

  <p>797. Cf. 'ualse notaryes'; Ayenb. p. 40, l. 8; and see 'Susannah' in
  the Apocrypha, as told in Dan. xiii., in the Vulgate version.</p>

  <p>799. <i>Corporel</i>, bodily theft; see Ayenb. p. 37, l. 3.</p>

  <p>801. <i>Sacrilege</i>; see Ayenb. p. 40, l. 26. <i>chirche-hawes</i>,
  church-yards; Fr. 'mostiers, ou sainz leus, <i>cymetieres</i>'; Ayenb.
  (p. 41)&mdash;'cherches, other holi stedes, <i>cherchtounes</i>.'</p>

  <p>802. See Ayenb. p. 41, ll. 7-20. The concluding portion of this
  section resembles the Fr. text more closely than usual.</p>

  <p>Dr. Eilers proposes to insert the words <i>rentes and</i> before
  <i>rightes</i>, because the Fr. text has 'les rentes ... e les autres
  droitures'; and it is remarkable that Tyrwhitt also inserts these words.
  But they neither appear in any of the seven MSS., nor in Thynne's
  edition.</p>

  <p>804. <i>misericorde</i> answers to 'merci' in Ayenb. p. 185, l.
  26.</p>

  <p>811. <i>largesse</i>, bounty; so also in Ayenb. p. 188, l. 4.</p>

  <p>813. <i>fool-largesse</i>, foolish prodigality, such as is satirised
  in P. Plowm. C. viii. 82-101.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>De Gula.</b></p>

  <p>818. This section has very little in common with the Fr. Text; cf.
  Ayenb. p. 50. It is also much shorter than the original.</p>

  <p>819-20. <i>Adam</i>; mentioned also in Fr. text; see Ayenb. p. 50, l.
  8 from bottom. See Pard. Tale, C. 505, and the note; also C. 529, and the
  note. From Phil. iii. 18, 19.</p>

  <p>822. See Pard. Tale, C. 549, 558.</p>

  <p>828. The mention of St. Gregory is copied from the Fr. text; see
  Ayenb. p. 51, l. 18. The passage meant is the following: 'Sciendum
  praeterea est quia quinque nos modis gulae uitium tentat. Aliquando
  namque indigentiae tempora praeuenit; aliquando uero tempus non
  praeuenit, sed cibos lautiores quaerit; aliquando quaelibet qua <!-- Page
  470 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page470"></a>[470]</span>sumenda
  sint praeparari accuratius expetit; aliquando autem et qualitati ciborum
  et tempori congruit, sed in ipsa quantitate sumendi mensuram moderatae
  refectionis excedit.'&mdash;S. Gregorii Moralium Lib. xxx. cap. xviii. §
  60; ed. Migne, vol. 76, col. 556.</p>

  <p>829. <i>curiositee</i>; Fr. 'curieusete'; Ayenb. 'bysihede,' p. 55, l.
  8 from bottom.</p>

  <p>831. The remedy against Gluttony, in the Fr. text, is 'La vertu de
  Sobrete,' answering to 'the uirtue of Temperance' in the Ayenb. p. 245.
  The Fr. text treats this at great length; but Chaucer only says a few
  words. He mentions, however, 'Attemperaunce' and 'Mesure'; cf. Fr.
  'atemprance' and 'mesure.'</p>

<p class="ac"><b>De Luxuria.</b></p>

  <p>836. This section contains a considerable amount of the matter found
  in the Fr. text, but the comparison between the texts is difficult, owing
  to the frequent changes in the arrangement of the material. Dr. Eilers
  says (p. 566):&mdash;'This chapter of the Eng. text, though twice as
  comprehensive as the French, contains more in quantity that corresponds
  with the Fr. than that diverges from it, and exceeds all the previous
  chapters in the degree of correspondence.' For details, see Dr. Eilers'
  essay, and cf. Ayenb. pp. 46-49.</p>

  <p>After 'departe,' MS. Hl. supplies a reference to Eph. v. 18.</p>

  <p>837-8. See Exod. xx. 14; Lev. xix. 20; Deut. xxii. 21; Lev. xxi.
  9.</p>

  <p>839. <i>thonder-leyt</i>, thunder-bolt, lit. thunder-flash; A. S.
  <i>l&#x12B;get</i>, <i>l&#x12B;getu</i>, a flash; cf. note to Boethius,
  bk. i. met. 4. 8. See Gen. xix. 24.</p>

  <p>841. <i>stank</i>, pool; 'stagno' in the Vulgate (Rev. xxi. 8).</p>

  <p>842-5. See Matt. xix. 5; Eph. v. 25; Exod. xx. 17; Matt. v. 28.</p>

  <p>852. <i>that other</i>, the second. The former is mentioned above, in
  830. The 'five fingers' are, in Fr., called <i>fol regart</i>, <i>fous
  atouchemenz</i>, <i>foles paroles</i>, <i>fous baisiers</i>, <i>le
  fait</i>; all 'si come dist saint Gregoire.' Cf. Ayenb. p. 46.</p>

  <p>853. <i>basilicok</i>, basilisk; Fr. Text, 'basilicoc.' The fabulous
  basilisk, or cockatrice, which had a head like a cock and a body like a
  serpent, was supposed to slay men by its mere glance. In the Wars of
  Alexander, ed. Skeat, 4837-57, we read how Alexander induced a basilisk
  to commit suicide by gazing in a mirror. Cf. Ayenb. p. 28, l. 12.</p>

  <p>854. See Prov. vi. 26-9; vii. 26; Ecclus. xii. 13, 14; xiii. 1; xxvi.
  7.</p>

  <p>858. <i>roser</i>, rose-bush; as in Havelok, 2919.</p>

  <p><i>busshes</i>, as in Tyrwhitt, must be the right reading; but I can
  find <i>no authority</i> for it. The MSS. all have <i>beautees</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
  beauties, or some equivalent form. Thynne (ed. 1550) has <i>benches</i>,
  which is also found in some MSS.; but it does not help us.</p>

  <p>859. Compare this with the March. Tale, E. 1840; and see Ayenb. p. 48,
  l. 25.</p>

  <p>861. 'Si egeris patienter, coniunx mutabitur in sororem'; Hieron. c.
  Iouinianum, lib. i. (ed. 1524, t. ii. p. 25). <!-- Page 471 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page471"></a>[471]</span></p>

  <p>867. 'St. Paul gives them the kingdom due to sinners.' In fact, St.
  Paul denies them the kingdom due to saints; which comes to the same
  thing. See Gal. v. 19-21; and see 884 below. Cf. Rev. xxi. 8.</p>

  <p>869. <i>the hundred fruit</i>, i.&nbsp;e. fruit brought forth a
  hundred-fold. Cf. 'dabant <i>fructum</i>, aliud <i>centesimum</i>,'
  &amp;c.; Matt. xiii. 8. It was usual to liken virginity, widowhood, and
  matrimony, respectively, to the bringing forth of fruit a hundredfold,
  sixtyfold and thirtyfold; see P. Plowman, C. xix. 84-90, and note to l.
  84; Hali Meidenhad, ed. Cockayne, p. 22; Ayenb. p. 234.
  '<i>Centesimus</i> et sexagesimus et tricesimus <i>fructus</i> ... multum
  differt in numero. Triginta referuntur ad nuptias ... Sexaginta uero ad
  uiduas ... Porro <i>centesimus</i> numerus ... exprimit uirginitatis
  coronam'; Hieronymus contra Iouinianum, lib. i; ed. 1524, ii. 18. The Fr.
  text has: 'Ceus qui gardent virginite ont le centiesme fruit.' But
  Chaucer, being well acquainted with Jerome's treatise, recognised at once
  the Latin source; for in MS. Hl. we find the note, 'secundum Ieronimum
  contra Iouinianum.'</p>

  <p>879. 'Him shall God destroy'; 1 Cor. iii. 17.</p>

  <p>880. <i>douted</i>, feared. See Gen. xxxix. 8, 9.</p>

  <p>884. 'Huanne me brecth the sacrement of spoushod, hit y-ualth
  otherhuyl desertesoun of eyr, and ualse mariages'; Ayenb. p. 48.</p>

  <p>887. <i>gladly</i>, readily; hence, fittingly.</p>

  <p>889. 'Iam amplius noli peccare'; John viii. 11.</p>

  <p>895. <i>as by the dignitee</i>, i.&nbsp;e. on account of the dignity of
  their office; see note to 900.</p>

  <p>'Satanas transfigurat se,' &amp;c.; 2 Cor. xi. 14.</p>

  <p>897-8. From 1 Sam. ii. 12 (in the Vulgate, <i>Liber primus Regum</i>).
  <i>Belial</i> signifies worthlessness; and hence, lawlessness, or evil.
  But in the Vulgate version of Judges, xix. 22, the word <i>Belial</i> is
  explained to mean 'absque iugo'; which in O. French would become 'sans
  ioug.' Chaucer seems to have met with this explanation, and perhaps
  misread it as 'sans iuge'; i.&nbsp;e. 'without Iuge.'</p>

  <p>900. <i>misterie</i>, i.&nbsp;e. office, duty. As in 895 above,
  <i>misterie</i> is here short for <i>ministerie</i>, i.&nbsp;e. ministry,
  office, duty; in fact, the Selden and Lansdowne MSS. actually have the
  spelling <i>mynysterie</i>. MS. Cm., by a singular error, adds
  <i>mynystre</i> again, and has the reading: 'kunne not <i>mynystre</i>
  the mysterie.' Tyrwhitt has wrongly introduced the extra <i>mynystre</i>.
  Wright copied him; Bell copied Wright; and Morris copied Bell; so that
  these editions vary from the Harl. MS., which <i>omits</i> it! The
  question is easily settled. 'The Book' means the Bible; and the Vulgate
  version (1 Sam. ii. 12, 13) has 'nescientes ... <i>officium</i>
  sacerdotum ad populum.' Hence <i>conne</i> means 'know.'</p>

  <p>904. 'Adulter est, inquit [Xystus, in sententiis] in suam uxorem
  amator ardentior,' &amp;c.; S. Hieron. c. Iouinian. lib. i. (near the
  end)</p>

  <p>906. There is no such passage in the E. version of the book of Tobit;
  but it occurs in the Vulgate, Tob. vi. 17; and see Ayenb. p. 223.</p>

  <p>908. <i>godsibbes</i>, i.&nbsp;e. his godmother or his goddaughter.
  Already, in the Laws of Cnut (Eccles. § vii), we find that a man is
  forbidden to <!-- Page 472 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page472"></a>[472]</span>marry his godmother; and this rule was
  formerly stringent. Cf. Ayenb. p. 48.</p>

  <p>915. This section has much in common with the Fr. text. 'We meet,'
  says Dr. Eilers, 'with whole sentences in entire agreement.' See Ayenb.
  pp. 202-238.</p>

  <p>916. <i>two maneres</i>, two ways; cf. the two 'states,' in Ayenb. p.
  220.</p>

  <p>918-19. Eph. v. 32; Gen. ii. 24; John ii. 1.</p>

  <p>922. Eph. v. 25, again quoted in 929; 1 Cor. xi. 3.</p>

  <p>927. <i>desray</i>, disorder, 'dissarray'; A. F. <i>desrei</i>, O. F.
  <i>desroi</i>; see <i>derai</i> in Stratmann.</p>

  <p>930. MS. Hl. adds <i>cap. iij.</i> after <i>Peter</i>; hence the
  reference is to 1 Pet. iii. 1.</p>

  <p>933. Perhaps the reference is to Rev. xvii. 4, xviii. 16.</p>

  <p>934. <i>Gregorie</i>; see note to 414 above, p. 458.</p>

  <p>939. <i>three thinges</i>, three reasons; so in Ayenb. p. 222, l.
  14.</p>

  <p>944. <i>widewe</i>; cf. Ayenb. p. 225, l. 9.</p>

  <p>947. <i>boyste</i>, box; Mat. xxvi. 7; John xii. 3.</p>

  <p>948. <i>lyf</i>, life; i.&nbsp;e. she lives like them; Fr. semblant as
  angels du ciel,' i.&nbsp;e. like the angels of heaven. Cf. P. Plowman, C. xix.
  89-100; Ayenb. p. 227, l. 13.</p>

  <p>951. See the parallel passage; Ayenb. p. 204, at the bottom.</p>

  <p>954. <i>leyt</i>, flame; the candle being stuck close to the wall.</p>

  <p>955. <i>Daniel</i>; so in E. Cm.; but the other five MSS. have
  <i>Dauid</i>, i.&nbsp;e. David. It appears that <i>David</i> is the correct
  reading, since the names of Sampson, David, and Solomon occur both in the
  Fr. text, and in Ayenb. p. 204.</p>

  <p>956-7. Probably Chaucer omitted the ten commandments, because he was
  getting tired of the work. He mentions them because they are treated of
  at length in the French treatise; see Ayenb. pp. 5-11. Hence his 'leaving
  them to divines' is a mere excuse. Cf. Kn. Tale, A. 1323; and see note to
  1043 below (p. 474).</p>

  <p>We may also see, in this expression, a clear proof that this Treatise
  was <i>originally</i> made by Chaucer in his own person. On assigning
  this Tale to the Parson, he should have struck out this tell-tale clause;
  for surely the Parson was 'a divine.'</p>

  <p><b>De Confessione.</b> Instead of this Title, most MSS., including E.,
  have&mdash;'Sequitur secunda Pars Penitencie.' But this is unsuitable, as
  it has already appeared, viz. at p. 586. I have therefore taken, from
  MSS. Pt. and Christchurch, the alternative title&mdash;'De Confessione.'
  See p. 639.</p>

  <p>958. This chapter, on Confession, answers to a similar chapter in the
  Fr. text, though the material has been re-arranged. See Ayenb. pp.
  172-180; Ancren Riwle, pp. 299, 317. The reference to the 'firste
  chaptire' is to paragraph 107, on p. 572.</p>

  <p>959. <i>fyve wittes</i>, five senses, also called 'the vif wittes of
  the bodie' in Ayenb. p. 177. And cf. P. Plowman, C. ii. 15, and the
  note.</p>

  <p>960. <i>that that</i>, that which, what it is that. <!-- Page 473

  <p>961. This corresponds to Ayenb. p. 175, l. 23, and lines following, to
  p. 176, l. 12; but the order varies.</p>

  <p>971. <i>eschew</i>, reluctant; lit. 'shy.' See E. 1812, and the note.
  Tyrwhitt reads <i>slow</i>, which is ingenious, but wrong.</p>

  <p>979. <i>engreggen</i>, aggravate; Fr. 'les circumstances qui poent
  <i>engreger</i> le pecche.' Godefroy, s.&nbsp;v. <i>engregier</i>, quotes this
  very passage, from two other MS. which read, respectively, 'qui pueent
  <i>engregier</i> le pechie,' and 'qui <i>engrigent</i> les pechies.'</p>

  <p>981. <i>namely by the two</i>, especially by the (former) two;
  penitence and shrift. <i>the thridde</i>, the third; i.&nbsp;e. satisfaction,
  reparation.</p>

  <p>982. <i>foure</i>, four; Fr. 'six.' See Ayenb. p. 172, l. 6.</p>

  <p>983. <i>Ezekias</i>, Hezekiah; Fr. text, 'Ezechias'; all the MSS. have
  <i>Ezekiel</i> (wrongly); see Isaiah, xxxviii. 15. The Ayenb. has
  'ezechie'; p. 172, l. 9 from bottom.</p>

  <p>986-8. See Luke xviii. 13; 1 Pet. v. 6.</p>

  <p>994, 996. See Matt. xxvi. 75; Luke vii. 37.</p>

  <p>998. <i>hastily</i>, without delay; Ayenb. 'hasteliche,' p. 173, l.
  10; Fr. 'hastivement.' And see Ayenb. p. 173, l. 25 for the rest of the
  sentence.</p>

  <p>1005. <i>countrewaite</i>, watch against, be on his guard against; see
  Tale of Melibeus, B. 2508.</p>

  <p>1006. <i>parcel</i>, part; <i>departe</i>, divide; see Ayenb. p.
  175.</p>

  <p>1008. Cf. Somn. Tale, D. 2095-8.</p>

  <p>1013. <i>nayte</i>, deny; Icel. <i>neita</i>; Tyrwhitt has <i>nay</i>.
  So, in Boeth. bk. i. met. 1. l. 16, where the original has <i>negat</i>,
  MS. Addit. has <i>naieth</i>; but the Camb. MS. has <i>nayteth</i>.</p>

  <p>1020. This passage from St. Augustine is alluded to in the Ancren
  Riwle, p. 337:&mdash;'Qui causa humilitatis mentitur fit quod prius ipse
  non fuit, id est, peccator.' See S. August. Sermo clxxxi. § 4 (ed. Migne,
  vol. 38, col. 981): 'Propter humilitatem dicis te peccatorem.... Testis
  ergo falsus es contra te.'</p>

  <p>1025. Cf. Ayenb. p. 178, l. 13; Ancren Riwle, p. 323.</p>

  <p>1027. <i>ones a yere</i>, viz. at Easter. In the Ancren Riwle, p. 413,
  fifteen times are mentioned. See P. Plowman, C. xxi. 472, xxii. 3, and
  the note to the latter passage. <i>renovellen</i>, are renewed; i.&nbsp;e. in
  spring-time.</p>

<p class="ac"><b>De Satisfaccione.</b></p>

  <p>1030. In Religious Pieces, ed. Perry (E. E. T. S.), p. 9, the seven
  'works of mercy' are (1) feeding the hungry; (2) giving drink to the
  thirsty; (3) clothing the naked; (4) sheltering the homeless; (5)
  visiting the sick; (6) visiting prisoners; (7) burying the dead poor.</p>

  <p>1031. Cf. P. Plowman, C. ii. 20 (B. i. 20), and the note.</p>

  <p>1034. Compare Ayenb. p. 192, l. 5.</p>

  <p>1036. From Matt. v. 14-16. Chaucer's translation is smoother than
  Wyclif's. <!-- Page 474 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page474"></a>[474]</span></p>

  <p>1040-2. Compare Ayenbite, p. 99.</p>

  <p>1043. Here again Chaucer really speaks in his own person; cf. note to
  957 above. The reason for his mentioning the 'exposition' of the prayer
  is, that a long exposition, which he wished to avoid, is given in the Fr.
  text (see Ayenb. pp. 99-118).</p>

  <p>1045. Epitomised from the Fr. text; see Ayenb. p. 207.</p>

  <p>1048. <i>wakinge</i>, watching; see Matt. xxvi. 41.</p>

  <p>1049. Cf. Ayenb. p. 53, where <i>iolyuete</i> answers to
  <i>ioliuete</i> in the Fr. text, and to <i>Iolitee</i> in Chaucer.</p>

  <p>1051. On eating, see P. Plowman, C. ix. 273 (B. vi. 263). <i>in
  untyme</i>, at a wrong season; see P. Plowm. B. ix. 186.</p>

  <p>1052. Observe that, in 1038, Chaucer says that <i>bodily pain</i>
  stands in (1) prayers; (2) watching; (3) fasting; and (4) virtuous
  teachings. He speaks of <i>prayers</i> in 1039-1047; of <i>watching</i>
  in 1048-9; of <i>fasting</i> in 1050-1. He now takes up 'teaching,' by
  which he means, in the first place, <i>bodily</i> 'discipline'; and the
  words 'or techinge by word or by writinge or in ensample' are,
  practically, parenthetical. The word <i>discipline</i> is due to the Fr.
  text; cf. Ayenb. p. 250, l. 2: 'ase ine <i>uestinges</i>, ine
  <i>wakiinges</i>, ine <i>dissiplines</i>,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>heyres</i>, hair-shirts; see P. Plowman, C. vii. 6, and the
  note.</p>

  <p><i>haubergeons</i>, habergeons, shirts of mail. It is surprising to
  find, in the Romance of Tristan, ed. Michel, ii. 36, that the heroine
  (Yseult) is described as wearing a 'byrnie' or shirt of mail next her
  skin:&mdash;'Vest une brunie à sa char nue.' Michel quotes from Le Voyage
  de Charlemagne à Constantinople, I. 635:&mdash;'Il lur a cumaundet que
  aient vestu brunies.'</p>

  <p>1054. Tyrwhitt puts a comma after <i>herte</i>, and none after
  <i>God</i>, and other editors follow him. But the text (Col. iii. 12)
  has: 'Induite uos ergo, sicut electi Dei, ... uiscera misericordiae,
  benignitatem, ... patientiam.' Hence 'in herte of misericorde' simply
  translates 'uiscera misericordiae.'</p>

  <p>1055-6. <i>Not</i> in the Fr. text. Cf. P. Plowm. C. viii. 61, and the
  note.</p>

  <p>1057. The Fr. text mentions <i>five</i> things; the fifth is a wicked
  love of sin; see Ayenb. p. 179.</p>

  <p>1059. Fr. 'au regart de la peine d'enfer.'</p>

  <p>1067. <i>surquidrie</i>, too great confidence; see 403 above, and the
  note.</p>

  <p>1069. From S. Gregorii Moralium lib. xxxiv. cap. xix. § 36 (ed. Migne,
  vol. 76, col. 738):&mdash;'Ad districti ergo iudicis iustitiam pertinet,
  ut nunquam careant supplicio, quorum mens in hac uita nunquam uoluit
  carere peccato.'</p>

  <p>1073. There is here a sad oversight. For 'the <i>seconde</i> wanhope,'
  we should read 'the <i>same</i> wanhope.' The <i>second</i> kind of
  despair is discussed in 1074. All the MSS. have this mistake.</p>

  <p>1080. <i>poverte espirituel</i>; this refers to the 'poor in spirit';
  Matt. v. 3. <i>lowenesse</i>, i.&nbsp;e. meekness; Matt. v. 5. <i>hunger</i>;
  Matt. v. 6. <i>travaille</i>; Matt. v. 4, 10, 11. <i>lyf</i>; Rom. viii.
  13. This concluding passage may be compared with the concluding passage
  of the Ayenbite, p. 261. <!-- Page 475 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page475"></a>[475]</span></p>

  <p>1081. This final paragraph is variously headed in the MSS. E. has:
  'Here taketh the makere of this book his leue.' So also Cm. So also Pt.,
  preceded by 'Explicit fabula Rectoris.' Hl. has: 'Preces de Chauceres.'
  The words 'this litel tretis' refer, of course, to the Persones Tale
  <i>as originally written</i>, so that some part of this concluding
  address was certainly added afterwards. The interpolation (due to Chaucer
  himself, if we may trust the evidence) probably extends (as Tyrwhitt
  suggested) from the words <i>and namely</i> in 1085 to the words
  <i>salvacioun of my soule</i> in 1090. This accounts for the unusual
  length of the sentence in 1084-1092. The addition was made at the time of
  revision, when Chaucer had made up his mind that the Persones Tale was to
  be the last; and he took the opportunity of writing the <i>conclusion</i>
  of the work before it was, in reality, completed. This accounts for the
  whole matter.</p>

  <p>1083. Alluding to Rom. xv. 4.</p>

  <p>1085. <i>I revoke in my retracciouns</i>, I recall by retracting what
  I may have said amiss. There is no need to lay an undue stress on this
  expression, as if the author had been compelled to denounce and retract
  most of his works. We may fairly understand the expression 'thilke that
  sownen into sinne' as applicable to <i>all</i> the works, and not to the
  Tales alone. Whilst thanking God for his devotional works, it was not out
  of place for him to 'recall' his more secular ones; for this expression
  seems to mean no more than that he could not claim that they were written
  in God's service. To 'revoke' cannot here mean 'to withdraw,' because the
  poems named were <i>not</i> withdrawn, nor was there any way in which
  such a result could have been brought about. Cf. vol. iii. p. 503.</p>

  <p>1086. <i>The book of the xix. Ladies</i> is, of course, the Legend of
  Good Women. For <i>xix.</i>, most MSS. have 'xxv.'; MS. Harl. 1758 has
  '25'; MS. Ln. has 'xv.'; and MS. Hl. has '29'; but we know, from the Poem
  itself, that 'xix.' is correct. Numbers, as the various readings shew,
  easily went wrong; see note to 565 above.</p>

  <p>'The book of seint Valentynes day of the Parlement of Briddes' is all
  one title; the poem itself is well known.</p>

  <p>1087. 'The book of the Lion' is now lost; most likely, as Tyrwhitt
  suggests, it was a translation from, or adaptation of, Le Dit du Lione, a
  poem by G. de Machault, composed in the year 1342. It is printed among
  Machault's poems. Lydgate, in his Prologue to the Falls of Princes,
  ascribes this work to Chaucer in the words:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And of the Lyon a boke he did wryte.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But it is probable that Lydgate is merely quoting from the present
  passage, and knew no more of the matter than we do.</p>

  <p>I may here note that Tyrwhitt expresses his astonishment that Chaucer
  does not expressly 'revoke' his translation of the Romaunt of the Rose;
  but it is sufficiently indicated by the words 'and namely [i.&nbsp;e.
  <i>especially</i>] of my <i>translacions</i>'; see 1085. <!-- Page 476
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page476"></a>[476]</span></p>

  <p>1088. <i>Boece</i>, i.&nbsp;e. his translation of Boethius.
  <i>Legendes</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the Legend of St. Cecilia and the Legend of the
  boy-saint in the Prioresses Tale. <i>Omelies</i>, homilies; such as the
  Parson's Tale and the Tale of Melibeus. <i>moralitee and devocioun</i>;
  such as Chaucer's A B C, and his Balades on Fortune, Truth, Gentilesse,
  and Lack of Steadfastness; also the Monkes Tale, which is expressly
  called 'a Tragedie.' The Pardoneres Tale, moreover, is called 'an honest
  thing'; and even of the Nonnes Prestes Tale we are bidden, at the end, to
  'take the moralitee.'</p>

<p class="ac">TO</p>

<p class="ac lg125">THE TALE OF GAMELYN.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Litheth</i>, hearken ye; cf. l. 169. This is the imperative
  plural; so also <i>lesteneth</i>, <i>herkeneth</i>. See remarks on the
  dialect in vol. iii. p. 400. For the explanation of the harder words, see
  the Glossary. Compare: 'Now list and <i>lithe</i>, you gentlemen'; Percy
  Folio MS., ii. 218; 'Now <i>lithe</i> and listen, gentlemen,' id. iii.
  77.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Iohan of Boundys.</i> It is not clear what is meant by
  <i>Boundys</i>, which is repeated in l. 226; nor is there any clear
  indication of the supposed locality of the story. Lodge, in his novel
  (see vol. iii. p. 404), ingeniously substitutes <i>Bourdeaux</i>, and
  calls the knight 'Sir John of Bourdeaux.'<a name="NtA_29"
  href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> In Shakespeare, he becomes Sir Roland
  de Bois.</p>

  <p>The reading <i>righte</i> (for <i>right</i>) is demanded by grammar,
  the article being in the definite form; and the same reading is equally
  demanded by the metre. Where the final <i>e</i> is thus necessary to the
  grammar and metre alike, there is little difficulty in restoring the
  correct reading. Compare <i>the good-e knight</i> in ll. 11, 25, 33.</p>

  <p>4. 'He was sufficiently instructed by right bringing up, and knew much
  about sport.' <i>Nurture</i> is the old phrase for a 'genteel education.'
  Thus we find 'The boke of <i>Nurture</i>, or Schoole of good maners: for
  men, seruants, and children,' written by Hugh Rhodes, and printed in
  1577; and John Russell's 'Boke of Nurture,' in MS. Harl. 4011. See the
  Babees Book, ed. F. J. Furnivall, 1868; where much information as to the
  behaviour of our forefathers is given. By <i>game</i> is meant what is
  now called <i>sport</i>; 'The Master of the Game' is the name of an old
  treatise on hunting; see Reliquiae Antiquae, i. 149. Cf. As You Like It,
  ii. 7. 97: 'Yet am I inland bred, And know some nurture.'</p>

  <p>5. <i>Thre sones</i>, three sons. They are here named Johan, Ote, and
  Gamelyn; Lodge calls them Saladyne, Fernandine, and Rosader; in
  Shakespeare, they are Oliver, Jaques, and Orlando. The characters of the
  three are much the same in all three versions of the story.</p>

  <p>6. <i>sone he began</i>, he soon began, viz. to evince his
  disposition. <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page478"></a>[478]</span></p>

  <p>12. <i>his day</i>, his term of life, his lifetime. So in Hamlet, v.
  1. 315, the 'dog will have his <i>day</i>.' Hence <i>after his day</i>
  is, practically, after his death.</p>

  <p>14. 'This appears to mean, that the knight had himself acquired his
  land, and held it in fee simple (<i>verrey purchas</i>), not entailed nor
  settled; and that, consequently, he had a right to divide it among his
  children as he pleased. The <i>housbond</i> in this case means a man who
  was kept at home looking after his domestic business and his estates, and
  who could not be <i>wyde-wher</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. often far from home; note by
  Mr. Jephson. See ll. 58-61 below, which prove that the knight had partly
  inherited his land, and partly won it by military service. Cf. Chaucer,
  Prol. 256, 319. In the Freres Tale (D. 1449) we find:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And here I ryde about my <i>purchasing</i>,</p>
      <p>To wite wher men wolde yeve me any-thing;</p>
      <p>My <i>purchas</i> is theffect of al my rente.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I cannot think that Dr. Morris is right in explaining
  <i>purchasing</i> by 'prosecution'; see <i>Purchas</i> in the
  Glossary.</p>

  <p>16. <i>hadde</i>, might have; the subjunctive mood.</p>

  <p>20. <i>on lyve</i>, in life; now written <i>a-live</i> or
  <i>alive</i>. <i>Lyve</i> is the dat. case, governed by <i>on</i>, which
  constantly has the sense of 'in' in A.S. and M.E.</p>

  <p>23. <i>ther</i>, where. The reader should note this common idiom, or
  he will miss the structure of the sentence. Cf. ll. 33, 52, 66,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>31. <i>ne dismay you nought</i>, do not dismay yourself; i.&nbsp;e. be not
  dismayed or dispirited.</p>

  <p>32. 'God can bring good out of the evil that is now wrought.'
  <i>Boot</i>, advantage, remedy, or profit, is continually contrasted with
  <i>bale</i> or evil; the alliteration of the words rendered them suitable
  for proverbial phrases. One of the commonest is 'When <i>bale</i> is
  hext, then <i>boot</i> is next,' i.&nbsp;e. when evil is highest (at its
  height), then the remedy is nighest. This is one of the Proverbs of
  Hendyng; see Specimens of English, ed. Morris and Skeat, part ii. p. 40.
  So, in l. 34, <i>Boote of bale</i> means 'remedy of evil,' good out of
  evil. See note to l. 631.</p>

  <p>34. <i>it is no nay</i>, there is no denying it, it cannot be denied.
  So in Chaucer, C. T. 8693, 9015 (E. 817, 1139).</p>

  <p>39. <i>that on, that other</i>, the one, the other. Sometimes
  corruptly written <i>the ton, the tother</i>; and hence the vulgar
  English <i>the tother</i>.</p>

  <p>43. Such was their intention, but it was partly overruled; for we see,
  from l. 45, that the second son duly received his share.</p>

  <p>48. <i>whan he good cowde</i>, when he knew what was good, i.&nbsp;e. when
  he was old enough to know right from wrong; or, as we now say, when he
  came to years of discretion. Observe that the division of land here
  proposed was not final; for the good knight, being still alive, altered
  it; see l. 54.</p>

  <p>53. 'Saint Martin was a Hungarian by birth, and served in the army
  under Constantius and Julian. He is represented in pictures as <!-- Page
  479 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page479"></a>[479]</span>a Roman
  knight on horseback, with his sword dividing his cloak into two pieces,
  one of which he gives to a beggar. He was a strenuous opponent of the
  Arians, and died at Tours, where his relics were preserved and
  honoured.'&mdash;Jephson. St. Martin's day, commonly called Martinmas, is
  Nov. 11. The knight swears by St. Martin in his character of soldier. Cf.
  l. 225.</p>

  <p>57. <i>plowes</i>, ploughlands; see the Glossary.</p>

  <p>62. The knight's intention was, evidently, that Gamelyn's share should
  be the best. In Lodge's novel, Sir John gives to the eldest 'fourteen
  ploughlands, with all my manner-houses and my richest plate'; to the
  second, 'twelve ploughlands'; but to the youngest, says he, 'I give my
  horse, my armour, and my launce, with sixteene ploughlands; for, if the
  inwarde thoughts be discovered by outward shadows, Rosader wil exceed you
  all in bountie and honour.'</p>

  <p>64. 'That my bequest may stand,' i.&nbsp;e. remain good.</p>

  <p>67. <i>stoon-stille</i>, as still as a stone. So Chaucer has 'as
  stille as stoon'; Clerkes Tale, E. 121. See ll. 263, 423.</p>

  <p>76. 'And afterwards he paid for it in his fair skin.' We should now
  say, his recompense fell upon his own head.</p>

  <p>78. <i>of good wil</i>, readily, of their own accord. 'They of their
  own accord feared him as being the strongest.' So also 'of thine own good
  will,' Shak. Rich. II. iv. 1. 177; 'by her good will,' Venus and Adonis,
  479. But the nearest parallel passage is in Octouian Imperator, l. 561,
  pr. in Weber's Metrical Romances, iii. 180. It is there said of some
  sailors who were chased by a lioness, that they ran away very hastily
  'with good wylle.' Cf. <i>in wille</i>, i.&nbsp;e. anxious, in l. 173.</p>

  <p>82. To handle his beard, i.&nbsp;e. to feel, by his beard, that he was of
  full age. Lodge has a parallel passage, but gives a more literal sense to
  the expression 'hondlen his berd,' which merely signifies that he was
  growing up. 'With that, casting up his hand, he felt haire on his face,
  and perceiving his beard to bud, for choler he began to blush, and swore
  to himselfe he would be no more subject to such slaverie.' Cf. As You
  Like It, iii. 2. 218, 396.</p>

  <p>90. 'Is our meat prepared,' i.&nbsp;e. is our dinner ready? <i>Our</i>
  perhaps means <i>my</i>, being used in a lordly style. See the next
  note.</p>

  <p>92. Observe the use of the familiar <i>thou</i>, in place of the usual
  respectful <i>ye</i>. This accounts for the elder brother's astonishment,
  as expressed in the next line.</p>

  <p>100. 'Brother by name, and brother in that only.'</p>

  <p>101. <i>that rape was of rees</i>, who was hasty in his fit of
  passion. Mr. Jephson's explanation 'deprived of reason for anger' is
  incorrect. <i>Rape</i> is hasty; see the Glossary. <i>Rees</i> is the
  modern E. <i>race</i>, A.&nbsp;S. <i>r&#x1E3;s</i>, applied to any sudden
  course, whether bodily or mental; cf. l. 547. So in Gower, ed. Pauli, i.
  335, we find:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Do thou no-thinge in suche a <i>rees</i>,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>i.&nbsp;e. do nothing in such a sudden fit; referring to Pyramus, who
  rashly slew himself upon the hasty false assumption that Thisbe was dead.
  <!-- Page 480 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page480"></a>[480]</span></p>

  <p>102. <i>gadeling</i>, fellow; a term of reproach. But observe that the
  sarcasm lies in the similarity of the sound of the word to
  <i>Gamelyn</i>. Hence Gamelyn's indignant reply. In P. Plowman, C. xi.
  297, <i>gadelynges</i> are ranked with false folk, deceivers, and
  liars.</p>

  <p>103. 'Thou shall be glad to get mere food and clothing.'</p>

  <p>109. <i>ner</i>, nigher, the old <i>comparative</i> form; afterwards
  written <i>near</i>, and wrongly extended to <i>near-er</i>, with a
  <i>double</i> comparative suffix. Cf. l. 135, 352.</p>

  <p><i>a-foote</i>, on foot; not <i>a foot</i>, the length of a foot, as
  that would have no final <i>e</i>.</p>

  <p>115. <i>schal algate</i>, must in any case.</p>

  <p>116. This is obscure; it may mean 'unless <i>thou</i> art the one (to
  do it)'; i.&nbsp;e. to give me the beating. In other words, Gamelyn dares his
  brother to use the rod himself, not to delegate such an office to
  another. But his brother was much too wary to take such advice; he
  preferred to depute the business to his men.</p>

  <p>121. <i>over-al</i>, all about, all round, everywhere.</p>

  <p>122. <i>stood</i>, i.&nbsp;e. which stood. The omission of the relative is
  common.</p>

  <p>125. <i>good woon</i>, good store; plentifully.</p>

  <p>129. <i>for his eye</i>, for awe of him. <i>His</i> is not the
  possessive pronoun here, but the genitive of the personal pronoun.</p>

  <p>130. <i>by halves</i>, lit. by sides; i.&nbsp;e. some to one side, some to
  the other. <i>drowe by halves</i> = sidled away.</p>

  <p>131. 'May ye prosper ill!' Cf. Chaucer, Pard. Tale, C. 947.</p>

  <p>136. 'I will teach thee some play with the buckler.' An allusion to
  the 'sword and buckler play,' described in Strutt, Sports and Pastimes,
  bk. iii. ch. 6. § 22. Not unlike our modern 'single-stick,' but with the
  addition of a buckler in the left hand. Strutt gives a picture from a
  Bodleian MS., dated 1344, in which clubs or bludgeons are substituted for
  swords; and, no doubt, the swords used in sport were commonly of wood.
  Gamelyn is speaking jocosely; he had no buckler, but he had a wooden
  'pestel,' which did very well for a sword.</p>

  <p>137. '<i>by Saint Richard</i> was a favourite oath<a name="NtA_30"
  href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> with the outlaws of Robin Hood's stamp,
  probably because of his Saxon extraction'; Jephson. Mr. Jephson adds the
  following quotation from the English Martyrologe, 1608: 'Saint Richard,
  King and Confessor, was sonne to Lotharius, King of Kent, who, for the
  love of Christ, taking upon him a long peregrination, went to Rome for
  devotion to that sea [<i>see</i>], and, on his way homeward, died at
  Lucca, about the year of Christ 750, where his body is kept until this
  day, with great veneration, in the oratory and chappell of St. Frigidian,
  and adorned with an epitaph both in verse and prose.' But this is
  altogether beside the mark; for Mr. Jephson certainly refers to the wrong
  saint. There were four St. Richards, commemorated, respectively, on Feb.
  7, April 3, June 9, and August 21; see Alban Butler's Lives of the
  Saints. The day of <!-- Page 481 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page481"></a>[481]</span>the Saxon king is Feb. 7; but he could
  hardly have been so fresh in the memory of Englishmen as the more noted
  St. Richard, bishop of Chichester, who died in 1253, and was canonized in
  1262; his day being April 3. There is a special fitness in the allusion
  to this latter saint, because he was a pattern of <i>brotherly love</i>,
  and Johan is here deprecating Gamelyn's anger. Alban Butler says of him:
  'The unfortunate situation of his eldest brother's affairs gave him an
  occasion of exercising his benevolent disposition. Richard condescended
  to become his <i>brother's servant</i>, undertook the management of his
  farms, and by his industry and generosity effectually retrieved his
  brother's before distressed circumstances.' His name still appears in our
  Prayer-books.</p>

  <p>141. <i>I mot nede</i> is used for 'I must needs'; see examples in
  Mätzner, Alteng. Sprachproben, i. 302 (182). <i>Mot</i> is the present
  tense; whereas <i>moste</i> (mod. E. <i>must</i>) is the past tense, and
  was once grammatically incorrect as a form of the present tense.</p>

  <p>150. <i>of thing</i>, of a thing; as in Sir Tristram, 406.</p>

  <p>154. 'And mind that thou blame me, unless I soon grant it.'</p>

  <p>156. 'If we are to be at one,' i.&nbsp;e. to be reconciled. Cf. l. 166.</p>

  <p>158. 'Thou must cause me to possess it, if we are not to quarrel.'</p>

  <p>160. We should now say&mdash;'All that your father left you, and more
  too, if you would like to have it.' The offer is meant to be very
  liberal.</p>

  <p>164. 'As he well knew (how to do).'</p>

  <p>167. 'In no respect he knew with what sort of a false treason his
  brother kissed him.' <i>Whiche</i> is cognate with the Latin
  <i>qualis</i>, and has here the same sense.</p>

  <p>171. 'There was a wrestling-match proclaimed there, hard by.'</p>

  <p>172. 'And, as prizes for it, there were exhibited a ram and a ring.'
  In Lodge's novel, 'a day of wrastling and tournament' is appointed by
  Torimond, king of France. In Chaucer's Prologue, A. 548, we find: 'At
  wrastling he wolde have alwey the ram.' On this Tyrwhitt has the
  following note: 'This was the usual prize at wrestling-matches. See C. T.
  l. 13671 [Sir Thopas, st. 5], and Gamelyn, ll. 184, 280. Mathew Paris
  mentions a wrestling-match at Westminster, <span class="sm">A. D.</span>
  1222, at which a ram was the prize.' In Strutt's Sports and Pastimes, bk.
  ii. ch. 2. § 14, two men are represented as wrestling for a live cock.
  Strutt also quotes a passage from 'A mery Geste of Robin Hode,' which
  gives an account of a wrestling, at which the following prizes were 'set
  up' (the same phrase being used as here), viz. a white bull, a courser
  with saddle and bridle, a pair of gloves, a <i>red gold ring</i>, and a
  pipe of wine!</p>

  <p>199. 'Why dost thou thus behave?' i.&nbsp;e. make this lamentation. Cf. As
  You Like It, i. 2. 133-140.</p>

  <p>204. 'Unless God be surety for them,' i.&nbsp;e. ensure their recovery. The
  story supposes that the two sons are not slain, but greatly disabled; as
  Shakespeare says, 'there is little hope of life' in them.</p>

  <p>206. <i>with the nones</i>, on the occasion that, provided that.
  <i>For the</i> <!-- Page 482 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page482"></a>[482]</span><i>nones</i>, for the occasion, stands for
  <i>for then ones</i>, for the once; so here <i>with the nones</i> =
  <i>with then ones</i>, with the once. <i>Then</i> is the dat. case of the
  article, being a weakened form of A.S. <i>ð&#x101;m</i>. Cf. l. 456.</p>

  <p>207. <i>wilt thow wel doon</i>, if thou wishest to do a kind deed.</p>

  <p>214. <i>drede not of</i>, fear not for.</p>

  <p>217. 'How he dared adventure himself, to prove his strength upon him
  that was so doughty a champion.'</p>

  <p>224. <i>whyl he couthe go</i>, whilst he was able to go about.</p>

  <p>230. <i>a moche schrewe thou were</i>, thou wast a great doer of
  mischief. Gamelyn retorts that he is now <i>a more</i>, i.&nbsp;e. a still
  greater doer of mischief. <i>Moche</i> is often used of size. In Havelok,
  l. 982, <i>more than the meste</i> = bigger than the biggest.</p>

  <p>236. <i>gonne goon</i>, did go. <i>Gonne</i> is a mere auxiliary
  verb.</p>

  <p>237. 'The champion tried various sleights upon Gamelyn, who was
  prepared for them.'</p>

  <p>240. <i>faste aboute</i>, busily employed, trying your best. Cf. l.
  785.</p>

  <p>248. Spoken ironically, 'shall it be counted as a throw, or as
  none?'</p>

  <p>249. <i>whether</i>, &amp;c., whichever it be accounted.</p>

  <p>253. <i>of him</i>, &amp;c., he stood in no awe of him. Instead of our
  modern expression 'he stood in awe of him,' the M.E. expression is,
  usually, 'he stood awe of him,' suppressing <i>in</i>. It probably arose
  out of the very construction here used, viz. 'awe of him stood to him,'
  i.&nbsp;e. arose in him. However that may be, the idiom is common. Thus, in
  Barbour's Bruce, iii. 62:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Quhen that the lord of Lorne saw</p>
      <p>His men stand off him ane sik awe.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Havelok, l. 277:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Al Engelond of him stod awe,</p>
      <p>Al Engelond was of him adrad.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So also, 'he stode of him non eye'; Rob. of Brunne, tr. of Langtoft,
  p. 8, l. 24. So also in Wallace, v. 929, vi. 878.</p>

  <p>255. 'Who was not at all well pleased.'</p>

  <p>256. 'He is an evil master.' The reading <i>oure alther mayster</i>
  (in Cp.) means&mdash;'he is master of us all.'</p>

  <p>257. 'It is full yore ago'; it is very long ago.</p>

  <p>262. <i>wil no-more</i>, desires no more, has had enough.</p>

  <p>270. 'This fair is done.' A proverb, meaning that the things of the
  fair are sold, and there is no more business to be done.</p>

  <p>271. 'As I hope to do well, I have not yet sold up the half of my
  ware'; i.&nbsp;e. I have more to offer. The wrestler, in spite of his pain,
  utters the grim joke that Gamelyn sells his ware too dearly.</p>

  <p>272. <i>halvendel</i> is for A.S. <i>healfne d&#x1E3;l</i> or <i>þone
  healfan d&#x1E3;l</i>, the accusative case. The word <i>of</i> is to be
  understood after it. See Zupitza's Notes to Guy of Warwick, l. 5916.</p>

  <p>273. See note to l. 334.</p>

  <p>276. <i>lakkest</i>, dispraisest, decriest. In P. Plowman, B. v. 130,
  we <!-- Page 483 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page483"></a>[483]</span>find 'to blame mennes ware'; and, only two
  lines below, the equivalent phrase 'to lakke his chaffare.'</p>

  <p>277. 'By Saint James in Galicia.' In Chaucer's Prologue, the Wife of
  Bath had been 'in Galice at Seint Jame.' The shrine of St. James, at
  Compostella in Galicia, was much frequented by pilgrims. See my note to
  Prol. 466, at p. 44 above. It is remarkable that <i>the whole of this
  line</i> is quoted from A Poem on the Times of Edw. II., l. 475; see
  Political Songs, ed. Wright, p. 345. It occurs again below, l. 764.</p>

  <p>278. 'Yet it is too cheap, that which thou hast bought.' The franklin
  tells the defeated wrestler that it is not for him to call Gamelyn's ware
  dear, for he has, in fact, been let off much too cheaply. Our modern
  <i>cheap</i> is short for <i>good cheap</i>, i.&nbsp;e. bought in good market.
  <i>To buy in a good cheap</i> was shortened to <i>to buy good cheap</i>,
  and finally became <i>to buy cheap</i>.</p>

  <p>281. <i>have</i>, have, receive, take.</p>

  <p>285. <i>rowte</i>, company. We are to suppose that a crowd of
  Gamelyn's admirers accompanied him home. In Lodge's novel, the elder
  brother 'sawe wher Rosader returned with the garland on his head, as
  having won the prize, accompanied with a crue of boon companions; greeved
  at this, he stepped in and shut the gate.'</p>

  <p>297. See note to l. 334.</p>

  <p>302. <i>though thou haddest swore</i>, though thou hadst sworn (the
  contrary). This curious phrase occurs also in Chaucer, Kn. Tale, A. 1089,
  where 'althogh we hadde it sworn' is equivalent to 'though we had sworn
  (the contrary).'</p>

  <p>312. 'That desired either to walk or to ride in.' <i>Go</i>, when
  opposed to <i>ride</i>, means to go on foot, to walk.</p>

  <p>318. <i>and ye wil doon after me</i>, if ye will act according to my
  advice; spoken parenthetically.</p>

  <p>321. <i>oure catour</i>, caterer for us. <i>oure aller purs</i>, the
  purse of us all. Cf. footnotes to l. 256.</p>

  <p>324. <i>largely</i>, liberally; the usual old meaning.</p>

  <p>328. <i>no cheste</i>, no strife, no quarrelling.</p>

  <p>334. <i>so</i>, &amp;c., 'as I hope to enjoy the use of my eye'; lit.
  'as I may use my eye.' This phrase occurs also in Havelok, 2545: 'So mote
  ich brouke mi rith eie,' as I hope to have the use of my right eye. And
  again in the same, l. 1743, with the substitution of 'finger or toe' for
  'right eye'; and in l. 311, with the substitution of 'mi blake swire,'
  i.&nbsp;e. my black neck; cf. ll. 273, 297 above. See also ll. 407, 489, 567.
  Even Chaucer has: 'So mote I brouke wel myn eyen tweye,' as I hope to
  make good use of my two eyes; Nonne Prestes Tale, 479 (B. 4490).</p>

  <p>338. <i>bitaughte</i> is used in two senses; they commended Gamelyn to
  God's protection, and bade him good day.</p>

  <p>345. <i>mangerye</i>, feast, lit. an eating. It occurs in P. Plowman,
  C. xiii. 46; Wyclif, Works, ed. Arnold, i. 4. In Sir Amadace, st. 55, a
  wedding-feast is called a <i>maungery</i>, and lasted 40 days; Early Eng.
  Metrical Romances, ed. Robson, p. 49. Cf. ll. 434, 464. <!-- Page 484
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page484"></a>[484]</span></p>

  <p>349, 350. These lines are anticipatory; they give a brief summary of
  the next part of the story.</p>

  <p>352. <i>ful neer</i>, much nearer. See note to l. 109.</p>

  <p>366. <i>Iohan</i> was pronounced like modern E. <i>Jawn</i>, and rimes
  with <i>noon</i>, pronounced as <i>nawn</i> (with <i>aw</i> as in
  <i>awe</i>). So also in Chaucer, Man of Lawes Tale, B. 1019.</p>

  <p>367. 'By my faith'; cf. l. 555. Chaucer has 'by my fey'; Kn. Tale, 268
  (A. 1126).</p>

  <p>368. 'If thou thinkest the same as thou sayst, may God requite it
  thee!'</p>

  <p>372. <i>Tho</i>, when. <i>threwe</i>, didst throw; observe the absence
  of <i><span class="nw">-st</span></i> in the suffix of the second person
  of the past tense of strong verbs.</p>

  <p>373. <i>moot</i>, meeting, assembly, concourse of people; in allusion
  to the crew of companions whom Gamelyn introduced. Moreover, the word
  <i>moot</i> was especially used of an assembly of men in council, like
  our modern <i>meeting</i>. But it is, perhaps, simpler to take it in the
  sense of public disputation, dispute; cf. St. Katherine, l. 1314, and cf.
  M.E. <i>motien</i>, to dispute publicly. Indeed, as the rimes are often
  imperfect, the original word may have been <i>mood</i>, i.&nbsp;e. anger.</p>

  <p>376. It was not uncommon, to prevent a person from being forsworn,
  that the terms of an oath should be literally fulfilled; cf. Merch. Ven.
  iv. l. 326. In his novel, Lodge avoids all improbability by a much
  simpler device. He makes the eldest brother surprise the youngest in his
  sleep. 'On a morning very early he cald up certain of his servants, and
  went with them to the chamber of Rosader, which being open, he entered
  with his crue, and surprized his brother when he was asleepe, and bound
  him with fetters,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>382. Here, as in l. 420, all the MSS. have <i>honde</i>. The final
  <i>e</i> probably represents the dative or <i>instrumental</i> case, and
  the correct reading is <i>fote and honde</i>, as in MSS. Pt. and Ln. in
  both passages.</p>

  <p>386. <i>wood</i>, mad. It was common to bind and starve madmen, and to
  treat them cruelly. Even Malvolio was to be put 'in a dark room and
  bound'; Tw. Nt. iii. 4. 147. Cf. As You Like It, iii. 2. 421.</p>

  <p>392. <i>a party</i> is an adverb, meaning 'partly,' or 'in some
  measure.' Cf. P. Plowman, B. xv. 17; Hampole, Prick of Conscience,
  2334.</p>

  <p>394. <i>or</i>, ere, before; not 'or.' <i>be</i>, been.</p>

  <p>398. '<i>Spence</i>, or (according to the original French form of the
  word) <i>despense</i>, was the closet or room in convents and large
  houses where the victuals, wine, and plate were locked up; and the person
  who had the charge of it was called the <i>spencer</i>, or the
  <i>despencer</i>. Hence originated two common family
  names.'&mdash;Wright. The <i>spence</i>, however, like the
  <i>spencer</i>, owed its name to the O.F. verb <i>despendre</i>, to
  spend; as explained in my Etym. Dict. s.&nbsp;v. <i>spend</i>. See the
  Glossary. Lodge retains the name of Adam Spencer; whence Adam in
  Shakespeare.</p>

  <p>411. 'Upon such an agreement.'</p>

  <p>413. 'All as I may prosper'; as I hope to thrive.</p>

  <p>414. After <i>wil</i> supply <i>lose</i>; see the footnote. 'I will
  hold covenant with thee, if thou wilt loose me.' <!-- Page 485 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page485"></a>[485]</span></p>

  <p>430. <i>wher I go</i>, whether shall I go. <i>Wher</i> is a contracted
  form of <i>whether</i>, like <i>or</i> for <i>other</i>. <i>Girde of</i>,
  strike off.</p>

  <p>433. <i>that this</i>, &amp;c., that this is a thing not to be denied,
  a sure thing.</p>

  <p>438. <i>hem</i>, them, i.&nbsp;e. the fetters (understood); cf. l. 498.</p>

  <p>441. <i>borwe the</i>, be surety for thee, go bail for thee.</p>

  <p>444. <i>do an other</i>, act in another way, try another course. There
  is no authority for inserting <i>thing</i> after <i>other</i>.</p>

  <p>445. Lodge says: 'and at the ende of the hall shall you see stand a
  couple of good pollaxes, one for you and another for me.'</p>

  <p>449. 'If we must in any case absolve them of their sin.' Said
  jocosely; he was going to absolve them after a good chastisement.</p>

  <p>451. St. Charity was the daughter of St. Sophia, who christened her
  three daughters <i>Fides</i>, <i>Spes</i>, and <i>Caritas</i>; see
  Butler's Lives of the Saints (Aug. 1). Cf. Percy Folio MS., i. 28; l.
  26.</p>

  <p>453. Lodge says: 'When I give you a wincke,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>456. <i>for the nones</i>, for the occasion; see note to l. 206.</p>

  <p>460. <i>leste and meste</i>, least and greatest.</p>

  <p>461. <i>halle</i>, of the hall; A. S. <i>healle</i>, gen. case of
  <i>heal</i>, a hall. Here, and in l. 496, we may take <i>halle-dore</i>
  as a compound word, but <i>halle</i> is still a genitive form.</p>

  <p>471. <i>ther that</i>, where that; as commonly.</p>

  <p>481. 'Who beggeth for thee (to come) out of prison, or who may be
  surety for thee; but ever may it be well with them that cause thee much
  sorrow.'</p>

  <p>485. 'All that may be surety for thee, may evil befall them'; lit.
  'may it befall them evilly.'</p>

  <p>489. <i>so</i>, &amp;c., 'as I hope to make use of my bones,' lit.
  bone.</p>

  <p>503. 'Gamelyn sprinkles holy water with an oaken sprig.' Said
  jocosely; Gamelyn flourishes his staff like one who sprinkles holy water.
  A <i>spire</i> is properly a springing shoot, hence a sprig or sapling.
  Cf. Troil. ii. 1335. See the Glossary.</p>

  <p>509. Mr. Jephson here remarks as follows:&mdash;'The hatred of
  churchmen, of holy water, and of everything connected with the church,
  observable in all the ballads of this class, is probably owing to the
  fact, that William the Conqueror and his immediate successors
  systematically removed the Saxon bishops and abbots, and intruded Normans
  in their stead into all the valuable preferments in England. But there
  were also other grounds for the odium in which these foreign prelates
  were held. Sharing in the duties of the common law judges, they
  participated in the aversion with which the functionaries of the law were
  naturally regarded by outlaws and robbers,' &amp;c. He also quotes, from
  the Lytel Geste of Robin Hood, the following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'These bysshopes and these archebysshoppes,</p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">Ye shall them beete and bynde;</p>
      <p>The high sheryfe of Notynghame,</p>
      <p style="margin-left:1.2em">Hym holde ye in your mynde.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 486 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page486"></a>[486]</span></p>

  <p>It may be added that Lodge entirely omits here all mention of abbot,
  prior, monk, or canon. Times had changed.</p>

  <p>514. 'Pay a liberal allowance,' i.&nbsp;e. deal your blows bountifully.</p>

  <p>515. <i>so ever</i>, &amp;c., 'as sure as ever I hear mass.' Cf. l.
  595.</p>

  <p>520. <i>telle largely</i>, count fully.</p>

  <p>523. <i>the croune</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the crown of each man's head; alluding
  to the tonsure. It means, do not spoil the tonsure on their crowns, but
  break their legs and arms.</p>

  <p>531. <i>cold reed</i>, cold counsel, unprofitable counsel. So in
  Chaucer, Nonne Prestes Tale, B. 4446; see the note. So Shakespeare has
  '<i>colder</i> tidings'; Rich. III, iv. 4. 536. Cf. l. 759 below.</p>

  <p>532. 'It had been better for us.' Cf. l. 621.</p>

  <p>533. This is ironical, and refers, as Mr. Jephson rightly says, to the
  <i>laying on of hands</i>, whereby Gamelyn made his victims deacons and
  priests after a new fashion of his own.</p>

  <p>543. <i>here love</i>, love of them; <i>here awe</i>, awe of them.
  <i>Here</i> = A.S. <i>hira</i>, gen. pl. of <i>h&#x113;</i>, he. Hence
  <i>here</i> also means 'their,' as in l. 569.</p>

  <p>558. <i>ther ... inne</i>, wherein (Gamelyn was).</p>

  <p>567. 'As I hope to have the use of my chin.' See note to l. 334.</p>

  <p>578. 'I will repay thee for thy words, when I see my opportunity.'</p>

  <p>583. <i>It ben</i>, they are; lit. it are. A common idiom in Middle
  English. See P. Plowman, C. vi. 59, ix. 217, xvi. 309; and compare <i>it
  am I</i>, as in Chaucer, Man of Lawes Tale, B. 1109.</p>

  <p>588. 'Make their beds in the fen,' i.&nbsp;e. lie down in the fen or
  mud.</p>

  <p>596. Spoken ironically. Adam offers them some refreshment. They reply,
  that his wine is not good, being too strong; indeed, so strong that it
  will not only, like ordinary wine, steal away a man's brains, but even
  take them out of his head altogether, so that they lie scattered in his
  hood. In other words. Adam's staff breaks their heads, and lets the
  brains out.</p>

  <p>606. 'It is better for us to be there at large.'</p>

  <p>609. Lodge says that they 'tooke their way towards the forest of
  Arden.'</p>

  <p>610. 'Then the sheriff found the nest, but no egg (in it).' So also in
  William of Palerne, l. 83: 'Than fond he nest and no nei&#x21D; · for
  nou&#x21D;t nas ther leued'; i.&nbsp;e. for nothing was left there. <i>No
  nei&#x21D;</i> = <i>non ei&#x21D;</i>, no egg.</p>

  <p>616. <i>and loke how he fare</i>, and let us see how he may fare.</p>

  <p>618. Here Adam merely expresses disgust of his new mode of life. In
  Lodge's novel, he begins to faint, being old. Cf. l. 817.</p>

  <p>621. <i>lever me were</i>, it would be preferable for me.</p>

  <p>631. 'After misery comes help.' So in the Proverbs of Hendyng, as said
  above, in note to l. 32. Trench, in his book On Proverbs, quotes a Hebrew
  proverb:&mdash;When the tale of bricks is doubled, Moses comes.</p>

  <p>642. 'Whoso looked aright,' i.&nbsp;e. if one were to look carefully.</p>

  <p>651. i.&nbsp;e. I only curse (or blame) myself if I yield. <!-- Page 487
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page487"></a>[487]</span></p>

  <p>652. 'Though ye fetched five more, ye would then be only twelve in
  number.' He means that he would fight twelve of them.</p>

  <p>660. In Lodge's novel, the chief is 'Gerismond the lawfull King of
  France, banished by Torismond, who with a lustie crue of Outlawes lived
  in that Forrest.' But the present text evidently refers to an English
  outlaw, such as Robin Hood.</p>

  <p>666. 'I will adventure myself as far as the door.' Spoken
  proverbially, there being no door in the wood. He means that he will
  venture within sight of the chief. <i>hadde mete</i>, might have
  food.</p>

  <p>689. 'His peace was made'; i.&nbsp;e. his pardon had been obtained.</p>

  <p>698. 'And caused his brother to be indicted.'</p>

  <p>700. <i>wolves-heed</i>, wolf's head. 'This was the ancient Saxon
  formula of outlawry, and seems to have been literally equivalent to
  setting the man's head at the same estimate as a wolf's head. In the laws
  of Edward the Confessor [§ 6], it is said of a person who has fled
  justice, 'Si postea repertus fuerit et teneri possit, vivus regi
  reddatur, vel caput ipsius si se defenderit; lupinum enim caput geret a
  die utlagacionis sue, quod ab Anglis <i>wluesheued</i> nominatur. Et hec
  sententia communis est de omnibus utlagis.'&mdash;Wright. See Thorpe,
  Ancient Laws, &amp;c., i. 445.</p>

  <p>701. <i>of his men</i>, i.&nbsp;e. (some) of his men.</p>

  <p>703. 'How the wind was turned'; i.&nbsp;e. which way the wind blew, as we
  now say.</p>

  <p>704. 'When a man's lands were seized by force or unjustly, the
  peasantry on the estates were exposed to be plundered and ill-treated by
  the followers of the intruder.'&mdash;Wright.</p>

  <p>707. 'The messengers of ill tidings, however innocent themselves,
  often experienced all the first anger of the person to whom they carried
  them, in the ages of feudal power. Hence the bearer of ill news generally
  began by deprecating the wrath of the person addressed.'&mdash;Wright.
  This was not, however, peculiar to those times. Cf. Sophocles, Antigone,
  228; 2 Hen. IV. i. I. 100; Rich. III. iv. 4. 510; Macb. v. 5. 39.</p>

  <p>709. 'I.&nbsp;e. has obtained government of the bailiwick. In former times
  ... the high sheriff was the officer personally responsible for the peace
  of his bailiwick, which he maintained by calling out the <i>posse
  comitatus</i> to assist him.'&mdash;Jephson.</p>

  <p>710. <i>doth thee crye</i>, causes thee to be proclaimed.</p>

  <p>713. 'Greet well my husbands (i.&nbsp;e. servants) and their wives.' The
  A.S. <i>wif</i> was a neuter substantive, and remained unchanged in the
  plural, like <i>sheep</i> and <i>deer</i> in modern English. We find
  <i>wif</i> as a pl. form also in Layamon, l. 1507. The present is a very
  late example.</p>

  <p>714. 'I will go to (attend) the next assizes; see note to l. 715. If
  <i>schire</i> refers to the shire or county, the result is much the same.
  In venturing into the shire of which his brother was sheriff, Gamelyn was
  boldly putting himself into his brother's power.</p>

  <p>715. <i>nexte schire</i>, may mean 'next (succeeding) assizes'; for
  <i>schire</i> <!-- Page 488 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page488"></a>[488]</span>may be used in the sense of A.&nbsp;S.
  <i>sc&#x12B;r-gem&#x14D;t</i>; and the Lat. <i>comitatus</i> meant
  <i>curia</i> as well as 'county.' See, for example, the last quotation in
  the note to l. 871.</p>

  <p>718. 'Put down his hood,' lowered his hood, so as to show his
  face.</p>

  <p>724. <i>leet take Gamelyn</i>, caused (men) to take Gamelyn; we now
  say 'caused Gamelyn to be taken,' changing the verb from active to
  passive. The active use of the verb is universal in such phrases in
  Middle English, as is still common in German. 'Er liess Gamelyn nehmen.'
  Cf. l. 733.</p>

  <p>727. <i>Ote</i> is not a common name; we find mention of 'Sir Otes de
  Lile' in Libius Disconius, l. 1103, in the Percy Folio MS., ii. 455.
  <i>Otes</i> is equivalent to 'Otho'; see Le Livere de Reis de Angletere,
  ed. Glover, p. 268, l. 6; and p. 272. The form <i>Otoun</i> or
  <i>Oton</i> is equivalent to Lat. acc. <i>Othonem</i>.</p>

  <p>732. <i>wonder sory</i>, wonderfully sorry. <i>nothing light</i>, in
  no degree light-hearted.</p>

  <p>738. 'May evil befall such another brother (as thou art)'; cf. l.
  485.</p>

  <p>744. 'I offer to bail him,' lit. I bid for him for bail;
  <i>mainprise</i> being a sb., and <i>him</i> a dative case. Mr. Jephson
  says&mdash;'I demand that he be granted to me on mainprise, or bail, till
  the assize for general gaol-delivery.'</p>

  <p>752. 'Cause (men) to deliver him at once, and to hand him over to
  me.'</p>

  <p>761. <i>sitte</i> means 'may sit'; cf. l. 749.</p>

  <p>779. <i>cors</i>, curse. He was never cursed by those with whom he had
  dealings. This can only refer to the poor whom he never oppressed. The
  author quietly ignores the strong language of the churchmen whom he
  stripped of everything. This is precisely the tone adopted in the Robin
  Hood ballads.</p>

  <p>782. <i>nom</i>, catch, take; a new form of the infinitive mood. It
  arose from the pt. t. <i>cam</i>, by analogy of <i>comen</i> from
  <i>cam</i>. See Mätzner, Alteng. Sprachproben, i. 261, l. 80.</p>

  <p>785. <i>fast aboute</i>, busily employed. See l. 240.</p>

  <p>786. <i>to hyre the quest</i>, to suborn the jury. See l. 801.</p>

  <p>790. <i>seet</i>, should sit. The A.S. for <i>sat</i> is <i>sæt</i>,
  but for <i>should sit</i> (3rd pers. sing. of the pt. t. subj.) is
  <i>s&#x1E3;te</i>. The latter became the M.E. <i>seete</i>; hence
  <i>seet</i>, by loss of the final <i>e</i>. It rimes with <i>beheet</i>
  (A.S. <i>beh&#x113;t</i>).</p>

  <p>806. <i>spet</i>, short for <i>speedeth</i>; cf. <i>stant</i> for
  <i>standeth</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>834. <i>of</i>, in. So in Shakespeare, Jul. Cæsar, ii. 1.
  157&mdash;'We shall find <i>of</i> him A shrewd contriver.'</p>

  <p>840. <i>the quest is oute</i>, the verdict is (already) delivered.</p>

  <p>852. <i>the barre</i>, the bar in front of the justice's seat; see ll.
  860, 867.</p>

  <p>864. 'It seemed a very long time to him.'</p>

  <p>871. <i>sisours</i>, jury-men. I copy the following from my note on P.
  Plowman, B. ii. 62. 'The exact signification of <i>sisour</i> does not
  seem quite certain, and perhaps it has not always the same meaning. The
  <!-- Page 489 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <i>assisiarii</i>, interpreted by Ducange to mean "qui a principe vel a
  domino feudi delegati <i>assisias</i> tenent"; whence Halliwell's
  explanation of <i>sisour</i> as a person deputed to hold assizes.

  <p>Mr. Furnivall's note says&mdash;'<i>Sysour</i>, an inquest-man at
  assizes. The <i>sisour</i> was really a juror, though differing greatly
  in functions and in position from what jurymen subsequently became; see
  Forsyth's Hist. of Trial by Jury.' In the tale of Gamelyn, however, it is
  pretty clear that 'the twelve sisours that weren of the quest' were
  simply the twelve gentlemen of the jury, who were hired to give false
  judgment (l. 786). Blount, in his Law Dictionary, says of
  <i>assisors</i>, that 'in Scotland (according to Skene) they are the same
  with our jurors.' The following stanza from A Poem of the Times of Edw.

  <p><span class="sc">Note</span>: to vol. i. p. ix. I am informed that it
  appears, from a charter in the British Museum, that one Galfridus de
  Chaucere is a witness to a grant of land to Hatfield Broad Oak Priory,
  co. Essex, about <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1300. This shews that the

  <p><span class="sc">Rom. Rose</span>, 923. <i>Turke bowes</i>, Turkish
  bows. The form <i>Turke</i> can hardly be right, as the adjective is
  required. The original copy probably had 'Turk<i>is</i>,' with the
  <i>is</i> written as a contraction; this would easily be misread as
  'Turk<i>e</i>,' i.&nbsp;e. as if the contraction stood for <i>e</i>. The
  French text has <i>ars turquois</i>, as the reader can see.</p>

  <p>Cotgrave gives: 'Arc turquois, <i>the Turkish long-bow</i>.' But the
  Turkish long-bow was short, as compared with the English. Strutt speaks
  of his seeing the Turkish ambassador shoot; this was in the year 1800.
  'The bow he used was much shorter than those belonging to the English
  archers; and his arrows were of the bolt kind, with round heads made of

  <p>There can be no doubt that (as has been suggested by the Bishop of
  Oxford) these apparently otiose lines contain punning allusions to the
  whole subject of the poem. <span class="sc">Long-castell</span> (put for
  <i>Lon-castell</i>, or the castle on the Lune) was another name for
  Lancaster; compare the modern <i>Lonsdale</i> as a name for the valley of

  expresses Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster.</p>

  <p>In the second line, the <span class="sm">RICHE HIL</span> refers to

  <p><span class="sc">Vol. III.</span> pp. 421, 422. <span
  class="sc">Sources of the Prioresses Tale.</span> It is tolerably clear
  that Chaucer really got the former part of this story from one of the
  Miracles of our Lady, by Gautier de Coinci or Coincy<a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>. And I have now little doubt that he
  adapted the latter part of it from another story in the same collection
  (and therefore in the same MS.), by the same author. It so happens that
  the latter story is printed in Bartsch and Horning's collection in 'La
  Langue et la Littérature Françaises'; Paris, 1887; col. 367. It is there
  entitled 'De Clerico Sancte Virgini devoto, in cuius iam mortui ore flos
  inuentus est.' It is rather a stupid and pointless story, to the
  following effect. There was a wicked cleric at Chartres, who gave himself
  up to all kinds of debauchery; but he had one merit. He never passed an
  image of Our Lady without kneeling down and saying a prayer. Some enemies
  killed him; and it was at once resolved to bury him in a ditch, as an
  outcast; and this was done. But Our Lady appeared to one of the chief
  clergy, and commanded that he should be buried again, in the holiest spot
  in the cemetery. When the body was recovered, it was found that the
  tongue of the corpse remained uncorrupted, being as red as a rose, and a
  miraculous flower was blossoming in his mouth. He was reburied in holy
  ground, with many tears from the pious. It was also observed that his
  tongue still slowly moved, <i>as if</i> endeavouring to sing the Virgin's
  praises.</p>

  <p>This is rather a clumsy assumption; for the tongue might have been
  trying to swear. Hence Chaucer gives it a real voice; and substitutes a
  small grain in place of the flower; probably because there was a
  well-known legend about the three grains found by Seth under Adam's
  tongue (above, p. 180, note to l. 1852). Chaucer's tale is really made
  up, with great skill, from a combination of these two poems by Gautier de
  Coinci; and it is highly remarkable that, in the Vernon MS., there is a
  version of the story which says that <i>five roses</i> were found in the
  child's head; one <i>in his mouth</i>, two in his eyes, and two in his
  ears. In the Legend of Alphonsus of Lincoln (see vol. iii. p. 421), the
  child has a precious stone in place of a tongue; but this legend was
  composed in 1459, and was probably copied from Chaucer. I think it highly
  probable that Chaucer combined the two 'Miracles' himself; though of
  course some one else may have done it before him. In any case, it is
  worth while pointing out that we must combine the two stories by de
  Coinci, before we obtain the whole of Chaucer's poem.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Vol. III.</span> pp. 502, 503. The statement that the
  French treatise by Frère Lorens, entitled La Somme des Vices et des
  Vertus, 'has never been printed,' is incorrect. However, the book is
  scarce. Mr. Bradley tells me that there is a copy of it in the British
  Museum, printed by Anthoine Verard 'sus le pont notre dame,' Paris. It is
  undated, but it is said to have been printed in 1495. <!-- Page 492

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">Canterbury Tales.</span></p>

  <p>The Canterbury Tales, and especially the Prologue, are so full of
  allusions and expressions that either require or invite illustrations,
  that no commentary upon them can be considered exhaustive. Consequently,
  those points only have, for the most part, been considered where the
  expressions used are for any reason difficult, obscure, or likely to be
  misunderstood; for it frequently happens that, by a change in meaning,
  the modern form or use of a word suggests a wrong impression.</p>

  <p>A considerable number of words and phrases which occur in Chaucer have
  already been explained by me in the Notes to Piers the Plowman. Hence, in
  many cases, additional illustrations and references can easily be had by
  consulting the 'Index to the Explanations in the Notes' printed in P.
  Plowman, vol. iv. pp. 464-491.</p>

  <p>The 'Index of Books referred to in the Notes' to the same, vol. iv.
  pp. 492-502, gives a long list of books, most of which are useful for the
  illustration of Chaucer also. I add here a few additional notes, taken
  almost at random, for two of which I am indebted to Professor Earle.</p>

  <p>A. 30. Zupitza (Notes to Guy of Warwick, 855, p. 361) further
  illustrates this line. 'There can be no doubt that the pp. <i>goon</i> is
  to be supplied.' He quotes 'to reste eode þa sunne,' Layamon, 28328;
  'until the son was gon to rest,' Iwaine, 3612, ed. Ritson (Met. Romances,
  i. 151); also from J. Grimm, Mythology, p. 702, who treats of the M.H.G.
  phrase <i>ze reste g&#x101;n</i>.</p>

  <p>A. 179. It is shown (vol. v. p. 22) that the simile about the fish out
  of water occurs in the Life of St. Anthony. Chaucer clearly took it from
  Jehan de Meung (<i>or</i> Jean de Meun); but the French poet probably
  took it from the Life of St. Anthony in the Legenda Aurea. We find it
  even in Caxton's Golden Legende:&mdash;'for lyke as fysshes that haue ben
  longe in the water whan they come in-to drye londe they muste dye, in
  lyke wyse the monkes that goon out of theyr cloystre or selles, yf they
  conuerse longe wyth seculiers they must nedes lose theyr holynesse and
  leue theyr good lyf.'</p>

  <p>A. 387. <i>With the beste</i>, 'as well as possible,' but originally
  'among the best.' So in Zupitza, notes to Guy of Warwick, l. 1496. He
  quotes Mätzner's Grammatik, II. 2. 434; King Horn, 1326, <i>knight with
  the beste</i>; &amp;c. Cf. <i>with the furste</i>, King Horn, 1119.</p>

  <p>A. 467. <i>She coude muche of wandring by the weye</i>; i.&nbsp;e. she knew
  much which she had learnt through being so great a traveller.&mdash;J.
  Earle.</p>

  <p>I have explained it above, p. 44, by&mdash;'She knew much about
  travelling.' The original will bear either interpretation; all depends
  upon the meaning of the word <i>of</i>. <!-- Page 493 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page493"></a>[493]</span></p>

  <p>A. 655. See Freeman, vol. v. p. 497, and his quotation from John of
  Salisbury, Ep. 146 (Giles, i. 260):&mdash;'Erat, ut memini, genus
  hominum, qui in ecclesia Dei <i>archidiaconorum</i> censentur nomine,
  quibus vestra discretio omnem salutis viam querebatur esse praeclusam.
  Nam, ut dicere consuevistis, diligunt munera, sequuntur retributiones, ad
  injurias proni sunt, calumniis gaudent, peccata populi comedunt et
  bibunt, quibus vivitur ex rapto, ut non sit hospes ab hospite
  tutus.'&mdash;J. Earle. [From Freeman's Hist. of the Norman Conquest, ed.
  1867-79.]</p>

  <p>Cf. the Somnours Tale; especially D. 1315, 1317, and the notes.</p>

  <p>A. 1155. For <i>par amour</i>, see all the instances referred to in
  the Glossary. The fact that it sometimes means 'with all affection,' or
  'affectionately,' is well illustrated by a passage in the Coventry
  Mysteries, p. 50, where it is put into the mouth of Abraham, when
  addressing Isaac. 'Thu art my suete childe, and <i>par amoure</i> Ful
  wele in herte do I the loue.'</p>

  <p>A. 1452. <i>Seven yeer</i> is an old proverbial expression for a long
  time; see <i>Seven-year</i> in Halliwell; P. Plowman, C. vii. 214, xi.
  73; Zupitza's notes to Guy of Warwick (l. 8667); &amp;c. The curious
  thing is that Chaucer understood himself literally: 'It fel that in the
  seventhe yeer, in May'; A. 1462.</p>

  <p>A. 2749. Some further illustration of the word <i>expulsive</i> as a
  technical term may be found in old treatises. Thus Brunetto Latini, in
  his Livres dou Tresor, livre i. part iii. chap. 103, says that the four
  virtues which sustain life are the <i>appetitive</i> (due to the element
  of fire), the <i>retentive</i> (due to earth), the <i>digestive</i> (due
  to air), and the <i>expulsive</i> (due to water). Hence we have an
  appetite for food; we retain it; we digest it; and expel it. 'L'aigue est
  froide et moiste, et fait la vertu expulsive, ce est qu'ele chace fuer la
  viande quant ele est cuite.' Sir Thos. Elyot, Castel of Helth, 1539, p.
  10, says there are three Powers, animal, spiritual, and natural. Of
  these, it is the <i>natural</i> power which 'appetiteth, retayneth,
  digesteth, expelleth'; whereas it is the 'power animall' that 'ordeyneth,
  discerneth, and composeth; that moueth by voluntarye mocyon,' &amp;c. Of
  the four 'operations,' he says that 'expulsion [is] by colde and moyste.'
  The whole of this sort of jargon is full of inconsistencies.</p>

  <p>A. 3287. <i>Do wey</i>, i.&nbsp;e. take away. So also <i>go wey</i> occurs
  for 'go away.' See these phrases plentifully illustrated in Zupitza's
  notes to Guy of Warwick, l. 3097.</p>

  <p>B. 124. After all, this line is probably merely a reproduction from Le
  Roman de la Rose, l. 10438:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Tu n'a pas geté <i>ambesas</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>B. 1983. The phrase <i>in toune</i> is, as I have said, practically
  otiose, and means nothing, being merely introduced as a tag. So again
  <i>in londe</i>, in l. 2077. For further illustrations see Zupitza's
  notes to Guy of Warwick, l. 5841. <!-- Page 494 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page494"></a>[494]</span></p>

  <p>B. 3917. A correspondent kindly reminds me that the story of Cyrus in
  Vincent of Beauvais came originally from Herodotus, who tells it, not of
  Cyrus, but of Polycrates of Samos; see Herodotus, bk. iii. capp. 124,
  125. In Herodotus, the vision is seen by the daughter.</p>

  <p>C. 406. In the long note at pp. 272-274, I have shewn that the sense
  is 'though their souls go a-gathering blackberries,' i.&nbsp;e. wander
  wherever they please. Mr. E.M. Spence suggests for comparison the
  well-known words of Falstaff (1 Hen. IV. ii. 4. 448):&mdash;'Shall the
  blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries?'</p>

  <p>C. 570. In the Accounts of Henry, Earl of Derby, on his return from
  Prussia in 1391, the following item occurs for March:&mdash;'Et per manus
  eiusdem pro ij barrellis ferreres [vessels for carrying wine on
  horseback] vini de <i>Lepe</i>, viz. lj stope per ipsum emptis ibidem, ij
  nobles'; printed for the Camden Society, ed. L. Toulmin Smith, p. 95.
  Miss Toulmin Smith quotes from Henderson's History of Wines, 1824, the
  note that Lepe wine is 'a strong white wine of Spain,' and that Lepe is
  'a small town on the sea-coast, between Ayamont and Palos, long
  celebrated for figs, raisins, and wine.' Its position was favourable, as
  it is in the part of Andalucia nearest to England. See <i>Lepe</i> in
  Pinero's Spanish Dictionary, ed. 1740.</p>

  <p>D. 110. The word <i>fore</i> occurs also, but with the Southern
  spelling <i>vore</i>, in P. Plowman, C. vii. 118; on which see my
  note.</p>

  <p>D. 325. At line 180 above (see the note), the Wife is plainly alluding
  to one of the passages in Le Roman de la Rose in which the Almageste is
  mentioned; and I have no doubt that she here refers to the other (l.
  18772). For though the passage quoted by Jean de Meun, as from the
  Almagest, is really quite different, there is a general reference, in the
  context, to the idea of contentment:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Car soffisance fait richece,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And just below:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Cil qui nous escrit l'Almageste.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>F. 226. Many examples are given in Godefroy of the use of Fr.
  <i>maistre</i> with the adjectival sense of 'principal' or 'chief.' Thus
  we find <i>la mestre yglise</i>, <i>la mestre tor</i>, <i>la maistre
  rue</i>, <i>la maistre cité</i>, <i>la maistre tente</i>. See
  <i>Maister</i> in the Glossarial Index.</p>

  <p>F. 233. Tyrwhitt remarks that a 'treatise on Perspective, under his
  name [i.&nbsp;e. of Aristotle], is mentioned by Vincent of Beauvais, in the
  thirteenth century (Speculum Historiale, lib. iii. c. 84):&mdash;"Extat
  etiam liber, qui dicitur Perspectiva Aristotelis."' See the word
  <i>Aristotle</i> in Tyrwhitt's Glossary to Chaucer.</p>

<p class="ac">END OF VOL. V.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> The scribe is usually right. I
  only remember observing one MS. in which the scribe is reckless; see vol.
  i. p. 47.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> To which add, as a twenty-third,
  the three stanzas on Gentilesse quoted in Scogan's poem (no. 33).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> Now known to be Lydgate's; see
  vol. i. p. 35, note 3.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> I have lately made a curious
  discovery as to the Testament of Love. The first paragraph begins with a
  large capital M; the second with a large capital A; and so on. By putting
  together all the letters thus pointed out, we at once have an acrostic,
  forming a complete sentence. The sentence is&mdash;MARGARET OF VIRTW,
  HAVE MERCI ON TSKNVI. Of course the last word is expressed as an anagram,
  which I decipher as KITSVN, i.&nbsp;e. Kitsun, the author's name. The whole
  piece is clearly addressed to a lady named Margaret, and contains
  frequent reference to the virtues of pearls, which were supposed to
  possess healing powers. Even if 'Kitsun' is not the right reading, we
  learn something; for it is quite clear that TSKNVI cannot possibly
  represent the name of Chaucer. See The Academy, March 11, 1893; p.
  222.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_5" href="#NtA_5">[5]</a> No. 38 is not noticed in the
  Index, on its reappearance at p. 555.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_6" href="#NtA_6">[6]</a> Originally (I understand) 1845. I
  have only a copy with a reprinted title-page and an altered date.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_7" href="#NtA_7">[7]</a> It should be&mdash;'and of
  <i>some of</i> those other pieces'; for the 'Account' does not profess to
  be exhaustive.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_8" href="#NtA_8">[8]</a> See the pieces numbered 1-68, in
  vol. i. pp. 31-45. But four pieces are in prose, viz. Boethius,
  Astrolabe, Testament of Love, and Jack Upland. Of course Tyrwhitt
  rejected Jack Upland. He admitted, however, rather more than 26, the
  number in the edition of 1845.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_9" href="#NtA_9">[9]</a> The false rime of <i>now</i> with
  <i>rescowe</i> in st. 46 may be got over, it is suggested, by a change in
  the readings. On the other hand, I now observe a fatal rhyme in st. 17,
  where <i>upon</i> and <i>ron</i> rime with <i>mon</i>, a man. When such a
  form as <i>mon</i> (for <i>man</i>) can be found in Chaucer, we may
  reconsider his claim to this poem. Meanwhile, I would note the curious
  word <i>grede</i> in st. 27. It does not occur in Chaucer, but is
  frequent in The Owl and the Nightingale.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_10" href="#NtA_10">[10]</a> Exception may be taken to the
  riming of <i>mene</i> (l. 20) with open <i>e</i>, and <i>grene</i> with
  close <i>e</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_11" href="#NtA_11">[11]</a> Hoccleve's Poems; ed.
  Furnivall, p. 49; cf. p. 56.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> See the admirable remarks on
  this subject in Lounsbury's Studies in Chaucer, i. 305-28. Much that I
  wish to say is there said for me, in a way which I cannot improve.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_13" href="#NtA_13">[13]</a> MS. Lansdowne (the worst of
  the seven) has <i>Alle</i>, and <i>Gyngelinge</i>; Cm. has
  <i>Gyngelyn</i>; Hl. has <i>Euery man</i>; and that is all.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_14" href="#NtA_14">[14]</a> The phrase <i>wel a ten</i>
  (F. 383) is not precisely parallel.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_15" href="#NtA_15">[15]</a> Thus, the Parson calls his
  Tale 'a mery' one (I. 46). Tyrwhitt has 'a litel tale.'</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_16" href="#NtA_16">[16]</a> <i>Ielousye</i> cannot rime
  with <i>me</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_17" href="#NtA_17">[17]</a> The latter line answers to A.
  2018; lines 2012-7 being wholly omitted.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_18" href="#NtA_18">[18]</a> Which, by the way, makes
  <i>come</i> monosyllabic.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_19" href="#NtA_19">[19]</a> Dryden had some reason; for
  whenever (as often) the editors omitted some essential word, the line
  could not possibly be right.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_20" href="#NtA_20">[20]</a> The explanation of these rules
  depends upon Middle-English grammar and pronunciation; for which see the
  Introduction to vol. vi.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_21" href="#NtA_21">[21]</a> A word like <i>taverne</i> is
  <i>ta-vér-ne</i>, in three syllables, if the accent be on the second
  syllable; but when it is on the first, it becomes <i>táv-ern'</i>, and is
  only dissyllabic.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_22" href="#NtA_22">[22]</a> Many of them were discovered
  by Dr. Köppell.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_23" href="#NtA_23">[23]</a> It has been objected, that
  this makes the tournament to take place, not on the <i>anniversary</i> of
  the duel, but two days later. But see l. 2095, where the anniversary of
  the duel is plainly made the day for <i>assembling the hosts</i>, not for
  the fight.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_24" href="#NtA_24">[24]</a> 'Thou were nought
  <i>skoymus</i> to take the maydenes womb' is the reading given in The
  Prymer, ed. H. Littlehales, p. 22.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_25" href="#NtA_25">[25]</a> The black-letter editions have
  <i>mare</i>; and Tyrwhitt follows them. I take this to be a mere
  guess.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_26" href="#NtA_26">[26]</a> Spelt <i>Xeuxis</i> in one
  MS., and <i>Zensis</i> in another, in the same passage; see Anglo-Latin
  Satirists, ed. Wright, ii. 303.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_27" href="#NtA_27">[27]</a> This seems to be a mistake;
  the MSS. and old editions have simply 'god you see.'</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_28" href="#NtA_28">[28]</a> The words <i>vel e
  contrario</i> are in the margin of E., but not in the printed
  edition.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_29" href="#NtA_29">[29]</a> The reading <i>Burdeuxs</i>
  actually occurs in MS. Camb. Univ. Lib. Ii. 3. 26. See <i>Boundys</i> in
  the Glossary; and see vol. iii. p. 400.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_30" href="#NtA_30">[30]</a> No quotation is given to
  support this assertion.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_31" href="#NtA_31">[31]</a> Unluckily misprinted Poincy
  (vol. iii. p. 422).</p>
